SECOND LANDING

By FLOYD WALLACE


 _A gentle fancy for the Christmas Season--an
 oft-told tale with a wistful twistful of Something
 that left the Earth with a wing and a prayer._


Earth was so far away that it wasn't visible. Even the sun was only a
twinkle. But this vast distance did not mean that isolation could endure
forever. Instruments within the ship intercepted radio broadcasts and,
within the hour, early TV signals. Machines compiled dictionaries and
grammars and began translating the major languages. The history of the
planet was tabulated as facts became available.

The course of the ship changed slightly; it was not much out of the way
to swing nearer Earth. For days the two within the ship listened and
watched with little comment. They had to decide soon.

"We've got to make or break," said the first alien.

"You know what I'm in favor of," said the second.

"I can guess," said Ethaniel, who had spoken first. "The place is a
complete mess. They've never done anything except fight each other--and
invent better weapons."

"It's not what they've done," said Bal, the second alien. "It's what
they're going to do, with that big bomb."

"The more reason for stopping," said Ethaniel. "The big bomb can destroy
them. Without our help they may do just that."

"I may remind you that in two months twenty-nine days we're due in
Willafours," said Bal. "Without looking at the charts I can tell you we
still have more than a hundred light-years to go."

"A week," said Ethaniel. "We can spare a week and still get there on
time."
