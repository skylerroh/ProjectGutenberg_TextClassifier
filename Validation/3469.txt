ornament to his head. It is the contents and not the case which
availeth. Having donned this frippery, good Master Foster and I hired
a calash and drove to the Palace. We were deep in grave and, I trust,
profitable converse speeding through the endless streets, when of a
sudden I felt a sharp tug at my head, and my hat fluttered down on to my
knees. I raised my hands, and lo! they came upon my bare pate. The wig
had vanished. We were rolling down Fleet Street at the moment, and there
was no one in the calash save neighbour Foster, who sat as astounded as
I. We looked high and low, on the seats and beneath them, but not a sign
of the periwig was there. It was gone utterly and without a trace.'

'Whither then?' we asked with one voice.

'That was the question which we set ourselves to solve. For a moment I
do assure ye that we bethought us that it might be a judgment upon us
for our attention to such carnal follies. Then it crossed my mind
that it might be the doing of some malicious sprite, as the Drummer of
Tedworth, or those who occasioned the disturbances no very long time
since at the old Gast House at Little Burton here in Somersetshire.
(Note F. Appendix.) With this thought we hallooed to the coachman, and
told him what had occurred to us. The fellow came down from his
perch, and having heard our story, he burst straightway into much foul
language, and walking round to the back of his calash, showed us that
a slit had been made in the leather wherewith it was fashioned. Through
this the thief had thrust his hand and had drawn my wig through the
hole, resting the while on the crossbar of the coach. It was no uncommon
thing, he said, and the wig-snatchers were a numerous body who waited
beside the peruke-maker's shops, and when they saw a customer come forth
with a purchase which was worth their pains they would follow him, and,
should he chance to drive, deprive him of it in this fashion. Be that as
it may, I never saw my wig again, and had to purchase another before I
could venture into the royal presence.'

'A strange adventure truly,' exclaimed Saxon. 'How fared it with you for
the remainder of the evening?'

'But scurvily, for Charles's face, which was black enough at all
times, was blackest of all to us; nor was his brother the Papist more
complaisant. They had but brought us there that they might dazzle us
with their glitter and gee-gaws, in order that we might bear a fine
report of them back to the West with us. There were supple-backed
courtiers, and strutting nobles, and hussies with their shoulders bare,
who should for all their high birth have been sent to Bridewell as
readily as any poor girl who ever walked at the cart's tail. Then there
were the gentlemen of the chamber, with cinnamon and plum-coloured
coats, and a brave show of gold lace and silk and ostrich feather.
Neighbour Foster and I felt as two crows might do who have wandered
among the peacocks. Yet we bare in mind in whose image we were
fashioned, and we carried ourselves, I trust, as independent English
burghers. His Grace of Buckingham had his flout at us, and Rochester
sneered, and the women simpered; but we stood four square, my friend
and I, discussing, as I well remember, the most precious doctrines of
election and reprobation, without giving much heed either to those who
mocked us, or to the gamesters upon our left, or to the dancers upon
our right. So we stood throughout the evening, until, finding that they
could get little sport from us, my Lord Clarendon, the Chancellor, gave
us the word to retire, which we did at our leisure after saluting the
King and the company.'

'Nay, that I should never have done!' cried the young Puritan, who had
listened intently to his elder's narrative. 'Would it not have been
more fitting to have raised up your hands and called down vengeance upon
them, as the holy man of old did upon the wicked cities?'

'More fitting, quotha!' said the Mayor impatiently. 'It is most fitting
that youth should be silent until his opinion is asked on such matters.
God's wrath comes with leaden feet, but it strikes with iron hands. In
His own good time He has judged when the cup of these men's iniquities
is overflowing. It is not for us to instruct Him. Curses have, as the
wise man said, a habit of coming home to roost. Bear that in mind,
Master John Derrick, and be not too liberal with them.'

The young apprentice, for such he was, bowed his head sullenly to the
rebuke, whilst the Mayor, after a short pause, resumed his story.

'Being a fine night,' said he, 'we chose to walk back to our lodgings;
but never shall I forget the wicked scenes wherewith we were encountered
on the way. Good Master Bunyan, of Elstow, might have added some
pages to his account of Vanity Fair had he been with us. The women,
be-patched, be-ruddled, and brazen; the men swaggering, roistering,
cursing--the brawling, the drabbing, and the drunkenness! It was a fit
kingdom to be ruled over by such a court. At last we had made our way to
more quiet streets, and were hoping that our adventures were at an end,
when of a sudden there came a rush of half-drunken cavaliers from a side
street, who set upon the passers-by with their swords, as though we had
fallen into an ambuscade of savages in some Paynim country. They were,
as I surmise, of the same breed as those of whom the excellent John
Milton wrote: "The sons of Belial, flown with insolence and wine." Alas!
my memory is not what it was, for at one time I could say by rote whole
books of that noble and godly poem.'

'And, pray, how fared ye with these rufflers, sir?' I asked.

'They beset us, and some few other honest citizens who were wending
their ways homewards, and waving their naked swords they called upon us
to lay down our arms and pay homage. "To whom?" I asked. They pointed
to one of their number who was more gaudily dressed and somewhat
drunker than the rest. "This is our most sovereign liege," they cried.
"Sovereign over whom?" I asked. "Over the Tityre Tus," they answered.
"Oh, most barbarous and cuckoldy citizen, do you not recognise that you
have fallen into the hands of that most noble order?" "This is not your
real monarch," said I, "for he is down beneath us chained in the pit,
where some day he will gather his dutiful subjects around him." "Lo, he
hath spoken treason!" they cried, on which, without much more ado, they
set upon us with sword and dagger. Neighbour Foster and I placed our
backs against a wall, and with our cloaks round our left arms we made
play with our tucks, and managed to put in one or two of the old Wigan
Lane raspers. In particular, friend Foster pinked the King in such wise
that his Majesty ran howling down the street like a gored bull-pup. We
were beset by numbers, however, and might have ended our mission then
and there had not the watch appeared upon the scene, struck up our
weapons with their halberds, and so arrested the whole party. Whilst the
fray lasted the burghers from the adjoining houses were pouring water
upon us, as though we were cats on the tiles, which, though it did
not cool our ardour in the fight, left us in a scurvy and unsavoury
condition. In this guise we were dragged to the round-house, where we
spent the night amidst bullies, thieves, and orange wenches, to whom I
am proud to say that both neighbour Foster and myself spoke some words
of joy and comfort. In the morning we were released, and forthwith shook
the dust of London from our feet; nor do I ever wish to return thither,
unless it be at the head of our Somersetshire regiments, to see King
Monmouth don the crown which he had wrested in fair fight from the
Popish perverter.'

As Master Stephen Timewell ended his tale a general shuffling and rising
announced the conclusion of the meal. The company filed slowly out in
order of seniority, all wearing the same gloomy and earnest expression,
with grave gait and downcast eyes. These Puritan ways were, it is true,
familiar to me from childhood, yet I had never before seen a large
household conforming to them, or marked their effect upon so many young
men.

'You shall bide behind for a while,' said the Mayor, as we were about
to follow the others. 'William, do you bring a flask of the old green
sealed sack. These creature comforts I do not produce before my lads,
for beef and honest malt is the fittest food for such. On occasion,
however, I am of Paul's opinion, that a flagon of wine among friends is
no bad thing for mind or for body. You can away now, sweetheart, if you
have aught to engage you.'

'Do you go out again?' asked Mistress Ruth.

'Presently, to the town-hall. The survey of arms is not yet complete.'

'I shall have your robes ready, and also the rooms of our guests,' she
answered, and so, with a bright smile to us, tripped away upon her duty.

'I would that I could order our town as that maiden orders this house,'
said the Mayor. 'There is not a want that is not supplied before it is
felt. She reads my thoughts and acts upon them ere my lips have time to
form them. If I have still strength to spend in the public service, it
is because my private life is full of restful peace. Do not fear the
sack, sirs. It cometh from Brooke and Hellier's of Abchurch Lane, and
may be relied upon.'

'Which showeth that one good thing cometh out of London,' remarked Sir
Gervas.

'Aye, truly,' said the old man, smiling. 'But what think ye of my young
men, sir? They must needs be of a very different class to any with
whom you are acquainted, if, as I understand, you have frequented court
circles.'

'Why, marry, they are good enough young men, no doubt,' Sir Gervas
answered lightly. 'Methinks, however, that there is a want of sap about
them. It is not blood, but sour buttermilk that flows in their veins.'

'Nay, nay,' the Mayor responded warmly. 'There you do them an injustice.
Their passions and feelings are under control, as the skilful rider
keeps his horse in hand; but they are as surely there as is the speed
and endurance of the animal. Did you observe the godly youth who sat
upon your right, whom I had occasion to reprove more than once for
over-zeal? He is a fit example of how a man may take the upper hand of
his feelings, and keep them in control.'

'And how has he done so?' I asked.

'Why, between friends,' quoth the Mayor, 'it was but last Lady-day that
he asked the hand of my granddaughter Ruth in marriage. His time is
nearly served, and his father, Sam Derrick, is an honourable craftsman,
so that the match would have been no unfitting one. The maiden turned
against him, however--young girls will have their fancies--and the
matter came to an end. Yet here he dwells under the same roof-tree, at
her elbow from morn to night, with never a sign of that passion which
can scarce have died out so soon. Twice my wool warehouse hath been
nigh burned to the ground since then, and twice he hath headed those who
fought the flames. There are not many whose suit hath been rejected who
would bear themselves in so resigned and patient a fashion.'

'I am prepared to find that your judgment is the correct one,' said Sir
Gervas Jerome. 'I have learned to distrust too hasty dislikes, and bear
in mind that couplet of John Dryden--

          "Errors, like straws, upon the surface flow.
           He who would search for pearls must dive below."'

'Or worthy Dr. Samuel Butler,' said Saxon, 'who, in his immortal poem of
"Hudibras," says--

          "The fool can only see the skin:
           The wise man tries to peep within."'

'I wonder, Colonel Saxon,' said our host severely, 'that you should
speak favourably of that licentious poem, which is composed, as I have
heard, for the sole purpose of casting ridicule upon the godly. I should
as soon have expected to hear you praise the wicked and foolish work of
Hobbes, with his mischievous thesis, "A Deo rex, a rege lex."'

'It is true that I contemn and despise the use which Butler hath made of
his satire,' said Saxon adroitly; 'yet I may admire the satire itself,
just as one may admire a damascened blade without approving of the
quarrel in which it is drawn.'

'These distinctions are, I fear, too subtle for my old brain,' said the
stout old Puritan. 'This England of ours is divided into two camps, that
of God and that of Antichrist. He who is not with us is against us, nor
shall any who serve under the devil's banner have anything from me save
my scorn and the sharp edge of my sword.'

'Well, well,' said Saxon, filling up his glass, 'I am no Laodicean or
time-server. The cause shall not find me wanting with tongue or with
sword.'

'Of that I am well convinced, my worthy friend,' the Mayor answered,
'and if I have spoken over sharply you will hold me excused. But I
regret to have evil tidings to announce to you. I have not told the
commonalty lest it cast them down, but I know that adversity will be
but the whetstone to give your ardour a finer edge. Argyle's rising has
failed, and he and his companions are prisoners in the hands of the man
who never knew what pity was.'

We all started in our chairs at this, and looked at one another aghast,
save only Sir Gervas Jerome, whose natural serenity was, I am well
convinced, proof against any disturbance. For you may remember, my
children, that I stated when I first took it in hand to narrate to you
these passages of my life, that the hopes of Monmouth's party rested
very much upon the raid which Argyle and the Scottish exiles had
made upon Ayrshire, where it was hoped that they would create such a
disturbance as would divert a good share of King James's forces, and so
make our march to London less difficult. This was the more confidently
expected since Argyle's own estates lay upon that side of Scotland,
where he could raise five thousand swordsmen among his own clansmen.
The western counties abounded, too, in fierce zealots who were ready to
assert the cause of the Covenant, and who had proved themselves in many
a skirmish to be valiant warriors. With the help of the Highlanders and
of the Covenanters it seemed certain that Argyle would be able to hold
his own, the more so since he took with him to Scotland the English
Puritan Rumbold, and many others skilled in warfare. This sudden news
of his total defeat and downfall was therefore a heavy blow, since it
turned the whole forces of the Government upon ourselves.

'Have you the news from a trusty source?' asked Decimus Saxon, after a
long silence.

'It is beyond all doubt or question,' Master Stephen Timewell answered.
'Yet I can well understand your surprise, for the Duke had trusty
councillors with him. There was Sir Patrick Hume of Polwarth--'

'All talk and no fight,' said Saxon.

'And Richard Rumbold.'

'All fight and no talk,' quoth our companion. 'He should, methinks, have
rendered a better account of himself.'

'Then there was Major Elphinstone.'

'A bragging fool!' cried Saxon.'

'And Sir John Cochrane.'

'A captious, long-tongued, short-witted sluggard,' said the soldier of
fortune. 'The expedition was doomed from the first with such men at
its head. Yet I had thought that could they have done nought else, they
might at least have flung themselves into the mountain country, where
these bare-legged caterans could have held their own amid their native
clouds and mists. All taken, you say! It is a lesson and a warning
to us. I tell you that unless Monmouth infuses more energy into his
councils, and thrusts straight for the heart instead of fencing and
foining at the extremities, we shall find ourselves as Argyle and
Rumbold. What mean these two days wasted at Axminster at a time when
every hour is of import? Is he, every time that he brushes a party
of militia aside, to stop forty-eight hours and chant "Te Deums" when
Churchill and Feversham are, as I know, pushing for the West with every
available man, and the Dutch grenadiers are swarming over like rats into
a granary?'

'You are very right, Colonel Saxon,' the Mayor answered. 'And I trust
that when the King comes here we may stir him up to more prompt action.
He has much need of more soldierly advisers, for since Fletcher hath
gone there is hardly a man about him who hath been trained to arms.'

'Well,' said Saxon moodily, 'now that Argyle hath gone under we are face
to face with James, with nothing but our own good swords to trust to.'

'To them and to the justice of our cause. How like ye the news, young
sirs? Has the wine lost its smack on account of it? Are ye disposed to
flinch from the standard of the Lord?'

'For my own part I shall see the matter through,' said I.

'And I shall bide where Micah Clarke bides,' quoth Reuben Lockarby.

'And to me,' said Sir Gervas, 'it is a matter of indifference, so long
as I am in good company and there is something stirring.'

'In that case,' said the Mayor, 'we had best each turn to his own work,
and have all ready for the King's arrival. Until then I trust that ye
will honour my humble roof.'

'I fear that I cannot accept your kindness,' Saxon answered. 'When I am
in harness I come and go early and late. I shall therefore take up my
quarters in the inn, which is not very well furnished with victual,
and yet can supply me with the simple fare, which with a black Jack of
October and a pipe of Trinidado is all I require.'

As Saxon was firm in this resolution the Mayor forbore to press it upon
him, but my two friends gladly joined with me in accepting the worthy
wool-worker's offer, and took up our quarters for the time under his
hospitable roof.



Chapter XIX. Of a Brawl in the Night

Decimus Saxon refused to avail himself of Master Timewell's house and
table for the reason, as I afterwards learned, that, the Mayor being a
firm Presbyterian, he thought it might stand him in ill stead with the
Independents and other zealots were he to allow too great an intimacy
to spring up between them. Indeed, my dears, from this time onward this
cunning man framed his whole life and actions in such a way as to make
friends of the sectaries, and to cause them to look upon him as their
leader. For he had a firm belief that in all such outbreaks as that in
which we were engaged, the most extreme party is sure in the end to gain
the upper hand. 'Fanatics,' he said to me one day, 'mean fervour, and
fervour means hard work, and hard work means power.' That was the centre
point of all his plotting and scheming.

And first of all he set himself to show how excellent a soldier he was,
and he spared neither time nor work to make this apparent. From morn
till midday, and from afternoon till night, we drilled and drilled until
in very truth the shouting of the orders and the clatter of the arms
became wearisome to our ears. The good burghers may well have
thought that Colonel Saxon's Wiltshire foot were as much part of the
market-place as the town cross or the parish stocks. There was much to
be done in very little time, so much that many would have thought it
hopeless to attempt it. Not only was there the general muster of the
regiment, but we had each to practise our own companies in their several
drills, and to learn as best we could the names and the wants of the
men. Yet our work was made easier to us by the assurance that it was not
thrown away, for at every gathering our bumpkins stood more erect,
and handled their weapons more deftly. From cock-crow to sun-down the
streets resounded with 'Poise your muskets! Order your muskets! Rest
your muskets! Handle your primers!' and all the other orders of the old
manual exercise.

As we became more soldierly we increased in numbers, for our smart
appearance drew the pick of the new-comers into our ranks. My own
company swelled until it had to be divided, and others enlarged in
proportion. The baronet's musqueteers mustered a full hundred, skilled
for the most part in the use of the gun. Altogether we sprang from
three hundred to four hundred and fifty, and our drill improved until we
received praise from all sides on the state of our men.

Late in the evening I was riding slowly back to the house of Master
Timewell when Reuben clattered after me, and besought me to turn back
with him to see a noteworthy sight. Though feeling little in the mood
for such things, I turned Covenant and rode with him down the length of
High Street, and into the suburb which is known as Shuttern, where my
companion pulled up at a bare barn-like building, and bade me look in
through the window.

The interior, which consisted of a single great hall, the empty
warehouse in which wool had used to be stored, was all alight with lamps
and candles. A great throng of men, whom I recognised as belonging to
my own company, or that of my companion, lay about on either side, some
smoking, some praying, and some burnishing their arms. Down the middle a
line of benches had been drawn up, on which there were seated astraddle
the whole hundred of the baronet's musqueteers, each engaged in plaiting
into a queue the hair of the man who sat in front of him. A boy walked
up and down with a pot of grease, by the aid of which with some whipcord
the work was going forward merrily. Sir Gervas himself with a great
flour dredger sat perched upon a bale of wool at the head of the line,
and as quickly as any queue was finished he examined it through his
quizzing glass, and if it found favour in his eyes, daintily powdered it
from his dredger, with as much care and reverence as though it were some
service of the Church. No cook seasoning a dish could have added
his spices with more nicety of judgment than our friend displayed in
whitening the pates of his company. Glancing up from his labours he saw
our two smiling faces looking in at him through the window, but his work
was too engrossing to allow him to leave it, and we rode off at last
without having speech with him.

By this time the town was very quiet and still, for the folk in those
parts were early bed-goers, save when some special occasion kept them
afoot. We rode slowly together through the silent streets, our horses'
hoofs ringing out sharp against the cobble stones, talking about such
light matters as engage the mind of youth. The moon was shining very
brightly above us, silvering the broad streets, and casting a fretwork
of shadows from the peaks and pinnacles of the churches. At Master
Timewell's courtyard I sprang from my saddle, but Reuben, attracted by
the peace and beauty of the scene, rode onwards with the intention of
going as far as the town gate.

I was still at work upon my girth buckles, undoing my harness, when of
a sudden there came from the street a shouting and a rushing, with the
clinking of blades, and my comrade's voice calling upon me for help.
Drawing my sword I ran out. Some little way down there was a clear
space, white with the moonshine, in the centre of which I caught a
glimpse of the sturdy figure of my friend springing about with an
activity for which I had never given him credit, and exchanging sword
thrusts with three or four men who were pressing him closely. On the
ground there lay a dark figure, and behind the struggling group Reuben's
mare reared and plunged in sympathy with her master's peril. As I rushed
down, shouting and waving my sword, the assailants took flight down
a side street, save one, a tall sinewy swordsman, who rushed in upon
Reuben, stabbing furiously at him, and cursing him the while for a
spoil-sport. To my horror I saw, as I ran, the fellow's blade slip
inside my friend's guard, who threw up his arms and fell prostrate,
while the other with a final thrust dashed off down one of the narrow
winding lanes which lead from East Street to the banks of the Tone.

'For Heaven's sake where are you hurt?' I cried, throwing myself upon my
knees beside his prostrate body. 'Where is your injury, Reuben?'

'In the wind, mostly,' quoth he, blowing like a smithy bellows;
'likewise on the back of my pate. Give me your hand, I pray.'

'And are you indeed scathless?' I cried, with a great lightening of
the heart as I helped him to his feet. 'I thought that the villain had
stabbed you.'

'As well stab a Warsash crab with a bodkin,' said he. 'Thanks to good
Sir Jacob Clancing, once of Snellaby Hall and now of Salisbury Plain,
their rapiers did no more than scratch my plate of proof. But how is it
with the maid?'

'The maid?' said I.

'Aye, it was to save her that I drew. She was beset by these night
walkers. See, she rises! They threw her down when I set upon them.'

'How is it with you, Mistress?' I asked; for the prostrate figure
had arisen and taken the form of a woman, young and graceful to all
appearance, with her face muffled in a mantle. 'I trust that you have
met with no hurt.'

'None, sir,' she answered, in a low, sweet voice, 'but that I have
escaped is due to the ready valour of your friend, and the guiding
wisdom of Him who confutes the plots of the wicked. Doubtless a true man
would have rendered this help to any damsel in distress, and yet it may
add to your satisfaction to know that she whom you have served is no
stranger to you.' With these words she dropped her mantle and turned her
face towards us in the moonlight.

'Good lack! it is Mistress Timewell!' I cried, in amazement.

'Let us homewards,' she said, in firm, quick tones. 'The neighbours are
alarmed, and there will be a rabble collected anon. Let us escape from
the babblement.'

Windows had indeed begun to clatter up in every direction, and loud
voices to demand what was amiss. Far away down the street we could
see the glint of lanthorns swinging to and fro as the watch hurried
thitherwards. We slipped along in the shadow, however, and found
ourselves safe within the Mayor's courtyard without let or hindrance.

'I trust, sir, that you have really met with no hurt,' said the maiden
to my companion.

Reuben had said not a word since she had uncovered her face, and bore
the face of a man who finds himself in some pleasant dream and is vexed
only by the fear lest he wake up from it. 'Nay, I am not hurt,' he
answered, 'but I would that you could tell us who these roving blades
may be, and where they may be found.'

'Nay, nay,' said she, with uplifted finger, 'you shall not follow the
matter further. As to the men, I cannot say with certainty who they
may have been. I had gone forth to visit Dame Clatworthy, who hath the
tertian ague, and they did beset me on my return. Perchance they are
some who are not of my grandfather's way of thinking in affairs of
State, and who struck at him through me. But ye have both been so kind
that ye will not refuse me one other favour which I shall ask ye?'

We protested that we could not, with our hands upon our sword-hilts.

'Nay, keep them for the Lord's quarrel,' said she, smiling at the
action. 'All that I ask is that ye will say nothing if this matter to my
grandsire. He is choleric, and a little matter doth set him in a flame,
so old as he is. I would not have his mind turned from the public needs
to a private trifle of this sort. Have I your promises?'

'Mine,' said I, bowing.

'And mine,' said Lockarby.

'Thanks, good friends. Alack! I have dropped my gauntlet in the street.
But it is of no import. I thank God that no harm has come to any one. My
thanks once more, and may pleasant dreams await ye.' She sprang up the
steps and was gone in an instant.

Reuben and I unharnessed our horses and saw them cared for in silence.
We then entered the house and ascended to our chambers, still without a
word. Outside his room door my friend paused.

'I have heard that long man's voice before, Micah,' said he.

'And so have I,' I answered. 'The old man must beware of his 'prentices.
I have half a mind to go back for the little maiden's gauntlet.'

A merry twinkle shot through the cloud which hid gathered on Reuben's
brow. He opened his left hand and showed me the doe-skin glove crumpled
up in his palm.

'I would not barter it for all the gold in her grandsire's coffers,'
said he, with a sudden outflame, and then half-laughing, half-blushing
at his own heat, he whisked in and left me to my thoughts.

And so I learned for the first time, my dears, that my good comrade had
been struck by the little god's arrows. When a man's years number one
score, love springs up in him, as the gourd grew in the Scriptures, in a
single night. I have told my story ill if I have not made you understand
that my friend was a frank, warm-hearted lad of impulse, whose reason
seldom stood sentry over his inclinations. Such a man can no more draw
away from a winning maid than the needle can shun the magnet. He loves
as the mavis sings or the kitten plays. Now, a slow-witted, heavy fellow
like myself, in whose veins the blood has always flowed somewhat coolly
and temperately, may go into love as a horse goes into a shelving
stream, step by step, but a man like Reuben is kicking his heels upon
the bank one moment, and is over ears in the deepest pool the nest.

Heaven only knows what match it was that had set the tow alight. I can
but say that from that day on my comrade was sad and cloudy one hour,
gay and blithesome the next. His even flow of good spirits had deserted
him, and he became as dismal as a moulting chicken, which has ever
seemed to me to be one of the strangest outcomes of what poets have
called the joyous state of love. But, indeed, pain and pleasure are so
very nearly akin in this world, that it is as if they were tethered
in neighbouring stalls, and a kick would at any time bring down the
partition. Here is a man who is as full of sighs as a grenade is of
powder, his face is sad, his brow is downcast, his wits are wandering;
yet if you remark to him that it is an ill thing that he should be
in this state, he will answer you, as like as not, that he would not
exchange it for all the powers and principalities. Tears to him are
golden, and laughter is but base coin. Well, my dears, it is useless
for me to expound to you that which I cannot myself understand. If, as I
have heard, it is impossible to get the thumb-marks of any two men to
be alike, how can we expect their inmost thoughts and feelings to tally?
Yet this I can say with all truth, that when I asked your grandmother's
hand I did not demean myself as if I were chief mourner at a funeral.
She will bear me out that I walked up to her with a smile upon my face,
though mayhap there was a little flutter at my heart, and I took her
hand and I said--but, lack-a-day, whither have I wandered? What has all
this to do with Taunton town and the rising of 1685?

On the night of Wednesday, June 17, we learned that the King, as
Monmouth was called throughout the West, was lying less than ten miles
off with his forces, and that he would make his entry into the loyal
town of Taunton the next morning. Every effort was made, as ye may well
guess, to give him a welcome which should be worthy of the most Whiggish
and Protestant town in England. An arch of evergreens had already
been built up at the western gate, bearing the motto, 'Welcome to King
Monmouth!' and another spanned the entrance to the market-place from the
upper window of the White Hart Inn, with 'Hail to the Protestant Chief!'
in great scarlet letters. A third, if I remember right, bridged the
entrance to the Castle yard, but the motto on it has escaped me. The
cloth and wool industry is, as I have told you, the staple trade of
the town, and the merchants had no mercy on their wares, but used them
freely to beautify the streets. Rich tapestries, glossy velvets, and
costly brocades fluttered from the windows or lined the balconies. East
Street, High Street, and Fore Street were draped from garret to basement
with rare and beautiful fabrics, while gay flags hung from the roofs
on either side, or fluttered in long festoons from house to house.
The royal banner of England floated from the lofty tower of St. Mary
Magdalene, while the blue ensign of Monmouth waved from the sister
turret of St. James. Late into the night there was planing and
hammering, working and devising, until when the sun rose upon Thursday,
June 18, it shone on as brave a show of bunting and evergreen as ever
graced a town. Taunton had changed as by magic from a city into a flower
garden.

Master Stephen Timewell had busied himself in these preparations, but he
had borne in mind at the same time that the most welcome sight which
he could present to Monmouth's eyes was the large body of armed men who
were prepared to follow his fortunes. There were sixteen hundred in the
town, two hundred of which were horse, mostly well armed and equipped.
These were disposed in such a way that the King should pass them in his
progress. The townsmen lined the market-place three deep from the
Castle gate to the entrance to the High Street; from thence to Shuttern,
Dorsetshire, and Frome peasants were drawn up on either side of the
street; while our own regiment was stationed at the western gate. With
arms well burnished, serried ranks, and fresh sprigs of green in every
bonnet, no leader could desire a better addition to his army. When
all were in their places, and the burghers and their wives had arrayed
themselves in their holiday gear, with gladsome faces and baskets of
new-cut flowers, all was ready for the royal visitor's reception.
