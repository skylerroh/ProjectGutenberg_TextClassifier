         off course

First on the scene were Larry Dermott and Tim Casey of the State Highway
Patrol. They assumed they were witnessing the crash of a new type of Air
Force plane and slipped and skidded desperately across the field to
within thirty feet of the strange craft, only to discover that the
landing had been made without accident.

Patrolman Dermott shook his head. "They're gettin' queerer looking every
year. Get a load of it--no wheels, no propeller, no cockpit."

They left the car and made their way toward the strange egg-shaped
vessel.

Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its holster and said, "Sure, and I'm
beginning to wonder if it's one of ours. No insignia and--"

A circular door slid open at that point and Dameri Tass stepped out,
yawning. He spotted them, smiled and said, "Glork."

They gaped at him.

"Glork is right," Dermott swallowed.

Tim Casey closed his mouth with an effort. "Do you mind the color of his
face?" he blurted.

"How could I help it?"

Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance
and yawned again. "Gorra manigan horp soratium," he said.
