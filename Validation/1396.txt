    _At least a contributing factor to the current cycle of science
    fiction movies being made in Hollywood is the touchiness of
    minorities having their nationals being portrayed as villains.
    Cinema-makers are now trying to avoid further boycotts by using
    space aliens for villains. But suppose some of our Extraterrestrial
    neighbors are also a bit touchy?_

 Pity the poor purveyor of mere entertainment in today's world.
 He can't afford to offend a soul, yet must have a villain.


Twenty-five years ago Cyril Bezdek and E. Carter Dorwin would have met
in a private railway car belonging to one of them. They might even have
met in a private train. At any rate they would have met in absolute
privacy. But it being the present, they had to be content with a series
of adjoining rooms taking up less than one half of a car on the
Super-Sachem, fastest coast-to-coast train in the country.

Their meeting in private was very important. Upon its results hinged the
future of Gigantic Studios, one of Hollywood's big three production
companies.

Dorwin was the powerful plenipotentiary of the Consolidated Trust
Company of Manhattan and backer of Gigantic's multimillion-dollar
productions. He was on his way West to make sure that the interests of
his bank were being adequately served by the studio.

Bezdek was Gigantic's supreme production boss. Former office boy,
writer, prop man, assistant-director, director, producer, and story
editor, he was the works--unless Dorwin decided otherwise during this
meeting and pulled the props out from under him. He had thought Dorwin's
trip sufficiently important to fly to Kansas City and get aboard the
Super-Sachem to be with the banker during the remainder of his trip.
