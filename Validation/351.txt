THE ADVENTURES OF JERRY MUSKRAT

By Thornton W. Burgess




CHAPTER I: Jerry Muskrat Has A Fright

What was it Mother Muskrat had said about Farmer Brown's boy and his
traps? Jerry Muskrat sat on the edge of the Big Rock and kicked his
heels while he tried to remember. The fact is, Jerry had not half
heeded. He had been thinking of other things. Besides, it seemed to him
that Mother Muskrat was altogether foolish about a great many things.

"Pooh!" said Jerry, throwing out his chest, "I guess I can take care of
myself without being tied to my mother's apron strings! What if Farmer
Brown's boy is setting traps around the Smiling Pool? I guess he can't
fool your Uncle Jerry. He isn't so smart as he thinks he is; I can fool
him any day." Jerry chuckled. He was thinking of how he had once fooled
Farmer Brown's boy into thinking a big trout was on his hook.

Slowly Jerry slid into the Smiling Pool and swam over towards his
favorite log. Peter Rabbit stuck his head over the edge of the bank.
"Hi, Jerry," he shouted, "last night I saw Farmer Brown's boy coming
over this way with a lot of traps. Better watch out!"

"Go chase yourself, Peter Rabbit. I guess I can look out for myself,"
replied Jerry, just a little crossly.

Peter made a wry face and started for the sweet clover patch. Hardly was
he out of sight when Billy Mink and Bobby Coon came down the Laughing
Brook together. They seemed very much excited. When they saw Jerry
Muskrat, they beckoned for him to come over where they were, and when he
got there, they both talked at once, and it was all about Farmer Brown's
boy and his traps.

"You'd better watch out, Jerry," warned Billy Mink, who is a great
traveler and has had wide experience.

"Oh, I guess I'm able to take care of myself," said Jerry airily, and
once more started for his favorite log. And what do you suppose he was
thinking about as he swam along? He was wishing that he knew what a trap
looked like, for despite his boasting he didn't even know what he was
to look out for. As he drew near his favorite log, something tickled his
nose. He stopped swimming to sniff and sniff. My, how good it did smell!
And it seemed to come right straight from the old log. Jerry began to
swim as fast as he could. In a few minutes he scrambled out on the
old log. Then Jerry rubbed his eyes three times to be sure that he saw
aright. There were luscious pieces of carrot lying right in front of
him.

Now there is nothing that Jerry Muskrat likes better than carrot. So
he didn't stop to wonder how it got there. He just reached out for the
nearest piece and ate it. Then he reached for the next piece and ate it.
Then he did a funny little dance just for joy. When he was quite out of
breath, he sat down to rest. Snap! Something had Jerry Muskrat by the
tail! Jerry squealed with fright and pain. Oh, how it did hurt! He
twisted and turned, but he was held fast and could not see what had him.
Then he pulled and pulled, until it seemed as if his tail would pull
off. But it didn't. So he kept pulling, and pretty soon the thing let go
so suddenly that Jerry tumbled head first into the water.

When he reached home, Mother Muskrat did his sore tail up for him. "What
did I tell you about traps?" she asked severely.

Jerry stopped crying. "Was that a trap?" he asked. Then he remembered
that in his fright he didn't even see it. "Oh, dear," he moaned, "I
wouldn't know one to-day if I met it."



CHAPTER II: The Convention At The Big Rock

Jolly round, red Mr. Sun looked down on the Smiling Pool. He almost
forgot to keep on climbing up in the blue sky, he was so interested in
what he saw there. What do you think it was? Why, it was a convention at
the Big Rock, the queerest convention he ever had seen. Your papa would
say that it was a mass-meeting of angry citizens. Maybe it was, but that
is a pretty long term. Anyway, Mother Muskrat said it was a convention,
and she ought to know, for she is the one who had called it.

Of course Jerry Muskrat was there, and his uncles and aunts and all
his cousins. Billy Mink was there, and all his relations, even old
Grandfather Mink, who has lost most of his teeth and is a little hard of
hearing.

Little Joe Otter was there, with his father and mother and all his
relations even to his third cousins. Bobby Coon was there, and he had
brought with him every Coon of his acquaintance who ever fished in the
Smiling Pool or along the Laughing Brook. And everybody was looking very
solemn, very solemn indeed.

When the last one had arrived, Mother Muskrat climbed up on the Big Rock
and called Jerry Muskrat up beside her, where all could see him. Then
she made a speech. "Friends of the Smiling Pool and Laughing Brook,"
began Mrs. Muskrat, "I have called you together to show you what has
happened to my son Jerry and to ask your advice." She stopped and
pointed to Jerry's sore tail. "What do you think did that?" she
demanded.

"Probably Jerry's been in a fight and got whipped," said Bobby Coon to
his neighbor, for Bobby Coon is a graceless young scamp and does not
always show proper respect to his neighbors.

Mrs. Muskrat glared at him, for she had overheard the remark. Then she
held up one hand to command silence. "Friends, it was a trap--a trap
set by Farmer Brown's boy! a trap to catch you and me and our children!"
said she solemnly. "It is no longer safe for our little folks to play
around the Smiling Pool or along the Laughing Brook. What are we going
to do about it?"

Everybody looked at everybody else in dismay. Then everybody began to
talk at once, and if Farmer Brown's boy could have heard all the things
said about him, his cheeks certainly would have burned. Indeed, I am
afraid that they would have blistered. Such excitement! Everybody had
a different idea, and nobody would listen to anybody else. Old Mr. Mink
lost his temper and called Grandpa Otter a meddlesome know-nothing. It
looked very much as if the convention was going to break up in a sad
quarrel. Then Mr. Coon climbed up on the Big Rock and with a stick
pounded for silence.

"I move," said he, "that in as much as we cannot agree, we tell
Great-Grandfather Frog all about the danger and ask his advice, for he
is very old and very wise and remembers when the world was young. All in
favor please raise their right hands."

At once the air was full of hands, and everybody was good-natured once
more. So it was agreed to call in Great-Grandfather Frog.



CHAPTER III: The Oracle Of The Smiling Pool

Grandfather Frog sat on his big green lily-pad with his eyes half
closed, for all the world as if he knew nothing about the meeting at the
Big Rock. Of course he did know, for there isn't much going on around
the Smiling Pool which he doesn't see or at least hear all about. The
Merry Little Breezes, who are here, there, and everywhere, told him
all that was going on, so that when he saw Jerry Muskrat and Little Joe
Otter swimming towards him, he knew what they were coming for. But he
pretended to be very much surprised when Jerry Muskrat very politely
said: "Good morning, Grandfather Frog."

"Good morning, Jerry Muskrat. You're out early this morning," replied
Grandfather Frog.

"If you please, you are wanted over at the Big Rock," said Jerry.

Grandfather Frog's eyes twinkled, but he made his voice very deep and
gruff as he replied: "Chugarum! You're a scamp, Jerry Muskrat, and
Little Joe Otter is another. What trick are you trying to play on me
now?"

Jerry Muskrat and Little Joe Otter looked a wee bit sheepish, for it was
true that they were forever trying to play tricks on Grandfather Frog.
"Really and truly, Grandfather Frog, there isn't any trick this time,"
said Jerry. "There is a meeting at the Big Rock to try to decide what to
do to keep Farmer Brown's boy from setting traps around the Smiling Pool
and along the Laughing Brook, and everybody wants your advice, because
you are so old and so wise. Please come."

Grandfather Frog smoothed down his white and yellow waistcoat and
pretended to think the matter over very seriously, while Jerry and
Little Joe fidgeted impatiently. Finally he spoke.

"I am very old, as you have said, Jerry Muskrat, and it is a long way
over to the Big Rock."

"Get right on my back and I'll take you over there," said Jerry eagerly.

"I'm afraid that you'll spill me off," replied Grandfather Frog.

"No, I won't; just try me and see," begged Jerry.

So Grandfather Frog climbed on Jerry Muskrat's back, and Jerry started
for the Big Rock as fast as he could go. When all the Minks and the
Otters and the Coons and the Muskrats saw them coming, they gave a
great shout, for Grandfather Frog is sometimes called the oracle of the
