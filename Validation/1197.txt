    Though no grace she boast,
  Though no gardener call her fair,
    I love Clover most.

  "Butterfly may pass her by,
    He is but a rover,
  I'm a faithful, loving Bee--
    And I stick to Clover."

This was the first valentine Clover had ever had. She was perfectly
enchanted.

"Oh, who _do_ you suppose sent it?" she cried.

But before anybody could answer, there came another loud knock at
the door, which made them all jump. Behold, Bridget again, with a
second letter!

"It's for you, Miss Elsie, this time," she said with a grin.

There was an instant rush from all the children, and the envelope was
torn open in the twinkling of an eye. Inside was a little ivory seal
with "Elsie" on it in old English letters, and these rhymes:

  "I know a little girl,
  She is very dear to me,
  She is just as sweet as honey
  When she chooses so to be,
  And her name begins with E, and ends with E.

  "She has brown hair which curls,
  And black eyes for to see
  With, teeth like tiny pearls,
  And dimples, one, two--three,
  And her name begins with E, and ends with E.

  "Her little feet run faster
  Than other feet can flee,
  As she brushes quickly past, her
  Voice hums like a bee,
  And her name begins with E, and ends with E.

  "Do you ask me why I love her?
  Then I shall answer thee,
  Because I can't help loving,
  She is so sweet to me,
  This little girl whose name begins and ends with 'E.'"

"It's just like a fairy story," said Elsie, whose eyes had grown as
big as saucers from surprise, while these verses were being read
aloud by Cecy.

Another knock. This time there was a perfect handful of letters.
Everybody had one. Katy, to her great surprise, had _two_.

"Why, what _can_ this be?" she said. But when she peeped into the second
one, she saw Cousin Helen's handwriting, and she put it into her pocket,
till the valentines should be read.

Dorry's was opened first. It had the picture of a pie at the
top--I ought to explain that Dorry had lately been having a siege
with the dentist.

  "Little Jack Horner
  Sat in his corner,
    Eating his Christmas pie,
  When a sudden grimace
  Spread over his face,
    And he began loudly to cry.

  "His tender Mamma
  Heard the sound from afar,
    And hastened to comfort her child;
  'What aileth my John?'
  She inquired in a tone
    Which belied her question mild.

  "'Oh, Mother,' he said,
  'Every tooth in my head
    Jumps and aches and is loose, O my!
   And it hurts me to eat
   Anything that is sweet--
     So what _will_ become of my pie?'

  "It were vain to describe
  How he roared and he cried,
    And howled like a miniature tempest;
  Suffice it to say,
  That the very next day
    He had all his teeth pulled by a dentist!"

This valentine made the children laugh for a long time. Johnnie's
envelope held a paper doll named "Red Riding-Hood." These were
the verses:

  "I send you my picture, dear Johnnie, to show
    That I'm just as alive as you,
  And that you needn't cry over my fate
    Any more, as you used to do.

  "The wolf didn't hurt me at all that day,
    For I kicked and fought and cried,
  Till he dropped me out of his mouth, and ran
    Away in the woods to hide.

  "And Grandma and I have lived ever since
    In the little brown house so small,
  And churned fresh butter and made cream cheeses,
    Nor seen the wolf at all.

  "So cry no more for fear I am eaten,
    The naughty wolf is shot,
  And if you will come to tea some evening
    You shall see for yourself I'm not."

Johnnie was immensely pleased at this, for Red Riding-Hood was a great
favorite of hers.

Philly had a bit of india-rubber in his letter, which was written with
very black ink on a big sheet of foolscap:

  "I was once a naughty man,
    And I hid beneath the bed,
  To steal your india-rubbers,
    But I chewed them up instead.

  "Then you called out, 'Who is there?'
    I was thrown most in a fit,
  And I let the india-rubbers fall--
    All but this little bit.

  "I'm sorry for my naughty ways,
    And now, to make amends,
  I send the chewed piece back again,
    And beg we may be friends.

                          "ROBBER."

"Just listen to mine," said Cecy, who had all along pretended to be as
much surprised as anybody, and now behaved as if she could hardly wait
till Philly's was finished. Then she read aloud:

"TO CECY.

  "If I were a bird
  And you were a bird,
  What would we do?
  Why you should be little and I would be big,
  And, side by side on a cherry-tree twig,
  We'd kiss with our yellow bills, and coo--
  That's what we'd do!

  "If I were a fish
  And you were a fish,
  What would we do?
  We'd frolic, and whisk our little tails,
  And play all sorts of tricks with the whales,
  And call on the oysters, and order a 'stew,'
  That's what we'd do!

  "If I were a bee
  And you were a bee,
  What would we do?
  We'd find a home in a breezy wood,
  And store it with honey sweet and good.
  You should feed me and I would feed you,
  That's what we'd do!

               "VALENTINE."

"I think that's the prettiest of all," said Clover.

"I don't," said Elsie. "I think mine is the prettiest. Cecy didn't have
any seal in hers, either." And she fondled the little seal, which all
this time she had held in her hand.

"Katy, you ought to have read yours first because you are the oldest,"
said Clover.

"Mine isn't much," replied Katy, and she read:

  "The rose is red the violet blue,
    Sugar is sweet, and so are you."

"What a mean valentine!" cried Elsie, with flashing eyes. "It's a real
shame, Katy! You ought to have had the best of all."

Katy could hardly keep from laughing. The fact was that the verses for
the others had taken so long, that no time had been left for writing a
valentine to herself. So, thinking it would excite suspicion to have
none, she had scribbled this old rhyme at the last moment.

"It isn't very nice," she said, trying to look as pensive as she could,
"but never mind."

"It's a shame!" repeated Elsie, petting her very hard to make up for the
injustice.

"Hasn't it been a funny evening?" said John; and Dorry replied, "Yes; we
never had such good times before Katy was sick, did we?"

Katy heard this with a mingled feeling of pleasure and pain. "I think
the children do love me a little more of late," she said to herself.
"But, oh, why couldn't I be good to them when I was well and strong!"

She didn't open Cousin Helen's letter until the rest were all gone to
bed. I think somebody must have written and told about the valentine
party, for instead of a note there were these verses in Cousin Helen's
own clear, pretty hand. It wasn't a valentine, because it was too
solemn, as Katy explained to Clover, next day. "But," she added, "it is
a great deal beautifuller than any valentine that ever was written." And
Clover thought so too.

These were the verses:

  "IN SCHOOL.

  "I used to go to a bright school
  Where Youth and Frolic taught in turn;
  But idle scholar that I was,
  I liked to play, I would not learn;
  So the Great Teacher did ordain
  That I should try the School of Pain.

  "One of the infant class I am
  With little, easy lessons, set
  In a great book; the higher class
  Have harder ones than I, and yet
  I find mine hard, and can't restrain
  My tears while studying thus with Pain.

  "There are two Teachers in the school,
  One has a gentle voice and low,
  And smiles upon her scholars, as
  She softly passes to and fro.
  Her name is Love; 'tis very plain
  She shuns the sharper teacher, Pain.

  "Or so I sometimes think; and then,
  At other times, they meet and kiss,
  And look so strangely like, that I
  Am puzzled to tell how it is,
  Or whence the change which makes it vain
  To guess if it be--Love or Pain.

  "They tell me if I study well,
  And learn my lessons, I shall be
  Moved upward to that higher class
  Where dear Love teaches constantly;
  And I work hard, in hopes to gain
  Reward, and get away from Pain.

  "Yet Pain is sometimes kind, and helps
  Me on when I am very dull;
  I thank him often in my heart;
  But Love is far more beautiful;
  Under her tender, gentle reign
  I must learn faster than of Pain.

  "So I will do my very best,
  Nor chide the clock, nor call it slow;
  That when the Teacher calls me up
  To see if I am fit to go,
  I may to Love's high class attain,
  And bid a sweet good-by to Pain."




CHAPTER XI

A NEW LESSON TO LEARN


It was a long time before the children ceased to talk and laugh over
that jolly evening. Dorry declared he wished there could be a
Valentine's-Day every week.

"Don't you think St. Valentine would be tired of writing verses?" asked
Katy. But she, too, had enjoyed the frolic, and the bright recollection
helped her along through the rest of the long, cold winter.

Spring opened late that year, but the Summer, when it came, was a warm
one. Katy felt the heat very much. She could not change her seat and
follow the breeze about from window to window as other people could. The
long burning days left her weak and parched. She hung her head, and
seemed to wilt like the flowers in the garden-beds. Indeed she was worse
off than they, for every evening Alexander gave them a watering with the
hose, while nobody was able to bring a watering-pot and pour out what
she needed--a shower of cold, fresh air.

It wasn't easy to be good-humored under these circumstances, and one
could hardly have blamed Katy if she had sometimes forgotten her
resolutions and been cross and fretful. But she didn't--not very often.
Now and then bad days came, when she was discouraged and forlorn. But
Katy's long year of schooling had taught her self-control, and, as a
general thing, her discomforts were borne patiently. She could not help
growing pale and thin however, and Papa saw with concern that, as the
summer went on, she became too languid to read, or study, or sew, and
just sat hour after hour, with folded hands, gazing wistfully out of
the window.

He tried the experiment of taking her to drive. But the motion of the
