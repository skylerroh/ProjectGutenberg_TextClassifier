The almost general desire to have THE OWL
and THE PUSSY-CAT, THE DUCK and THE
KANGAROO, in a distinct form from Mr. LEAR's
other Nonsense Drolleries, has induced us to
issue them separately with Original Illustrations.

[Illustration]

    The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea
        In a beautiful pea-green boat,

    They took some honey, and plenty of money
        Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
