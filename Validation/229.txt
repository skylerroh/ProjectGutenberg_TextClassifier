There was a general murmur indicating approval of this sentiment, and
several "that's sos" were heard, but Israel said, as he patted Hubbard
paternally on the back:

"Let bygones be bygones, Paul. Them things be all over naow, an I
callate thar won't be no more busin of poor folks. The lyin an the
lamb be a gonter lie down together arter this, 'cordin tew scripter. I
declar, it seems jiss like the good ole times 'long from '74 to '80,
wen thar warn't no courts in Berkshire. Wen I wuz a tellin ye baout them
times 'tother night, I swow I didn't callate ye'd ever have a chance to
see em fer yerselves, leastways, not till ye got ter Heavin, an I guess
that's a slim chance with most on ye. Jess think on't, boys. Thar ain't
been nary sheriff's sale, nor a man tuk ter jail this hull week."

"Iry Seymour wuz a gonter sell aout Elnathan Hamlin this week, but
somehow he hain't got tew it," said Abner, dryly. "I callate he heard
some news from Barrington baout Tuesday."

"Iry mout's well give up his comishin ez depity sheriff an try ter git
inter some honest trade," remarked Israel.

"Whar does Squire Woodbridge keep hisself these days? I hain't seen him
skurcely this week," said Ezra Phelps.

"Yew don' genally see much of a rooster the week arter another rooster's
gin him a darnation lickin on his own dung hill, an that's wat's the
matter with Squire," replied Abner. Shifting his quid of tobacco to the
other side of the mouth and expectorating across half the room into the
chimney place he continued, reflectively:

"By gosh, I don' blame him, nuther. It muss come kinder tough fer a
feller ez hez lorded it over Stockbridge fer nigh twenty year tew git
put daown afore the hull village the way Perez put him daown Tuesday. Ef
I wuz Squire, I shouldn't never wan ter show myself agin roun' here."

"I be kinder sorry fer him," said Israel Goodrich. "I declar for't if I
ain't. It muss be kinder tough tew git took daown so, specially fer sech
a dreffle proud man."

"I hain't sot eyes on him on'y once sence Tewsday," said Peleg. "He
looked right straight through me 'z ef he didn' see nothin. He didn'
seem ter notice nobody ez he went along the street."

"By gosh, he'd notice ye quick nuff ef he could put ye in the stocks,"
observed Abner, grimly. "I tell yew he ain't furgut one on us that
went daown ter Barrington, nor one on us ez wuz a serenadin him t'other
night. Yew jess let Squire git his grip onto this ere taown agin ez he
uster hev it an the constable an the whippin post won't hev no rest till
he's paid orf his grudge agin' every one on us. An ef yew dunno that,
yew dunno Squire Woodbridge."

The silence which followed indicated that the hearers did know the
Squire well enough to appreciate the force of Abner's remarks, and
that the contingencies which they suggested were inducive of serious
reflections. It was Jabez Flint, the Tory, who effected a diversion by
observing dryly,

"Yes, ef Squire gits his grip agin, some on us will git darnation sore
backs, but he's lost it, an he ain't a gonter git it agin ez long ez we
fellers keeps ourn. On'y 'twont dew ter hev no foolin, tain't no child's
play we're at."

"I know one thing dum well" said Obadiah Weeks, "and that is I wouldn'
like tew be in Cap'n Hamlin's shoes ef Squire sh'd git top agin.
Jehosaphat, though, wouldn' he jess go fer the Cap'n. I guess he'd give
him ten lashes ev'ry day fer a month an make him set in the stocks with
pepper 'n salt rubbed in his back 'tween times, an then hev him hung ter
wind up with, an he wouldn' be half sassified then."

"Warn't that the gol-darndest though, baout that Edwards gal agoin tew
ass Perez to git the mewsic stopped? By gosh, I can't git over that,"
exclaimed Peleg, grinning from ear to ear. "I was a lyin awake las'
night and I got ter thinkin bout it, an I begun snickering so's She
waked up, and She says, 'Peleg,' seshee 'what in time be yew a snickerin
at?' and I says I wuz a snickerin tew think o' that air stuck up leetle
gal o' Squire Edwards daown on her knees tew Perez, a cryin an a assin
him ef he wouldn' please hev the racket stopped. Yew sed she wuz ontew
her knees, didn't yew, Obadiah?"

"Tell us all about it Obadiah, we wanter hear it agin," was the general
demand.

"Ye see the way on't wuz this," said Obadiah, nothing loath. "She come
in all a cryin an scairt like, and Perez he wuz thar an so wuz the res'
o' the family, an the fuss thing she does, she gits down on the floor
intew the sand with a new silk gown she hed on, and asses Perez to hev
the hoss-fiddles stopped. An he said t'er fuss, as haow he wouldn't,
said 'twas good nuff fur the silk stockings, and he pinted ter Reub an
says for her tew see what they'd done ter his family. But she cried
an tuck on, an says ez haow she wouldn't git up 'nless he'd stop the
hoss-fiddles, an so he hed tew give in, an that's all I knows about it."

"Ye see Obadiah knows all baout it," said Abner. "He keeps kumpny with
the Fennell gal, as is tew the Hamlins. He got it straight's a string,
didn't ye, Obadiah?"

"Yes," said Obadiah, "it's all jess so. Thar ain't no mistake."

No incident of the insurrection had taken such hold on the popular
imagination as the appeal of Desire Edwards to Perez for protection.
It was immensely flattering to the vanity of the mob, as typifying the
state of terror to which the aristocrats had been reduced, and all the
louts in town felt an inch the taller, by reason of it, and walked with
an additional swagger. The demand for the details of the scene between
Perez and Desire was insatiable and Obadiah was called on twenty times
a day to relate to gaping, grinning audiences just how she looked, what
she did, and said, and what Perez said. The fact that Obadiah's positive
information on the subject was limited to a few words that Prudence had
dropped, made it necessary for him to depend largely on his imagination
to satisfy the demands of his auditors, which accounts for the slight
discrepancy between the actual facts as known to the reader and the
popular version. After everybody had haw hawed and cracked his joke over
Obadiah's last repetition of the anecdote, Peleg observed:

"I dunno's az a feller kin blame Perez fer givin intew her. The gal's
derned hansum, though she be mos' too black complected."

"She ain't none tew black, not to my thinkin," said Widow Bingham,
looking up from her knitting as she sat behind the bar,--the widow
herself was a buxom brunette--"but I never did see anybuddy kerry ther
nose quite so high in all my born days. She don't pay no more 'tension
to common folks 'n if they wuz dirt under her feet."

"Whar's Meshech Little, ter night?" inquired Israel Goodrich, not so
much interested as the younger men in the points of young women.

"He's been drunk all day," said Obadiah, who always knew everything that
was going on.

"Whar'd he git the money?" asked some one.

"Meshech don' need no money tew git drunk," said Abner. "He's got a
thirst ontew him as'll draw liquor aout a cask a rod orf, an the bung
in, jess like the clouds draws water on a hot day. He don' need no
money, Meshech don' tew git soaked."

"He hed some, he hed a shillin howsumever," said Obadiah. "Deacon Nash
give it tew him fer pitchin rowen."

"I hain't been so tickled in ten year," said Israel, "ez I wuz wen
Deacon come roun tidday a offerin a shillin lawful tew the fellers tew
git in his rowen fer him. It must hev been like pullin teeth fer Deacon
tew pay aout cash fer work seein ez he's made his debtors dew all his
farmin fer him this five year, but he hed tew come tew 't, fer his rowen
wuz a spilin, an nary one o' his debtors would lif a finger 'thout bein
paid for 't."

"That air shillin o' Meshech's is the fuss money o' his'n I've seen
fer flip in more'n a year," said Widow Bingham, "an thar be them, not a
thousan mile from here, nuther, ez I could say the same on, more shame
to em, for't, an I a lone widder."

The line of remark adopted by the widow, appeared to exert a depressing
influence on the spirits of the company, and this, together with the
information volunteered by Obadiah, that it was "arter nine," presently
caused a general break-up.




CHAPTER FOURTEENTH

PEREZ GOES TO MEETING


The very next day, as Squire Edwards and his family were sitting down to
dinner, the eldest son Jonathan, a fine young fellow of sixteen, came in
late with a blacked eye and torn clothes.

"My son," said Squire Edwards, sternly, "why do you come to the table in
such a condition? What have you been doing?"

"I've been fighting Obadiah Weeks, sir, and I whipped him, too."

"And I shall whip you, sir, and soundly," said his father, with the
Jove-like frown of the eighteenth century parent. "What have I told you
about fighting? Go to your room, and wait for me there. You will have no
dinner."

The boy turned on his heel without a word, and went out and up to his
room. In the course of the afternoon, Squire Edwards was as good as his
word. When he had come downstairs, after the discharge of his parental
responsibilities, and gone into the store, Desire slipped up to
Jonathan's room with a substantial luncheon under her apron. He was her
favorite brother, and it was her habit thus surreptitiously to
temper justice with mercy on occasions like the present. The lively
satisfaction with which the youth hailed her appearance, gave ground to
the suspicion that an empty stomach had been causing him more discomfort
than a reproving conscience. As Desire was arranging the viands on the
table she expressed a hope that the paternal correction had not been
more painful than usual. The boy began to grin.

"Don't you fret about father's lickins," he said, "I'd just as lieve
he'd lick me all day if he'll give me a couple o' minutes to get ready
in. How many pair o' trowsers do you s'pose I've got on?"

"One, of course."

"Four," replied Jonathan, laying one forefinger by the side of his nose
and winking at his sister. "I was sort of sorry for father, he got so
tuckered trying to make me cry. Jimmeny, though, that veal pie looks
good. I should hated to have lost that. You was real good to fetch it
up.

"T'was only fair, though, this time," he continued, with his mouth full,
"for t'was on 'count o' you I got to fightin."

"What do you mean?" said she.

"Why, Obadiah's been tellin the biggest set o' lies about you I ever
heard of. He's been tellin em all over town. He said you went over to
Elnathan Hamlin's, Wednesday, and got down on your knees to that Cap'n
Hamlin, so's to get him not to have no more o' those horse-fiddles in
front of Uncle's and our houses. You better believe I walloped him well,
if he is bigger than me."

Jonathan, busy with eating, had not observed his sister's face during
this recital, but now he said, glancing up:

"What on earth do you s'pose put such a lie into his head?"

"It isn't all a lie, Jonathan."

The boy laid down his knife and fork, and stared at her aghast.

"You don't mean you was over there?" he exclaimed.

Desire's face was crimson to the roots of her hair. She bowed her head.

"Wh-a-a-t!" said Jonathan, in a tone of utter disgust, tempered only by
a remnant of incredulity.

"I didn't go on my knees to him," said Desire faintly.

"Oh, you didn't, didn't you? I believe you did," said the boy slowly,
with an accent of ineffable scorn, rising to his feet and drawing away
from his sister, as she seemed about to approach him.

Before the lad of sixteen, his elder sister, who had carried him in her
arms as a baby, and been his teacher as a boy, stood like a culprit,
quite abject. Finally she said:

"I didn't do it for myself. I did it for Aunt Lucy. The doctor said it
would kill her if she was kept awake another night, and there was no
other way to stop the mob. And so I did it."

"Was that the way?" said the boy, evidently staggered by this unexpected
plea, and seeming quite at loss what to say.

"Yes," said Desire, rallying a little. "You might know it was. Do you
think I'd do it any other way? I couldn't see Aunty die, could I?"

"No-o, darn it. I s'pose not," replied Jonathan slowly, as if he were
not quite sure. His face wore a puzzled expression, the problem offered
by this conflict of ethical obligations with caste sentiment being
evidently too much for his boyish intellect. Evidently he had not
inherited his grandfather's metaphysical faculty. Finally, with an air
of being entirely posed, and losing interest in the subject, he sat down
on the edge of his bed and abruptly closed the interview by observing:

"I'm going to take off some of these trowsers. They're too hot." Desire
discreetly went out.

The only point in the observance of Sunday by the forefathers of New
England, which is still generally practiced in these degenerate
days, namely, the duty of sleeping later than usual that morning, was
transgressed in at least one Stockbridge household on the Lord's Day
following. Captain Perez Hamlin was up betimes and busy about house and
barns. Since he had returned home he had taken the responsibility of all
the chores about the place from the enfeebled shoulders of his father,
besides supplying the place of man nurse to the invalids. This morning
he had risen earlier than usual because he wanted to do up all the work
before time for meeting.

It would have been easy for any one whose eye had followed him at his
work, to see that his mind was preoccupied. Now he would walk about
briskly, with head in the air, whistling as he went, or talking to
the horse and cow, and anon bursting out laughing at his own
absent-mindedness, as he found he had given the horse the cow's food, or
put the meal into the water bucket. And again you would have certainly
thought that he was fishing for the frogs at the bottom of the well
instead of drawing water, so long did he stand leaning over the
well-curb, before he bethought himself to loose his hold on the rope and
let the ponderous well-sweep bring up the bucket.

He had not seen Desire Edwards since the Wednesday afternoon when she
had called, but he knew he should see her at meeting. It was she who
was responsible for the daydreaming way in which he was going about this
morning, and for a good deal of previous daydreaming and night dreaming,
too, in the last few days. The analogy of the tender passion to
the chills and fever, had been borne out in his case by the usual
alternations of complacency and depression. He told himself, that since
he remembered so well his boyish courtship of her, she, too, doubtless
remembered it. A woman was even more likely than a man to remember such
things. Doubtless, she remembered too, that kiss she had given him.
Her coming to him to ask his protection for her aunt, if she remembered
those passages had some significance. She must have known that he
would also remember them, and surely that would have deterred her from
reopening their acquaintance had she found the reminiscences in question
disagreeable. He assured himself that had it been wholly unpleasant for
her to meet him, she would have been shrewd enough to devise some other
way of securing the purpose of her visit. She had remained unmarried
all the time of his absence, although she must have had suitors.
Perhaps--well if this conjecture sounded a little conceited, be sure it
was alternated with others self-depreciatory enough to balance it. But I
have no space or need to describe the familiar process of architecture,
by which with a perhaps for a keystone, possibilities for pillars,
and dreams for pinnacles, lovers are wont to rear in a few idle hours,
palaces outdazzling Aladdin's. I shall more profitably give a word
or two of explanation to another point. Those familiar with the
aristocratic constitution of New England society at this period, will
perhaps deem it strange that the social gulf between the poor farmer's
son, like Perez, and the daughter of one of the most distinguished
families in Berkshire, should not have sufficed to deter the young man
from indulging aspirations in that direction.

Perhaps, if he had grown up at home, such might have been the case,
despite his boyish fondness for the girl. But the army of the revolution
had been for its officers and more intelligent element, a famous school
of democratic ideas. Perez was only one of thousands, who came home
deeply imbued with principles of social equality; principles, which,
despite finely phrased manifestoes and declarations of independence,
were destined to work like a slow leaven for generations yet, ere
they transformed the oligarchical system of colonial society, into
the democracy of our day. It is true that, Paul Hubbard, Abner, Peleg,
Meshech, and the rest, had been like Perez in the army, and yet the
democratic impressions they had there received, now that they had
returned home, served only to exasperate them against the pretensions of
the superior class, without availing to eradicate their inbred instincts
of servility in the presence of the very men they hated. Precisely this
self-contemptuous recognition of his own servile feeling, operating on
a morose temper, was the key to Hubbard's special bitterness toward the
silk stockings. That Perez had none of this peasant's instinct, must,
after all, be partly ascribed to the fact that his descent, by his
mother's side, had been a gentleman's, and as Reuben had taken after
Elnathan, so Perez was his mother's boy. He felt himself a gentleman,
although a farmer's son. The air of dainty remoteness and distinction,
which invested Desire in his imagination, was by virtue of her
womanhood, solely, not as the representative of a higher class. He was
penniless, she was rich, but to that sufficiently discouraging obstacle,
no paralyzing sense of caste inferiority was added, in his mind.

Despite the dilatory and absent-minded procedure of the young man, by
the time Prudence came out to call him in to the breakfast of fried pork
and johnny-cake, the chores were done, and afterwards he had only to
concern himself with his toilet. He stood a long time gazing ruefully
at his coat, so sadly threadbare and white in the seams. It was his only
one, and very old, but Prudence thought, when with a sigh he finally
drew it on, that she had never seen so fine a soldier, and, indeed, the
coat did look much better on than off, for a gallant bearing will, to
some extent, redeem the most dilapidated attire.

Reuben had grown stronger from day to day, and though still weak, it was
thought that he could well enough take care of George Fennell, during
the forenoon, and allow the rest of the family to go to meeting. Perez
had tinkered up the old cart, and contrived a harness out of ropes, by
which his own horse could be attached to it, the farm horse having been
long since sold off, and Mrs. Hamlin, who by reason of infirmities, had
long been debarred from the privileges of the sanctuary, expected to be
able by this means, to be present there this morning, to offer up
devout thanksgiving for the mercy which had so wonderfully, in one week,
restored her two sons to her.

It was half-past nine when the air was filled with a deep musical,
melancholy sound, which appeared to come from the hill north of the
village, where the meeting-house stood. It lasted, perhaps, five
seconds, beginning with a long crescendo, and quivering into silence by
an equally prolonged diminuendo. It was certainly an astonishing sound
but none of the family appeared in the least agitated, Elnathan merely
remarking:

"Thar's the warnin blow, Perez, I guess ye better be thinkin baout
hitchin up." It were a pity indeed if the people of Stockbridge had
not by that time become familiar with the sound of the old Indian
conch-shell which since the mission church was founded at the first
settlement of the town had served instead of a meeting-house bell.
It may be well believed that strong lungs were the first requisite in
sextons of that day. When an hour later the same dreary wail filled the
valley once more with its weird echoes, the family was on its way to
meeting, Mrs. Hamlin and Elnathan in the cart, and Perez with Prudence
