I. AN AMBUSCADE

Early in the year VIII., at the beginning of Vendemiaire, or, to conform
to our own calendar, towards the close of September, 1799, a hundred or
so of peasants and a large number of citizens, who had left Fougeres in
the morning on their way to Mayenne, were going up the little mountain
of La Pelerine, half-way between Fougeres and Ernee, a small town where
travellers along that road are in the habit of resting. This company,
divided into groups that were more or less numerous, presented a
collection of such fantastic costumes and a mixture of individuals
belonging to so many and diverse localities and professions that it will
be well to describe their characteristic differences, in order to give
to this history the vivid local coloring to which so much value is
attached in these days,--though some critics do assert that it injures
the representation of sentiments.

Many of the peasants, in fact the greater number, were barefooted, and
wore no other garments than a large goatskin, which covered them from
the neck to the knees, and trousers of white and very coarse linen, the
ill-woven texture of which betrayed the slovenly industrial habits of
the region. The straight locks of their long hair mingling with those
of the goatskin hid their faces, which were bent on the ground, so
completely that the garment might have been thought their own skin,
and they themselves mistaken at first sight for a species of the animal
which served them as clothing. But through this tangle of hair their
eyes were presently seen to shine like dew-drops in a thicket, and their
glances, full of human intelligence, caused fear rather than pleasure to
those who met them. Their heads were covered with a dirty head-gear of
red flannel, not unlike the Phrygian cap which the Republic had lately
adopted as an emblem of liberty. Each man carried over his shoulder a
heavy stick of knotted oak, at the end of which hung a linen bag with
little in it. Some wore, over the red cap, a coarse felt hat, with a
broad brim adorned by a sort of woollen chenille of many colors which
was fastened round it. Others were clothed entirely in the coarse linen
of which the trousers and wallets of all were made, and showed nothing
that was distinctive of the new order of civilization. Their long
hair fell upon the collar of a round jacket with square pockets, which
reached to the hips only, a garment peculiar to the peasantry of western
France. Beneath this jacket, which was worn open, a waistcoat of the
same linen with large buttons was visible. Some of the company marched
in wooden shoes; others, by way of economy, carried them in their hand.
This costume, soiled by long usage, blackened with sweat and dust, and
less original than that of the other men, had the historic merit of
serving as a transition between the goatskins and the brilliant, almost
sumptuous, dress of a few individuals dispersed here and there among the
groups, where they shone like flowers. In fact, the blue linen trousers
of these last, and their red or yellow waistcoats, adorned with two
parallel rows of brass buttons and not unlike breast-plates, stood out
as vividly among the white linen and shaggy skins of their companions as
the corn-flowers and poppies in a wheat-field. Some of them wore wooden
shoes, which the peasants of Brittany make for themselves; but the
greater number had heavy hobnailed boots, and coats of coarse cloth cut
in the fashion of the old regime, the shape of which the peasants have
religiously retained even to the present day. The collars of their
shirts were held together by buttons in the shape of hearts or anchors.
The wallets of these men seemed to be better than those of their
companions, and several of them added to their marching outfit a flask,
probably full of brandy, slung round their necks by a bit of twine. A
few burgesses were to be seen in the midst of these semi-savages, as if
to show the extremes of civilization in this region. Wearing round hats,
or flapping brims or caps, high-topped boots, or shoes and gaiters, they
exhibited as many and as remarkable differences in their costume as the
peasants themselves. About a dozen of them wore the republican jacket
known by the name of "la carmagnole." Others, well-to-do mechanics, no
doubt, were clothed from head to foot in one color. Those who had most
pretension to their dress wore swallow-tail coats or surtouts of blue
or green cloth, more or less defaced. These last, evidently characters,
marched in boots of various kinds, swinging heavy canes with the air and
manner of those who take heart under misfortune. A few heads carefully
powdered, and some queues tolerably well braided showed the sort of
care which a beginning of education or prosperity inspires. A casual
spectator observing these men, all surprised to find themselves in one
another's company, would have thought them the inhabitants of a village
driven out by a conflagration. But the period and the region in which
they were gave an altogether different interest to this body of men.
Any one initiated into the secrets of the civil discords which were then
agitating the whole of France could easily have distinguished the few
individuals on whose fidelity the Republic might count among these
groups, almost entirely made up of men who four years earlier were at
war with her.

One other and rather noticeable sign left no doubt upon the opinions
which divided the detachment. The Republicans alone marched with an air
of gaiety. As to the other individuals of the troop, if their clothes
showed marked differences, their faces at least and their attitudes wore
a uniform expression of ill-fortune. Citizens and peasantry, their faces
all bore the imprint of deepest melancholy; their silence had something
sullen in it; they all seemed crushed under the yoke of a single
thought, terrible no doubt but carefully concealed, for their faces were
impenetrable, the slowness of their gait alone betraying their inward
communings. From time to time a few of them, noticeable for the rosaries
hanging from their necks (dangerous as it was to carry that sign of a
religion which was suppressed, rather than abolished) shook their long
hair and raised their heads defiantly. They covertly examined the woods,
and paths, and masses of rock which flanked the road, after the manner
of a dog with his nose to the wind trying to scent his game; and then,
hearing nothing but the monotonous tramp of the silent company, they
lowered their heads once more with the old expression of despair, like
criminals on their way to the galleys to live or die.

The march of this column upon Mayenne, the heterogeneous elements
of which it was composed, and the divers sentiments which evidently
pervaded it, will explain the presence of another troop which formed the
head of the detachment. About a hundred and fifty soldiers, with arms
and baggage, marched in the advance, commanded by the _chief of a
half-brigade_. We may mention here, for the benefit of those who did
not witness the drama of the Revolution, that this title was made to
supersede that of colonel, proscribed by patriots as too aristocratic.
These soldiers belonged to a demi-brigade of infantry quartered at
Mayenne. During these troublous times the inhabitants of the west of
France called all the soldiers of the Republic "Blues." This nickname
came originally from their blue and red uniforms, the memory of which is
still so fresh as to render a description superfluous. A detachment of
the Blues was therefore on this occasion escorting a body of recruits,
or rather conscripts, all displeased at being taken to Mayenne where
military discipline was about to force upon them the uniformity of
thought, clothing, and gait which they now lacked entirely.

This column was a contingent slowly and with difficulty raised in the
district of Fougeres, from which it was due under the levy ordered by
the executive Directory of the Republic on the preceding 10th Messidor.
The government had asked for a hundred million of francs and a hundred
thousand men as immediate reinforcements for the armies then fighting
the Austrians in Italy, the Prussians in Germany, and menaced in
Switzerland by the Russians, in whom Suwarow had inspired hopes of the
conquest of France. The departments of the West, known under the name
of La Vendee, Brittany, and a portion of Lower Normandy, which had
been tranquil for the last three years (thanks to the action of General
Hoche), after a struggle lasting nearly four, seemed to have seized this
new occasion of danger to the nation to break out again. In presence of
such aggressions the Republic recovered its pristine energy. It provided
in the first place for the defence of the threatened departments by
giving the responsibility to the loyal and patriotic portion of the
inhabitants. In fact, the government in Paris, having neither troops nor
money to send to the interior, evaded the difficulty by a parliamentary
gasconade. Not being able to send material aid to the faithful citizens
of the insurgent departments, it gave them its "confidence." Possibly
the government hoped that this measure, by arming the insurgents against
each other, would stifle the insurrection at its birth. This ordinance,
the cause of future fatal reprisals, was thus worded: "Independent
companies of troops shall be organized in the Western departments." This
impolitic step drove the West as a body into so hostile an attitude that
the Directory despaired of immediately subduing it. Consequently, it
asked the Assemblies to pass certain special measures relating to the
independent companies authorized by the ordinance. In response to this
request a new law had been promulgated a few days before this history
begins, organizing into regular legions the various weak and
scattered companies. These legions were to bear the names of the
departments,--Sarthe, Orne, Mayenne, Ille-et-Vilaine, Morbihan,
Loire-Inferieure, and Maine-et-Loire. "These legions," said the law,
"will be specially employed to fight the Chouans, and cannot, under any
pretence, be sent to the frontier."

The foregoing irksome details will explain both the weakness of the
Directory and the movement of this troop of men under escort of the
Blues. It may not be superfluous to add that these finely patriotic
Directorial decrees had no realization beyond their insertion among the
statutes. No longer restrained, as formerly, by great moral ideas, by
patriotism, nor by terror, which enforced their execution, these later
decrees of the Republic created millions and drafted soldiers without
the slightest benefit accruing to its exchequer or its armies. The
mainspring of the Revolution was worn-out by clumsy handling, and the
application of the laws took the impress of circumstances instead of
controlling them.

The departments of Mayenne and Ille-et-Vilaine were at this time under
the command of an old officer who, judging on the spot of the measures
that were most opportune to take, was anxious to wring from Brittany
every one of her contingents, more especially that of Fougeres, which
was known to be a hot-bed of "Chouannerie." He hoped by this means to
weaken its strength in these formidable districts. This devoted soldier
made use of the illusory provisions of the new law to declare that he
would equip and arm at once all recruits, and he announced that he
held at their disposal the one month's advanced pay promised by the
government to these exceptional levies. Though Brittany had hitherto
refused all kinds of military service under the Republic, the levies
were made under the new law on the faith of its promises, and with such
promptness that even the commander was startled. But he was one of those
wary old watch-dogs who are hard to catch napping. He no sooner saw the
contingents arriving one after the other than he suspected some secret
motive for such prompt action. Possibly he was right in ascribing it
to the fact of getting arms. At any rate, no sooner were the Fougeres
recruits obtained than, without delaying for laggards, he took
immediate steps to fall back towards Alencon, so as to be near a loyal
neighborhood,--though the growing disaffection along the route made
the success of this measure problematical. This old officer, who, under
instruction of his superiors, kept secret the disasters of our armies in
Italy and Germany and the disturbing news from La Vendee, was attempting
on the morning when this history begins, to make a forced march on
Mayenne, where he was resolved to execute the law according to his own
good pleasure, and fill the half-empty companies of his own brigade
with his Breton conscripts. The word "conscript" which later became
so celebrated, had just now for the first time taken the place in the
government decrees of the word _requisitionnaire_ hitherto applied to
all Republican recruits.

Before leaving Fougeres the chief secretly issued to his own men ample
supplies of ammunition and sufficient rations of bread for the whole
detachment, so as to conceal from the conscripts the length of the march
before them. He intended not to stop at Ernee (the last stage
before Mayenne), where the men of the contingent might find a way of
communicating with the Chouans who were no doubt hanging on his flanks.
The dead silence which reigned among the recruits, surprised at the
manoeuvring of the old republican, and their lagging march up the
mountain excited to the very utmost the distrust and watchfulness of the
chief--whose name was Hulot. All the striking points in the foregoing
description had been to him matters of the keenest interest; he marched
in silence, surrounded by five young officers, each of whom respected
the evident preoccupation of their leader. But just as Hulot reached the
summit of La Pelerine he turned his head, as if by instinct, to inspect
the anxious faces of the recruits, and suddenly broke silence. The slow
advance of the Bretons had put a distance of three or four hundred feet
between themselves and their escort. Hulot's face contorted after a
fashion peculiar to himself.

"What the devil are those dandies up to?" he exclaimed in a sonorous
voice. "Creeping instead of marching, I call it."

At his first words the officers who accompanied him turned
spasmodically, as if startled out of sleep by a sudden noise. The
sergeants and corporals followed their example, and the whole company
paused in its march without receiving the wished for "Halt!" Though the
officers cast a first look at the detachment, which was creeping like an
elongated tortoise up the mountain of La Pelerine, these young men,
all dragged, like many others, from important studies to defend their
country, and in whom war had not yet smothered the sentiment of art,
were so much struck by the scene which lay spread before their eyes that
they made no answer to their chief's remark, the real significance of
which was unknown to them. Though they had come from Fougeres, where the
scene which now presented itself to their eyes is also visible (but with
certain differences caused by the change of perspective), they could not
resist pausing to admire it again, like those dilettanti who enjoy all
music the more when familiar with its construction.

From the summit of La Pelerine the traveller's eye can range over the
great valley of Couesnon, at one of the farthest points of which, along
the horizon, lay the town of Fougeres. From here the officers could see,
to its full extent, the basin of this intervale, as remarkable for the
fertility of its soil as for the variety of its aspects. Mountains of
gneiss and slate rose on all sides, like an ampitheatre, hiding their
ruddy flanks behind forests of oak, and forming on their declivities
other and lesser valleys full of dewy freshness. These rocky heights
made a vast enclosure, circular in form, in the centre of which a meadow
lay softly stretched, like the lawn of an English garden. A number
of evergreen hedges, defining irregular pieces of property which were
planted with trees, gave to this carpet of verdure a character of its
own, and one that is somewhat unusual among the landscapes of France; it
held the teeming secrets of many beauties in its various contrasts,
the effects of which were fine enough to arrest the eye of the most
indifferent spectator.

At this particular moment the scene was brightened by the fleeting glow
with which Nature delights at times in heightening the beauty of her
imperishable creations. While the detachment was crossing the valley,
the rising sun had slowly scattered the fleecy mists which float above
the meadows of a September morning. As the soldiers turned to look back,
an invisible hand seemed to lift from the landscape the last of these
veils--a delicate vapor, like a diaphanous gauze through which the glow
of precious jewels excites our curiosity. Not a cloud could be seen on
the wide horizon to mark by its silvery whiteness that the vast blue
arch was the firmament; it seemed, on the contrary, a dais of silk,
held up by the summits of the mountains and placed in the atmosphere, to
protect that beautiful assemblage of fields and meadows and groves and
brooks.

The group of young officers paused to examine a scene so filled with
natural beauties. The eyes of some roved among the copses, which the
sterner tints of autumn were already enriching with their russet tones,
contrasting the more with the emerald-green of the meadows in which
they grew; others took note of a different contrast, made by the ruddy
fields, where the buckwheat had been cut and tied in sheaves (like
stands of arms around a bivouac), adjoining other fields of rich
ploughed land, from which the rye was already harvested. Here and there
were dark slate roofs above which puffs of white smoke were rising. The
glittering silver threads of the winding brooks caught the eye, here and
there, by one of those optic lures which render the soul--one knows not
how or why--perplexed and dreamy. The fragrant freshness of the autumn
breeze, the stronger odors of the forest, rose like a waft of incense to
the admirers of this beautiful region, who noticed with delight its
rare wild-flowers, its vigorous vegetation, and its verdure, worthy of
England, the very word being common to the two languages. A few cattle
gave life to the scene, already so dramatic. The birds sang, filling the
valley with a sweet, vague melody that quivered in the air. If a quiet
imagination will picture to itself these rich fluctuations of light
and shade, the vaporous outline of the mountains, the mysterious
perspectives which were seen where the trees gave an opening, or
the streamlets ran, or some coquettish little glade fled away in the
distance; if memory will color, as it were, this sketch, as fleeting as
the moment when it was taken, the persons for whom such pictures are
not without charm will have an imperfect image of the magic scene which
delighted the still impressionable souls of the young officers.

Thinking that the poor recruits must be leaving, with regret, their own
country and their beloved customs, to die, perhaps, in foreign lands,
they involuntarily excused a tardiness their feelings comprehended.
Then, with the generosity natural to soldiers, they disguised their
indulgence under an apparent desire to examine into the military
position of the land. But Hulot, whom we shall henceforth call the
commandant, to avoid giving him the inharmonious title of "chief of a
half-brigade" was one of those soldiers who, in critical moments,
cannot be caught by the charms of a landscape, were they even those of
a terrestrial paradise. He shook his head with an impatient gesture and
contracted the thick, black eyebrows which gave so stern an expression
to his face.

"Why the devil don't they come up?" he said, for the second time, in a
hoarse voice, roughened by the toils of war.

"You ask why?" replied a voice.

Hearing these words, which seemed to issue from a horn, such as the
peasants of the western valleys use to call their flocks, the commandant
turned sharply round, as if pricked by a sword, and beheld, close behind
him, a personage even more fantastic in appearance than any of those who
were now being escorted to Mayenne to serve the Republic. This unknown
man, short and thick-set in figure and broad-shouldered, had a head like
a bull, to which, in fact, he bore more than one resemblance. His nose
seemed shorter than it was, on account of the thick nostrils. His full
lips, drawn from the teeth which were white as snow, his large and
round black eyes with their shaggy brows, his hanging ears and tawny
hair,--seemed to belong far less to our fine Caucasian race than to
a breed of herbivorous animals. The total absence of all the usual
characteristics of the social man made that bare head still more
remarkable. The face, bronzed by the sun (its angular outlines
presenting a sort of vague likeness to the granite which forms the
soil of the region), was the only visible portion of the body of this
singular being. From the neck down he was wrapped in a "sarrau" or
smock, a sort of russet linen blouse, coarser in texture than that of
the trousers of the less fortunate conscripts. This "sarrau," in which
an antiquary would have recognized the "saye," or the "sayon" of the
Gauls, ended at his middle, where it was fastened to two leggings of
goatskin by slivers, or thongs of wood, roughly cut,--some of them still
covered with their peel or bark. These hides of the nanny-goat (to give
them the name by which they were known to the peasantry) covered his
legs and thighs, and masked all appearance of human shape. Enormous
sabots hid his feet. His long and shining hair fell straight, like the
goat's hair, on either side of his face, being parted in the centre like
the hair of certain statues of the Middle-Ages which are still to
be seen in our cathedrals. In place of the knotty stick which the
conscripts carried over their shoulders, this man held against his
breast as though it were a musket, a heavy whip, the lash of which was
closely braided and seemed to be twice as long as that of an ordinary
whip. The sudden apparition of this strange being seemed easily
explained. At first sight some of the officers took him for a recruit or
conscript (the words were used indiscriminately) who had outstripped the
column. But the commandant himself was singularly surprised by the
man's presence; he showed no alarm, but his face grew thoughtful.
After looking the intruder well over, he repeated, mechanically, as if
preoccupied with anxious thought: "Yes, why don't they come on? do you
know, you?"

"Because," said the gloomy apparition, with an accent which proved his
