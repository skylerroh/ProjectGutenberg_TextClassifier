    (Let once our time of enterprize arrive)
    Shalt thou assail them. Many, as I judge,
    Of those proud suitors who devour thy wealth
    Shall leave their brains, then, on thy palace floor.
    But come. Behold! I will disguise thee so                        480
    That none shall know thee! I will parch the skin
    On thy fair body; I will cause thee shed
    Thy wavy locks; I will enfold thee round
    In such a kirtle as the eyes of all
    Shall loath to look on; and I will deform
    With blurring rheums thy eyes, so vivid erst;
    So shall the suitors deem thee, and thy wife,
    And thy own son whom thou didst leave at home,
    Some sordid wretch obscure. But seek thou first
    Thy swine-herd's mansion; he, alike, intends                     490
    Thy good, and loves, affectionate, thy son
    And thy Penelope; thou shalt find the swain
    Tending his herd; they feed beneath the rock
    Corax, at side of Arethusa's fount,
    On acorns dieted, nutritious food
    To them, and drinking of the limpid stream.
    There waiting, question him of thy concerns,
    While I from Sparta praised for women fair
    Call home thy son Telemachus, a guest
    With Menelaus now, whom to consult                               500
    In spacious Lacedaemon he is gone,
    Anxious to learn if yet his father lives.
      To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.
    And why, alas! all-knowing as thou art,
    Him left'st thou ignorant? was it that he,
    He also, wand'ring wide the barren Deep,
    Might suffer woe, while these devour his wealth?
      Him answer'd then Pallas caerulean-eyed.
    Grieve thou not much for him. I sent him forth
    Myself, that there arrived, he might acquire                     510
    Honour and fame. No suff'rings finds he there,
    But in Atrides' palace safe resides,
    Enjoying all abundance. Him, in truth,
    The suitors watch close ambush'd on the Deep,
    Intent to slay him ere he reach his home,
    But shall not as I judge, till of themselves
    The earth hide some who make thee, now, a prey.
      So saying, the Goddess touch'd him with a wand.
    At once o'er all his agile limbs she parch'd
    The polish'd skin; she wither'd to the root                      520
    His wavy locks; and cloath'd him with the hide
    Deform'd of wrinkled age; she charged with rheums
    His eyes before so vivid, and a cloak
    And kirtle gave him, tatter'd, both, and foul,
    And smutch'd with smoak; then, casting over all
    An huge old deer-skin bald, with a long staff
    She furnish'd him, and with a wallet patch'd
    On all sides, dangling by a twisted thong.
      Thus all their plan adjusted, diff'rent ways
    They took, and she, seeking Ulysses' son,                        530
    To Lacedaemon's spacious realm repair'd.

BOOK XIV

ARGUMENT

Ulysses arriving at the house of Eumaeus, is hospitably entertained, and
spends the night there.


    Leaving the haven-side, he turn'd his steps
    Into a rugged path, which over hills
    Mantled with trees led him to the abode
    By Pallas mention'd of his noble friend[61]
    The swine-herd, who of all Ulysses' train
    Watch'd with most diligence his rural stores.
    Him sitting in the vestibule he found
    Of his own airy lodge commodious, built
    Amidst a level lawn. That structure neat
    Eumaeus, in the absence of his Lord,                               10
    Had raised, himself, with stones from quarries hewn,
    Unaided by Laertes or the Queen.
    With tangled thorns he fenced it safe around,
    And with contiguous stakes riv'n from the trunks
    Of solid oak black-grain'd hemm'd it without.
    Twelve penns he made within, all side by side,
    Lairs for his swine, and fast-immured in each
    Lay fifty pregnant females on the floor.
    The males all slept without, less num'rous far,
    Thinn'd by the princely wooers at their feasts                    20
    Continual, for to them he ever sent
    The fattest of his saginated charge.
    Three hundred, still, and sixty brawns remained.
    Four mastiffs in adjoining kennels lay,
    Resembling wild-beasts nourish'd at the board
    Of the illustrious steward of the styes.
    Himself sat fitting sandals to his feet,
    Carved from a stain'd ox-hide. Four hinds he kept,
    Now busied here and there; three in the penns
    Were occupied; meantime, the fourth had sought                    30
    The city, whither, for the suitors' use,
    With no good will, but by constraint, he drove
    A boar, that, sacrificing to the Gods,
    Th' imperious guests might on his flesh regale.
      Soon as those clamorous watch-dogs the approach
    Saw of Ulysses, baying loud, they ran
    Toward him; he, as ever, well-advised,
    Squatted, and let his staff fall from his hand.
    Yet foul indignity he had endured
    Ev'n there, at his own farm, but that the swain,                  40
    Following his dogs in haste, sprang through the porch
    To his assistance, letting fall the hide.
    With chiding voice and vollied stones he soon
    Drove them apart, and thus his Lord bespake.
      Old man! one moment more, and these my dogs
    Had, past doubt, worried thee, who should'st have proved,
    So slain, a source of obloquy to me.
    But other pangs the Gods, and other woes
    To me have giv'n, who here lamenting sit
    My godlike master, and his fatted swine                           50
    Nourish for others' use, while he, perchance,
    A wand'rer in some foreign city, seeks
    Fit sustenance, and none obtains, if still
    Indeed he live, and view the light of day.
    But, old friend! follow me into the house,
    That thou, at least, with plenteous food refresh'd,
    And cheer'd with wine sufficient, may'st disclose
    Both who thou art, and all that thou hast borne.
      So saying, the gen'rous swine-herd introduced
    Ulysses, and thick bundles spread of twigs                        60
    Beneath him, cover'd with the shaggy skin
    Of a wild goat, of which he made his couch
    Easy and large; the Hero, so received,
    Rejoiced, and thus his gratitude express'd.
      Jove grant thee and the Gods above, my host,
    For such beneficence thy chief desire!
      To whom, Eumaeus, thou didst thus reply.
    My guest! I should offend, treating with scorn
    The stranger, though a poorer should arrive
    Than ev'n thyself; for all the poor that are,                     70
    And all the strangers are the care of Jove.
    Little, and with good will, is all that lies
    Within my scope; no man can much expect
    From servants living in continual fear
    Under young masters; for the Gods, no doubt,
    Have intercepted my own Lord's return,
    From whom great kindness I had, else, received,
    With such a recompense as servants gain
    From gen'rous masters, house and competence,
    And lovely wife from many a wooer won,                            80
    Whose industry should have requited well
    His goodness, with such blessing from the Gods
    As now attends me in my present charge.
    Much had I, therefore, prosper'd, had my Lord
    Grown old at home; but he hath died--I would
    That the whole house of Helen, one and all,
    Might perish too, for she hath many slain
    Who, like my master, went glory to win
    For Agamemnon in the fields of Troy.
      So saying, he girdled, quick, his tunic close,                  90
    And, issuing, sought the styes; thence bringing two
    Of the imprison'd herd, he slaughter'd both,
    Singed them, and slash'd and spitted them, and placed
    The whole well-roasted banquet, spits and all,
    Reeking before Ulysses; last, with flour
    He sprinkled them, and filling with rich wine
    His ivy goblet, to his master sat
    Opposite, whom inviting thus he said.
      Now, eat, my guest! such as a servant may
    I set before thee, neither large of growth                       100
    Nor fat; the fatted--those the suitors eat,
    Fearless of heav'n, and pitiless of man.
    Yet deeds unjust as theirs the blessed Gods
    Love not; they honour equity and right.
    Even an hostile band when they invade
    A foreign shore, which by consent of Jove
    They plunder, and with laden ships depart,
    Even they with terrours quake of wrath divine.
    But these are wiser; these must sure have learn'd
    From some true oracle my master's death,                         110
    Who neither deign with decency to woo,
    Nor yet to seek their homes, but boldly waste
    His substance, shameless, now, and sparing nought.
    Jove ne'er hath giv'n us yet the night or day
    When with a single victim, or with two
    They would content them, and his empty jars
    Witness how fast the squand'rers use his wine.
    Time was, when he was rich indeed; such wealth
    No Hero own'd on yonder continent,
    Nor yet in Ithaca; no twenty Chiefs                              120
    Could match with all their treasures his alone;
    I tell thee their amount. Twelve herds of his
    The mainland graze;[62] as many flocks of sheep;
    As many droves of swine; and hirelings there
    And servants of his own seed for his use,
    As many num'rous flocks of goats; his goats,
    (Not fewer than eleven num'rous flocks)
    Here also graze the margin of his fields
    Under the eye of servants well-approved,
    And ev'ry servant, ev'ry day, brings home                        130
    The goat, of all his flock largest and best.
    But as for me, I have these swine in charge,
    Of which, selected with exactest care
    From all the herd, I send the prime to them.
      He ceas'd, meantime Ulysses ate and drank
    Voracious, meditating, mute, the death
    Of those proud suitors. His repast, at length,
    Concluded, and his appetite sufficed,
    Eumaeus gave him, charged with wine, the cup
    From which he drank himself; he, glad, received                  140
    The boon, and in wing'd accents thus began.
      My friend, and who was he, wealthy and brave
    As thou describ'st the Chief, who purchased thee?
    Thou say'st he perish'd for the glory-sake
    Of Agamemnon. Name him; I, perchance,
    May have beheld the Hero. None can say
    But Jove and the inhabitants of heav'n
    That I ne'er saw him, and may not impart
    News of him; I have roam'd through many a clime.
      To whom the noble swine-herd thus replied.                     150
    Alas, old man! no trav'ler's tale of him
    Will gain his consort's credence, or his son's;
    For wand'rers, wanting entertainment, forge
    Falsehoods for bread, and wilfully deceive.
    No wand'rer lands in Ithaca, but he seeks
    With feign'd intelligence my mistress' ear;
    She welcomes all, and while she questions each
    Minutely, from her lids lets fall the tear
    Affectionate, as well beseems a wife
    Whose mate hath perish'd in a distant land.                      160
    Thou could'st thyself, no doubt, my hoary friend!
    (Would any furnish thee with decent vest
    And mantle) fabricate a tale with ease;
    Yet sure it is that dogs and fowls, long since,
    His skin have stript, or fishes of the Deep
    Have eaten him, and on some distant shore
    Whelm'd in deep sands his mould'ring bones are laid.
    So hath he perish'd; whence, to all his friends,
    But chiefly to myself, sorrow of heart;
    For such another Lord, gentle as he,                             170
    Wherever sought, I have no hope to find,
    Though I should wander even to the house
    Of my own father. Neither yearns my heart
    So feelingly (though that desiring too)
    To see once more my parents and my home,
    As to behold Ulysses yet again.
    Ah stranger; absent as he is, his name
    Fills me with rev'rence, for he lov'd me much,
    Cared for me much, and, though we meet no more,
    Holds still an elder brother's part in me.                       180
      Him answer'd, then, the Hero toil-inured.
    My friend! since his return, in thy account,
    Is an event impossible, and thy mind
    Always incredulous that hope rejects,
    I shall not slightly speak, but with an oath--
    Ulysses comes again; and I demand
    No more, than that the boon such news deserves,
    Be giv'n me soon as he shall reach his home.
    Then give me vest and mantle fit to wear,
    Which, ere that hour, much as I need them both,                  190
    I neither ask, nor will accept from thee.
    For him whom poverty can force aside
    From truth--I hate him as the gates of hell.
    Be Jove, of all in heav'n, my witness first,
    Then, this thy hospitable board, and, last,
    The household Gods of the illustrious Chief
    Himself, Ulysses, to whose gates I go,
    That all my words shall surely be fulfill'd.
    In this same year Ulysses shall arrive,
    Ere, this month closed, another month succeed,                   200
    He shall return, and punish all who dare
    Insult his consort and his noble son.
      To whom Eumaeus, thou didst thus reply.
    Old friend! that boon thou wilt ne'er earn from me;
    Ulysses comes no more. But thou thy wine
    Drink quietly, and let us find, at length,
    Some other theme; recall not this again
    To my remembrance, for my soul is grieved
    Oft as reminded of my honour'd Lord.
    Let the oath rest, and let Ulysses come                          210
    Ev'n as myself, and as Penelope,
    And as his ancient father, and his son
    Godlike Telemachus, all wish he may.
    Ay--there I feel again--nor cease to mourn
    His son Telemachus; who, when the Gods
    Had giv'n him growth like a young plant, and I
    Well hoped that nought inferior he should prove
    In person or in mind to his own sire,
    Hath lost, through influence human or divine,
    I know not how, his sober intellect,                             220
    And after tidings of his sire is gone
    To far-famed Pylus; his return, meantime,
    In ambush hidden the proud suitors wait,
    That the whole house may perish of renown'd
    Arcesias, named in Ithaca no more.
    But whether he have fallen or 'scaped, let him
    Rest also, whom Saturnian Jove protect!
    But come, my ancient guest! now let me learn
    Thy own afflictions; answer me in truth.
    Who, and whence art thou? in what city born?                     230
    Where dwell thy parents; in what kind of ship
    Cam'st thou? the mariners, why brought they thee
    To Ithaca? and of what land are they?
    For, that on foot thou found'st us not, is sure.
      Him answer'd, then, Ulysses, ever-wise.
    I will with truth resolve thee; and if here
    Within thy cottage sitting, we had wine
    And food for many a day, and business none
    But to regale at ease while others toiled,
    I could exhaust the year complete, my woes                       240
    Rehearsing, nor, at last, rehearse entire
    My sorrows by the will of heav'n sustained.
      I boast me sprung from ancestry renown'd
    In spacious Crete; son of a wealthy sire,
    Who other sons train'd num'rous in his house,
    Born of his wedded wife; but he begat
    Me on his purchased concubine, whom yet
    Dear as his other sons in wedlock born
    Castor Hylacides esteem'd and lov'd,
    For him I boast my father. Him in Crete,                         250
    While yet he liv'd, all reverenc'd as a God,
    So rich, so prosp'rous, and so blest was he
    With sons of highest praise. But death, the doom
    Of all, him bore to Pluto's drear abode,
    And his illustrious sons among themselves
    Portion'd his goods by lot; to me, indeed,
    They gave a dwelling, and but little more,
    Yet, for my virtuous qualities, I won
    A wealthy bride, for I was neither vain
    Nor base, forlorn as thou perceiv'st me now.                     260
    But thou canst guess, I judge, viewing the straw
    What once was in the ear. Ah! I have borne
    Much tribulation; heap'd and heavy woes.
    Courage and phalanx-breaking might had I
    From Mars and Pallas; at what time I drew,
    (Planning some dread exploit) an ambush forth
    Of our most valiant Chiefs, no boding fears
    Of death seized _me_, but foremost far of all
    I sprang to fight, and pierced the flying foe.
    Such was I once in arms. But household toils                     270
    Sustain'd for children's sake, and carking cares
    T' enrich a family, were not for me.
    My pleasures were the gallant bark, the din
    Of battle, the smooth spear and glitt'ring shaft,
    Objects of dread to others, but which me
    The Gods disposed to love and to enjoy.
    Thus diff'rent minds are diff'rently amused;
    For ere Achaia's fleet had sailed to Troy,
    Nine times was I commander of an host
    Embark'd against a foreign foe, and found                        280
    In all those enterprizes great success.
    From the whole booty, first, what pleased me most
    Chusing, and sharing also much by lot
    I rapidly grew rich, and had thenceforth
    Among the Cretans rev'rence and respect.
    But when loud-thund'ring Jove that voyage dire
    Ordain'd, which loos'd the knees of many a Greek,
    Then, to Idomeneus and me they gave
    The charge of all their fleet, which how to avoid
    We found not, so importunate the cry                             290
    Of the whole host impell'd us to the task.
    There fought we nine long years, and in the tenth
    (Priam's proud city pillag'd) steer'd again
    Our galleys homeward, which the Gods dispersed.
    Then was it that deep-planning Jove devised
    For me much evil. One short month, no more,
    I gave to joys domestic, in my wife
    Happy, and in my babes, and in my wealth,
    When the desire seiz'd me with sev'ral ships
    Well-rigg'd, and furnish'd all with gallant crews,               300
    To sail for AEgypt; nine I fitted forth,
    To which stout mariners assembled fast.
    Six days the chosen partners of my voyage
    Feasted, to whom I num'rous victims gave
    For sacrifice, and for their own regale.
    Embarking on the sev'nth from spacious Crete,
    Before a clear breeze prosp'rous from the North
    We glided easily along, as down
    A river's stream; nor one of all my ships
    Damage incurr'd, but healthy and at ease                         310
    We sat, while gales well-managed urged us on.
    The fifth day thence, smooth-flowing Nile we reach'd,
    And safe I moor'd in the AEgyptian stream.
    Then, charging all my mariners to keep
    Strict watch for preservation of the ships,
    I order'd spies into the hill-tops; but they
    Under the impulse of a spirit rash
    And hot for quarrel, the well-cultur'd fields
    Pillaged of the AEgyptians, captive led
    Their wives and little ones, and slew the men.                   320
    Soon was the city alarm'd, and at the cry
    Down came the citizens, by dawn of day,
    With horse and foot, and with the gleam of arms
    Filling the plain. Then Jove with panic dread
    Struck all my people; none found courage more
    To stand, for mischiefs swarm'd on ev'ry side.
    There, num'rous by the glittering spear we fell
    Slaughter'd, while others they conducted thence
    Alive to servitude. But Jove himself
    My bosom with this thought inspired, (I would                    330
    That, dying, I had first fulfill'd my fate
    In AEgypt, for new woes were yet to come!)
    Loosing my brazen casque, and slipping off
    My buckler, there I left them on the field,
    Then cast my spear away, and seeking, next,
    The chariot of the sov'reign, clasp'd his knees,
    And kiss'd them. He, by my submission moved,
    Deliver'd me, and to his chariot-seat
    Raising, convey'd me weeping to his home.
    With many an ashen spear his warriors sought                     340
    To slay me, (for they now grew fiery wroth)
    But he, through fear of hospitable Jove,
    Chief punisher of wrong, saved me alive.
    Sev'n years I there abode, and much amass'd
    Among the AEgyptians, gifted by them all;
    But, in the eighth revolving year, arrived
    A shrewd Phoenician, in all fraud adept,
    Hungry, and who had num'rous harm'd before,
    By whom I also was cajoled, and lured
    T' attend him to Phoenicia, where his house                      350
    And his possessions lay; there I abode
    A year complete his inmate; but (the days
    And months accomplish'd of the rolling year,
    And the new seasons ent'ring on their course)
    To Lybia then, on board his bark, by wiles
    He won me with him, partner of the freight
    Profess'd, but destin'd secretly to sale,
    That he might profit largely by my price.
    Not unsuspicious, yet constrain'd to go,
    With this man I embark'd. A cloudless gale                       360
    Propitious blowing from the North, our ship
    Ran right before it through the middle sea,
    In the offing over Crete; but adverse Jove
    Destruction plann'd for them and death the while.
    For, Crete now left afar, and other land
    Appearing none, but sky alone and sea,
    Right o'er the hollow bark Saturnian Jove
    A cloud caerulean hung, dark'ning the Deep.
    Then, thund'ring oft, he hurl'd into the bark
    His bolts; she smitten by the fires of Jove,                     370
    Quaked all her length; with sulphur fill'd she reek'd,
    And, o'er her sides precipitated, plunged
    Like gulls the crew, forbidden by that stroke
    Of wrath divine to hope their country more.
    But Jove himself, when I had cast away
    All hope of life, conducted to my arms
    The strong tall mast, that I might yet escape.
    Around that beam I clung, driving before
    The stormy blast. Nine days complete I drove,
    And, on the tenth dark night, the rolling flood                  380
    Immense convey'd me to Thesprotia's shore.
    There me the Hero Phidon, gen'rous King
    Of the Thesprotians, freely entertained;
    For his own son discov'ring me with toil
    Exhausted and with cold, raised me, and thence
    Led me humanely to his father's house,
    Who cherish'd me, and gave me fresh attire.
    There heard I of Ulysses, whom himself
    Had entertain'd, he said, on his return
    To his own land; he shew'd me also gold,                         390
    Brass, and bright steel elab'rate, whatsoe'er
    Ulysses had amass'd, a store to feed
    A less illustrious family than his
    To the tenth generation, so immense
    His treasures in the royal palace lay.
    Himself, he said, was to Dodona gone,
    There, from the tow'ring oaks of Jove to ask
    Counsel divine, if openly to land
    (After long absence) in his opulent realm
    Of Ithaca, be best, or in disguise.                              400
    To me the monarch swore, in his own hall
    Pouring libation, that the ship was launch'd,
    And the crew ready for his conduct home.
    But me he first dismiss'd, for, as it chanced,
    A ship lay there of the Thesprotians, bound
    To green Dulichium's isle. He bade the crew
    Bear me to King Acastus with all speed;
    But them far other thoughts pleased more, and thoughts
    Of harm to me, that I might yet be plunged
    In deeper gulphs of woe than I had known.                        410
    For, when the billow-cleaving bark had left
    The land remote, framing, combined, a plot
    Against my liberty, they stripp'd my vest
    And mantle, and this tatter'd raiment foul
    Gave me instead, which thy own eyes behold.
    At even-tide reaching the cultur'd coast
    Of Ithaca, they left me bound on board
    With tackle of the bark, and quitting ship
    Themselves, made hasty supper on the shore.
    But me, meantime, the Gods easily loos'd                         420
    By their own pow'r, when, with wrapper vile
    Around my brows, sliding into the sea
    At the ship's stern, I lay'd me on the flood.
    With both hands oaring thence my course, I swam
    Till past all ken of theirs; then landing where
    Thick covert of luxuriant trees I mark'd,
    Close couchant down I lay; they mutt'ring loud,
    Paced to and fro, but deeming farther search
    Unprofitable, soon embark'd again.
    Thus baffling all their search with ease, the Gods               430
    Conceal'd and led me thence to the abode
    Of a wise man, dooming me still to live.
      To whom, Eumaeus, thou didst thus reply,
    Alas! my most compassionable guest!
    Thou hast much moved me by this tale minute
    Of thy sad wand'rings and thy num'rous woes.
    But, speaking of Ulysses, thou hast pass'd
    All credence; I at least can give thee none.
    Why, noble as thou art, should'st thou invent
    Palpable falsehoods? as for the return                           440
    Of my regretted Lord, myself I know
    That had he not been hated by the Gods
    Unanimous, he had in battle died
    At Troy, or (that long doubtful war, at last,
    Concluded,) in his people's arms at home.
    Then universal Greece had raised his tomb,
    And he had even for his son atchiev'd
    Immortal glory; but alas! by beaks
    Of harpies torn, unseemly sight, he lies.
    Here is my home the while; I never seek                          450
    The city, unless summon'd by discrete
    Penelope to listen to the news
    Brought by some stranger, whencesoe'er arrived.
    Then, all, alike inquisitive, attend,
    Both who regret the absence of our King,
    And who rejoice gratuitous to gorge
    His property; but as for me, no joy
    Find I in list'ning after such reports,
    Since an AEtolian cozen'd me, who found
    (After long wand'ring over various lands                         460
    A fugitive for blood) my lone retreat.
    Him warm I welcom'd, and with open arms
    Receiv'd, who bold affirm'd that he had seen
    My master with Idomeneus at Crete
    His ships refitting shatter'd by a storm,
    And that in summer with his godlike band
    He would return, bringing great riches home,
    Or else in autumn. And thou ancient guest
    Forlorn! since thee the Gods have hither led,
    Seek not to gratify me with untruths                             470
    And to deceive me, since for no such cause
    I shall respect or love thee, but alone
    By pity influenced, and the fear of Jove.
      To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.
    Thou hast, in truth, a most incredulous mind,
    Whom even with an oath I have not moved,
    Or aught persuaded. Come then--let us make
    In terms express a cov'nant, and the Gods
    Who hold Olympus, witness to us both!
    If thy own Lord at this thy house arrive,                        480
    Thou shalt dismiss me decently attired
    In vest and mantle, that I may repair
    Hence to Dulichium, whither I would go.
    But, if thy Lord come not, then, gath'ring all
    Thy servants, headlong hurl me from a rock,
    That other mendicants may fear to lie.
      To whom the generous swine-herd in return.
    Yes, stranger! doubtless I should high renown
    Obtain for virtue among men, both now
    And in all future times, if, having first                        490
    Invited thee, and at my board regaled,
    I, next, should slay thee; then my pray'rs would mount,
    Past question, swiftly to Saturnian Jove.
    But the hour calls to supper, and, ere long,
    The partners of my toils will come prepared
    To spread the board with no unsav'ry cheer.
      Thus they conferr'd. And now the swains arrived,
    Driving their charge, which fast they soon enclosed
    Within their customary penns, and loud
