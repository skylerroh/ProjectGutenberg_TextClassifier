
                            The true healing

230:27  We think that we are healed when a disease disap-
        pears, though it is liable to reappear; but we are never
        thoroughly healed until the liability to be
230:30  ill is removed. So-called mortal mind or the
        mind of mortals being the remote, predisposing, and
        the exciting cause of all suffering, the cause of disease
231:1   must be obliterated through Christ in divine Science, or
        the so-called physical senses will get the victory.

                         Destruction of all evil

231:3   Unless an ill is rightly met and fairly overcome by
        Truth, the ill is never conquered. If God destroys not
        sin, sickness, and death, they are not de-
231:6   stroyed in the mind of mortals, but seem to
        this so-called mind to be immortal. What God cannot
        do, man need not attempt. If God heals not the sick,
231:9   they are not healed, for no lesser power equals the infinite
        All-power; but God, Truth, Life, Love, does heal the
        sick through the prayer of the righteous.

231:12  If God makes sin, if good produces evil, if truth results
        in error, then Science and Christianity are helpless; but
        there are no antagonistic powers nor laws, spiritual or
231:15  material, creating and governing man through perpetual
        warfare. God is not the author of mortal discords.
        Therefore we accept the conclusion that discords have
231:18  only a fabulous existence, are mortal beliefs which divine
        Truth and Love destroy.

                     Superiority to sickness and sin

        To hold yourself superior to sin, because God made
231:21  you superior to it and governs man, is true wisdom. To
        fear sin is to misunderstand the power of Love
        and the divine Science of being in man's rela-
231:24  tion to God, - to doubt His government and
        distrust His omnipotent care. To hold yourself superior
        to sickness and death is equally wise, and is in accordance
231:27  with divine Science. To fear them is impossible, when
        you fully apprehend God and know that they are no part
        of His creation.

231:30  Man, governed by his Maker, having no other Mind, -
        planted on the Evangelist's statement that "all things
        were made by Him [the Word of God]; and without
232:1   Him was not anything made that was made," - can
        triumph over sin, sickness, and death.

                         Denials of divine power

232:3   Many theories relative to God and man neither make
        man harmonious nor God lovable. The beliefs we com-
        monly entertain about happiness and life
232:6   afford no scatheless and permanent evidence
        of either. Security for the claims of harmonious and
        eternal being is found only in divine Science.

232:9   Scripture informs us that "with God all things are
        possible," - all good is possible to Spirit; but our prev-
        alent theories practically deny this, and make healing
232:12  possible only through matter. These theories must be
        untrue, for the Scripture is true. Christianity is not
        false, but religions which contradict its Principle are
232:15  false.

        In our age Christianity is again demonstrating the
        power of divine Principle, as it did over nineteen hun-
232:18  dred years ago, by healing the sick and triumphing over
        death. Jesus never taught that drugs, food, air, and ex-
        ercise could make a man healthy, or that they could de-
232:21  stroy human life; nor did he illustrate these errors by his
        practice. He referred man's harmony to Mind, not to
        matter, and never tried to make of none effect the sen-
232:24  tence of God, which sealed God's condemnation of sin,
        sickness, and death.

                             Signs following

        In the sacred sanctuary of Truth are voices of sol-
232:27  emn import, but we heed them not. It is only when the
        so-called pleasures and pains of sense pass
        away in our lives, that we find unquestion-
232:30  able signs of the burial of error and the resurrection to
        spiritual life.

                          Profession and proof

        There is neither place nor opportunity in Science for error
233:1   of any sort. Every day makes its demands upon us for
        higher proofs rather than professions of Christian power.
233:3   These proofs consist solely in the destruction
        of sin, sickness, and death by the power of
        Spirit, as Jesus destroyed them. This is an element of
233:6   progress, and progress is the law of God, whose law de-
        mands of us only what we can certainly fulfil.

                        Perfection gained slowly

        In the midst of imperfection, perfection is seen and
233:9   acknowledged only by degrees. The ages must slowly
        work up to perfection. How long it must be
        before we arrive at the demonstration of scien-
233:12  tific being, no man knoweth, - not even "the
        Son but the Father;" but the false claim of error con-
        tinues its delusions until the goal of goodness is assidu-
233:15  ously earned and won.

                            Christ's mission

        Already the shadow of His right hand rests upon the
        hour. Ye who can discern the face of the sky, - the
233:18  sign material, - how much more should ye
        discern the sign mental, and compass the de-
        struction of sin and sickness by overcoming the thoughts
233:21  which produce them, and by understanding the spiritual
        idea which corrects and destroys them. To reveal this
        truth was our Master's mission to all mankind, including
233:24  the hearts which rejected him.

                            Efficacy of truth

        When numbers have been divided according to a fixed
        rule, the quotient is not more unquestionable than the
233:27  scientific tests I have made of the effects of
        truth upon the sick. The counter fact rela-
        tive to any disease is required to cure it. The utterance
233:30  of truth is designed to rebuke and destroy error. Why
        should truth not be efficient in sickness, which is solely
        the result of inharmony?

234:1   Spiritual draughts heal, while material lotions interfere
        with truth, even as ritualism and creed hamper spirit-
234:3   uality. If we trust matter, we distrust Spirit.

                            Crumbs of comfort

        Whatever inspires with wisdom, Truth, or Love - be
        it song, sermon, or Science - blesses the human family
234:6   with crumbs of comfort from Christ's table
        feeding the hungry and giving living waters to
        the thirsty.

                     Hospitality to health and good

234:9   We should become more familiar with good than with
        evil, and guard against false beliefs as watchfully as we
        bar our doors against the approach of thieves
234:12  and murderers. We should love our enemies
        and help them on the basis of the Golden
        Rule; but avoid casting pearls before those who trample
234:15  them under foot, thereby robbing both themselves and
        others.

                           Cleansing the mind

        If mortals would keep proper ward over mortal mind,
234:18  the brood of evils which infest it would be cleared out.
        We must begin with this so-called mind and
        empty it of sin and sickness, or sin and sick-
234:21  ness will never cease. The present codes of human
        systems disappoint the weary searcher after a divine
        theology, adequate to the right education of human
234:24  thought.

        Sin and disease must be thought before they can be
        manifested. You must control evil thoughts in the first
234:27  instance, or they will control you in the second. Jesus
        declared that to look with desire on forbidden objects was
        to break a moral precept. He laid great stress on the
234:30  action of the human mind, unseen to the senses.

        Evil thoughts and aims reach no farther and do no more
        harm than one's belief permits. Evil thoughts, lusts, and
235:1   malicious purposes cannot go forth, like wandering pollen,
        from one human mind to another, finding unsuspected
235:3   lodgment, if virtue and truth build a strong defence.
        Better suffer a doctor infected with smallpox to attend
        you than to be treated mentally by one who does not obey
235:6   the requirements of divine Science.

                           Teachers' functions

        The teachers of schools and the readers in churches
        should be selected with as direct reference to their
235:9   morals as to their learning or their correct
        reading. Nurseries of character should be
        strongly garrisoned with virtue. School-examinations are
235:12  one-sided; it is not so much academic education, as a
        moral and spiritual culture, which lifts one higher. The
        pure and uplifting thoughts of the teacher, constantly
235:15  imparted to pupils, will reach higher than the heavens of
        astronomy; while the debased and unscrupulous mind,
        though adorned with gems of scholarly attainment, will
235:18  degrade the characters it should inform and elevate.

                          Physicians' privilege

        Physicians, whom the sick employ in their helplessness,
        should be models of virtue. They should be wise spir-
235:21  itual guides to health and hope. To the trem-
        blers on the brink of death, who understand
        not the divine Truth which is Life and perpetuates being,
235:24  physicians should be able to teach it. Then when the soul
        is willing and the flesh weak, the patient's feet may be
        planted on the rock Christ Jesus, the true idea of spiritual
235:27  power.

                            Clergymen's duty

        Clergymen, occupying the watchtowers of the world,
        should uplift the standard of Truth. They should so raise
235:30  their hearers spiritually, that their listeners
        will love to grapple with a new, right idea
        and broaden their concepts. Love of Christianity, rather
236:1   than love of popularity, should stimulate clerical labor
        and progress. Truth should emanate from the pulpit,
236:3   but never be strangled there. A special privilege is vested
        in the ministry. How shall it be used? Sacredly, in the
        interests of humanity, not of sect.

236:6   Is it not professional reputation and emolument rather
        than the dignity of God's laws, which many leaders seek?
        Do not inferior motives induce the infuriated attacks on
236:9   individuals, who reiterate Christ's teachings in support
        of his proof by example that the divine Mind heals sick-
        ness as well as sin?

                        A mother's responsibility

236:12  A mother is the strongest educator, either for or
        against crime. Her thoughts form the embryo of an-
        other mortal mind, and unconsciously mould
236:15  it, either after a model odious to herself or
        through divine influence, "according to the pattern
        showed to thee in the mount." Hence the importance
236:18  of Christian Science, from which we learn of the one
        Mind and of the availability of good as the remedy for
        every woe.

                         Children's tractability

236:21  Children should obey their parents; insubordination
        is an evil, blighting the buddings of self-government.
        Parents should teach their children at the
236:24  earliest possible period the truths of health
        and holiness. Children are more tractable than adults,
        and learn more readily to love the simple verities that will
236:27  make them happy and good.

        Jesus loved little children because of their freedom
        from wrong and their receptiveness of right. While
236:30  age is halting between two opinions or battling with
        false beliefs, youth makes easy and rapid strides towards
        Truth.

237:1   A little girl, who had occasionally listened to my ex-
        planations, badly wounded her finger. She seemed not
237:3   to notice it. On being questioned about it she answered
        ingenuously, "There is no sensation in matter." Bound-
        ing off with laughing eyes, she presently added, "Mamma,
237:6   my finger is not a bit sore."

                              Soil and seed

        It might have been months or years before her parents
        would have laid aside their drugs, or reached the mental
237:9   height their little daughter so naturally at-
        tained. The more stubborn beliefs and theo-
        ries of parents often choke the good seed in the minds of
237:12  themselves and their offspring. Superstition, like "the
        fowls of the air," snatches away the good seed before it
        has sprouted.

                            Teaching children

237:15  Children should be taught the Truth-cure, Christian
        Science, among their first lessons, and kept from discuss-
        ing or entertaining theories or thoughts about
237:18  sickness. To prevent the experience of error
        and its sufferings, keep out of the minds of your children
        either sinful or diseased thoughts. The latter should
237:21  be excluded on the same principle as the former. This
        makes Christian Science early available.

                            Deluded invalids

        Some invalids are unwilling to know the facts or to
237:24  hear about the fallacy of matter and its supposed laws.
        They devote themselves a little longer to their
        material gods, cling to a belief in the life and
237:27  intelligence of matter, and expect this error to do more
        for them than they are willing to admit the only living and
        true God can do. Impatient at your explanation, unwill-
237:30  ing to investigate the Science of Mind which would rid
        them of their complaints, they hug false beliefs and suffer
        the delusive consequences.

                             Patient waiting

238:1   Motives and acts are not rightly valued before they are
        understood. It is well to wait till those whom you would
238:3   benefit are ready for the blessing, for Science
        is working changes in personal character as
        well as in the material universe.
238:6   To obey the Scriptural command, "Come out from
        among them, and be ye separate," is to incur society's
        frown; but this frown, more than flatteries, enables one
238:9   to be Christian. Losing her crucifix, the Roman Catholic
        girl said, "I have nothing left but Christ." "If God be
        for us, who can be against us?"

                        Unimproved opportunities

238:12  To fall away from Truth in times of persecution, shows
        that we never understood Truth. From out the bridal
        chamber of wisdom there will come the warn-
238:15  ing, "I know you not." Unimproved op-
        portunities will rebuke us when we attempt to claim the
        benefits of an experience we have not made our own, try
238:18  to reap the harvest we have not sown, and wish to enter
        unlawfully into the labors of others. Truth often remains
        unsought, until we seek this remedy for human woe be-
238:21  cause we suffer severely from error.

        Attempts to conciliate society and so gain dominion over
        mankind, arise from worldly weakness. He who leaves
238:24  all for Christ forsakes popularity and gains Christianity.

                         Society and intolerance

        Society is a foolish juror, listening only to one side of
        the case. Justice often comes too late to secure a verdict.
238:27  People with mental work before them have
        no time for gossip about false law or testimony.
        To reconstruct timid justice and place the fact above the
238:30  falsehood, is the work of time.

        The cross is the central emblem of history. It is the
        lodestar in the demonstration of Christian healing, - the
239:1   demonstration by which sin and sickness are destroyed.
        The sects, which endured the lash of their predecessors,
239:3   in their turn lay it upon those who are in advance of
        creeds.

                         Right views of humanity

        Take away wealth, fame, and social organizations,
239:6   which weigh not one jot in the balance of God, and we
        get clearer views of Principle. Break up
        cliques, level wealth with honesty, let worth
239:9   be judged according to wisdom, and we get better views
        of humanity.

        The wicked man is not the ruler of his upright
239:12  neighbor. Let it be understood that success in error is
        defeat in Truth. The watchword of Christian Science
        is Scriptural: "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
239:15  unrighteous man his thoughts."

                           Standpoint revealed

        To ascertain our progress, we must learn where our
        affections are placed and whom we acknowledge and
239:18  obey as God. If divine Love is becoming
        nearer, dearer, and more real to us, matter is
        then submitting to Spirit. The objects we pursue and
239:21  the spirit we manifest reveal our standpoint, and show
        what we are winning.

                          Antagonistic sources

        Mortal mind is the acknowledged seat of human mo-
239:24  tives. It forms material concepts and produces every
        discordant action of the body. If action pro-
        ceeds from the divine Mind, action is harmo-
239:27  nious. If it comes from erring mortal mind, it is discord-
        ant and ends in sin, sickness, death. Those two opposite
        sources never mingle in fount or stream. The perfect
239:30  Mind sends forth perfection, for God is Mind. Imper-
        fect mortal mind sends forth its own resemblances, of
        which the wise man said, "All is vanity."

                        Some lessons from nature

240:1   Nature voices natural, spiritual law and divine Love,
        but human belief misinterprets nature. Arctic regions,
240:3   sunny tropics, giant hills, winged winds,
        mighty billows, verdant vales, festive flowers,
        and glorious heavens, - all point to Mind, the spiritual
240:6   intelligence they reflect. The floral apostles are hiero-
        glyphs of Deity. Suns and planets teach grand lessons.
        The stars make night beautiful, and the leaflet turns nat-
240:9   urally towards the light.

                            Perpetual motions

        In the order of Science, in which the Principle is above
        what it reflects, all is one grand concord. Change this
240:12  statement, suppose Mind to be governed by
        matter or Soul in body, and you lose the key-
        note of being, and there is continual discord. Mind is
240:15  perpetual motion. Its symbol is the sphere. The rota-
        tions and revolutions of the universe of Mind go on
        eternally.

                            Progress demanded

240:18  Mortals move onward towards good or evil as time
        glides on. If mortals are not progressive, past failures
        will be repeated until all wrong work is ef-
240:21  faced or rectified. If at present satisfied with
        wrong-doing, we must learn to loathe it. If at present
        content with idleness, we must become dissatisfied with
240:24  it. Remember that mankind must sooner or later, either
        by suffering or by Science, be convinced of the error that
        is to be overcome.

240:27  In trying to undo the errors of sense one must pay fully
        and fairly the utmost farthing, until all error is finally
        brought into subjection to Truth. The divine method
240:30  of paying sin's wages involves unwinding one's snarls
        and learning from experience how to divide between sense
        and Soul.

241:1   "Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth." He, who
        knows God's will or the demands of divine Science and
241:3   obeys them, incurs the hostility of envy; and he who
        refuses obedience to God, is chastened by Love.

                             The doom of sin

        Sensual treasures are laid up "where moth and rust
241:6   doth corrupt." Mortality is their doom. Sin breaks in
        upon them, and carries off their fleeting joys.
        The sensualist's affections are as imaginary,
241:9   whimsical, and unreal as his pleasures. Falsehood, envy,
        hypocrisy, malice, hate, revenge, and so forth, steal away
        the treasures of Truth. Stripped of its coverings, what
241:12  a mocking spectacle is sin!

                            Spirit transforms

        The Bible teaches transformation of the body by the
        renewal of Spirit. Take away the spiritual signification
241:15  of Scripture, and that compilation can do no
        more for mortals than can moonbeams to melt
        a river of ice. The error of the ages is preaching without
241:18  practice.

        The substance of all devotion is the reflection and
        demonstration of divine Love, healing sickness and
241:21  destroying sin. Our Master said, "If ye love me, keep
        my commandments."

        One's aim, a point beyond faith, should be to find the
241:24  footsteps of Truth, the way to health and holiness. We
        should strive to reach the Horeb height where God is re-
        vealed; and the corner-stone of all spiritual building is
241:27  purity. The baptism of Spirit, washing the body of all
        the impurities of flesh, signifies that the pure in heart
        see God and are approaching spiritual Life and its
241:30  demonstration.

                            Spiritual baptism

        It is "easier for a camel to go through the eye of a
        needle," than for sinful beliefs to enter the kingdom of
242:1   heaven, eternal harmony. Through repentance, spiritual
        baptism, and regeneration, mortals put off their material
242:3   beliefs and false individuality. It is only a
        question of time when "they shall all know
        Me [God], from the least of them unto the greatest."
242:6   Denial of the claims of matter is a great step towards
        the joys of Spirit, towards human freedom and the final
        triumph over the body.

                            The one only way

242:9   There is but one way to heaven, harmony, and Christ
        in divine Science shows us this way. It is to know no
        other reality - to have no other conscious-
242:12  ness of life - than good, God and His reflec-
        tion, and to rise superior to the so-called pain and pleasure
        of the senses.

242:15  Self-love is more opaque than a solid body. In pa-
        tient obedience to a patient God, let us labor to dis-
        solve with the universal solvent of Love the adamant
242:18  of error, - self-will, self-justification, and self-love, -
        which wars against spirituality and is the law of sin
        and death.

                            Divided vestments

242:21  The vesture of Life is Truth. According to the Bible,
        the facts of being are commonly misconstrued, for it is
        written: "They parted my raiment among
242:24  them, and for my vesture they did cast lots."
        The divine Science of man is woven into one web of
        consistency without seam or rent. Mere speculation or
242:27  superstition appropriates no part of the divine vesture,
        while inspiration restores every part of the Christly gar-
        ment of righteousness.

242:30  The finger-posts of divine Science show the way our
        Master trod, and require of Christians the proof which
        he gave, instead of mere profession. We may hide
243:1   spiritual ignorance from the world, but we can never
        succeed in the Science and demonstration of spiritual
243:3   good through ignorance or hypocrisy.

                       Ancient and modern miracles

        The divine Love, which made harmless the poisonous
        viper, which delivered men from the boiling oil, from
243:6   the fiery furnace, from the jaws of the lion,
        can heal the sick in every age and triumph
        over sin and death. It crowned the demon-
243:9   strations of Jesus with unsurpassed power and love. But
        the same "Mind . . . which was also in Christ Jesus"
        must always accompany the letter of Science in order to
243:12  confirm and repeat the ancient demonstrations of prophets
        and apostles. That those wonders are not more com-
        monly repeated to-day, arises not so much from lack of
243:15  desire as from lack of spiritual growth.

                            Mental telegraphy

        The clay cannot reply to the potter. The head, heart,
        lungs, and limbs do not inform us that they are dizzy,
243:18  diseased, consumptive, or lame. If this in-
        formation is conveyed, mortal mind conveys
        it. Neither immortal and unerring Mind nor matter,
243:21  the inanimate substratum of mortal mind, can carry
        on such telegraphy; for God is "of purer eyes than
        to behold evil," and matter has neither intelligence nor
243:24  sensation.

                          Annihilation of error

        Truth has no consciousness of error. Love has no
        sense of hatred. Life has no partnership
243:27  with death. Truth, Life, and Love are a law
        of annihilation to everything unlike themselves, because
        they declare nothing except God.

                        Deformity and perfection

243:30  Sickness, sin, and death are not the fruits of Life.
        They are inharmonies which Truth destroys. Perfection
        does not animate imperfection. Inasmuch as God is
244:1   good and the fount of all being, He does not produce
        moral or physical deformity; therefore such deformity is
244:3   not real, but is illusion, the mirage of error.
        Divine Science reveals these grand facts. On
        their basis Jesus demonstrated Life, never
244:6   fearing nor obeying error in any form.

        If we were to derive all our conceptions of man from
        what is seen between the cradle and the grave, happi-
244:9   ness and goodness would have no abiding-place in man,
        and the worms would rob him of the flesh; but Paul
        writes: "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath
244:12  made me free from the law of sin and death."

                         Man never less than man

        Man undergoing birth, maturity, and decay is like the
        beasts and vegetables, - subject to laws of decay. If
244:15  man were dust in his earliest stage of exist-
        ence, we might admit the hypothesis that he
        returns eventually to his primitive condition;
244:18  but man was never more nor less than man.

        If man flickers out in death or springs from matter into
        being, there must be an instant when God is without His
244:21  entire manifestation, - when there is no full reflection
        of the infinite Mind.

                             Man not evolved

        Man in Science is neither young nor old. He has
244:24  neither birth nor death. He is not a beast, a vegetable,
        nor a migratory mind. He does not pass from
        matter to Mind, from the mortal to the im-
244:27  mortal, from evil to good, or from good to evil. Such
        admissions cast us headlong into darkness and dogma.
        Even Shakespeare's poetry pictures age as infancy, as
244:30  helplessness and decadence, instead of assigning to man
        the everlasting grandeur and immortality of development,
        power, and prestige.

245:1   The error of thinking that we are growing old, and the
        benefits of destroying that illusion, are illustrated in a
245:3   sketch from the history of an English woman, published
        in the London medical magazine called The Lancet.

                             Perpetual youth

        Disappointed in love in her early years, she became
245:6   insane and lost all account of time. Believing that she
        was still living in the same hour which parted
        her from her lover, taking no note of years,
245:9   she stood daily before the window watching for her
        lover's coming. In this mental state she remained young.
        Having no consciousness of time, she literally grew no
245:12  older. Some American travellers saw her when she was
        seventy-four, and supposed her to be a young woman.
        She had no care-lined face, no wrinkles nor gray hair, but
245:15  youth sat gently on cheek and brow. Asked to guess her
        age, those unacquainted with her history conjectured that
        she must be under twenty.

245:18  This instance of youth preserved furnishes a useful
        hint, upon which a Franklin might work with more cer-
        tainty than when he coaxed the enamoured lightning
245:21  from the clouds. Years had not made her old, because
        she had taken no cognizance of passing time nor thought
        of herself as growing old. The bodily results of her belief
245:24  that she was young manifested the influence of such a be-
        lief. She could not age while believing herself young, for
        the mental state governed the physical.

245:27  Impossibilities never occur. One instance like the
        foregoing proves it possible to be young at seventy-four;
        and the primary of that illustration makes it plain that
245:30  decrepitude is not according to law, nor is it a necessity of
        nature, but an illusion.

                            Man reflects God

        The infinite never began nor will it ever end. Mind
246:1   and its formations can never be annihilated. Man is not
        a pendulum, swinging between evil and good, joy and
246:3   sorrow, sickness and health, life and death.
        Life and its faculties are not measured by
        calendars. The perfect and immortal are the eternal
246:6   likeness of their Maker. Man is by no means a material
        germ rising from the imperfect and endeavoring to reach
        Spirit above his origin. The stream rises no higher than
246:9   its source.

        The measurement of life by solar years robs youth and
        gives ugliness to age. The radiant sun of virtue and truth
246:12  coexists with being. Manhood is its eternal noon, un-
        dimmed by a declining sun. As the physical and mate-
        rial, the transient sense of beauty fades, the radiance of
246:15  Spirit should dawn upon the enraptured sense with bright
        and imperishable glories.

                           Undesirable records

        Never record ages. Chronological data are no part
246:18  of the vast forever. Time-tables of birth and death are
        so many conspiracies against manhood and
        womanhood. Except for the error of meas-
246:21  uring and limiting all that is good and beautiful, man
        would enjoy more than threescore years and ten and
        still maintain his vigor, freshness, and promise. Man,
246:24  governed by immortal Mind, is always beautiful and
        grand. Each succeeding year unfolds wisdom, beauty,
        and holiness.

                            True life eternal

246:27  Life is eternal. We should find this out, and begin the
        demonstration thereof. Life and goodness are immortal.
        Let us then shape our views of existence into
246:30  loveliness, freshness, and continuity, rather
        than into age and blight.

        Acute and chronic beliefs reproduce their own types.
247:1   The acute belief of physical life comes on at a remote
        period, and is not so disastrous as the chronic belief.

                         Eyes and teeth renewed

247:3   I have seen age regain two of the elements it had lost,
        sight and teeth. A woman of eighty-five, whom I knew,
        had a return of sight. Another woman at
247:6   ninety had new teeth, incisors, cuspids, bi-
        cuspids, and one molar. One man at sixty
        had retained his full set of upper and lower teeth without
247:9   a decaying cavity.

                             Eternal beauty

        Beauty, as well as truth, is eternal; but the beauty
        of material things passes away, fading and fleeting as
247:12  mortal belief. Custom, education, and fashion
        form the transient standards of mortals. Im-
        mortality, exempt from age or decay, has a glory of its
247:15  own, - the radiance of Soul. Immortal men and women
        are models of spiritual sense, drawn by perfect Mind
        and reflecting those higher conceptions of loveliness
247:18  which transcend all material sense.

                          The divine loveliness

        Comeliness and grace are independent of matter. Be-
        ing possesses its qualities before they are perceived hu-
247:21  manly. Beauty is a thing of life, which
        dwells forever in the eternal Mind and re-
        flects the charms of His goodness in expression, form,
247:24  outline, and color. It is Love which paints the petal
        with myriad hues, glances in the warm sunbeam, arches
        the cloud with the bow of beauty, blazons the night with
247:27  starry gems, and covers earth with loveliness.

        The embellishments of the person are poor substitutes
        for the charms of being, shining resplendent and eternal
247:30  over age and decay.

        The recipe for beauty is to have less illusion and
        more Soul, to retreat from the belief of pain or pleasure
248:1   in the body into the unchanging calm and glorious free-
        dom of spiritual harmony.

                            Love's endowment

248:3   Love never loses sight of loveliness. Its halo rests upon
        its object. One marvels that a friend can ever seem less
        than beautiful. Men and women of riper
248:6   years and larger lessons ought to ripen into
        health and immortality, instead of lapsing into darkness
        or gloom. Immortal Mind feeds the body with supernal
248:9   freshness and fairness, supplying it with beautiful images
        of thought and destroying the woes of sense which each
        day brings to a nearer tomb.

                            Mental sculpture

248:12  The sculptor turns from the marble to his model in
        order to perfect his conception. We are all sculptors,
        working at various forms, moulding and chisel-
248:15  ing thought. What is the model before mortal
        mind? Is it imperfection, joy, sorrow, sin, suffering?
        Have you accepted the mortal model? Are you repro-
248:18  ducing it? Then you are haunted in your work by vicious
        sculptors and hideous forms. Do you not hear from all
        mankind of the imperfect model? The world is holding
248:21  it before your gaze continually. The result is that you
        are liable to follow those lower patterns, limit your life-
        work, and adopt into your experience the angular outline
248:24  and deformity of matter models.

                             Perfect models

        To remedy this, we must first turn our gaze in the right
        direction, and then walk that way. We must form perfect
248:27  models in thought and look at them continually,
        or we shall never carve them out in grand and
        noble lives. Let unselfishness, goodness, mercy, justice,
248:30  health, holiness, love - the kingdom of heaven - reign
        within us, and sin, disease, and death will diminish until
        they finally disappear.

249:1   Let us accept Science, relinquish all theories based on
        sense-testimony, give up imperfect models and illusive
249:3   ideals; and so let us have one God, one Mind, and that
        one perfect, producing His own models of excellence.

                            Renewed selfhood

        Let the "male and female" of God's creating appear.
249:6   Let us feel the divine energy of Spirit, bringing us into
        newness of life and recognizing no mortal nor
        material power as able to destroy. Let us re-
249:9   joice that we are subject to the divine "powers that be."
        Such is the true Science of being. Any other theory of
        Life, or God, is delusive and mythological.

249:12  Mind is not the author of matter, and the creator of
        ideas is not the creator of illusions. Either there is no
        omnipotence, or omnipotence is the only power. God is
249:15  the infinite, and infinity never began, will never end, and
        includes nothing unlike God. Whence then is soulless
        matter?

                             Illusive dreams

249:18  Life is, like Christ, "the same yesterday, and to-day,
        and forever." Organization and time have nothing to do
        with Life. You say, "I dreamed last night."
249:21  What a mistake is that! The I is Spirit. God
        never slumbers, and His likeness never dreams. Mortals
        are the Adam dreamers.

249:24  Sleep and apath are phases of the dream that life, sub-
        stance, and intelligence are material. The mortal night-
        dream is sometimes nearer the fact of being than are the
249:27  thoughts of mortals when awake. The night-dream has
        less matter as its accompaniment. It throws off some
        material fetters. It falls short of the skies, but makes its
249:30  mundane flights quite ethereal.

                         Philosophical blunders

        Man is the reflection of Soul. He is the direct oppo-
        site of material sensation, and there is but one Ego. We
250:1   run into error when we divide Soul into souls, multiply
        Mind into minds and suppose error to be mind, then mind
250:3   to be in matter and matter to be a lawgiver,
        unintelligence to act like intelligence, and mor-
        tality to be the matrix of immortality.

                           Spirit the one Ego

250:6   Mortal existence is a dream; mortal existence has no
        real entity, but saith "It is I." Spirit is the Ego which
        never dreams, but understands all things;
250:9   which never errs, and is ever conscious; which
        never believes, but knows; which is never born and
        never dies. Spiritual man is the likeness of this Ego.
250:12  Man is not God, but like a ray of light which comes from
        the sun, man, the outcome of God, reflects God.

                        Mortal existence a dream

        Mortal body and mind are one, and that one is called
250:15  man; but a mortal is not man, for man is immortal. A
        mortal may be weary or pained, enjoy or suffer,
        according to the dream he entertains in sleep.
250:18  When that dream vanishes, the mortal finds himself
        experiencing none of these dream-sensations. To the
        observer, the body lies listless, undisturbed, and sensa-
250:21  tionless, and the mind seems to be absent.

        Now I ask, Is there any more reality in the waking
        dream of mortal existence than in the sleeping dream?
250:24  There cannot be, since whatever appears to be a mortal
        man is a mortal dream. Take away the mortal mind,
        and matter has no more sense as a man than it has as
250:27  a tree. But the spiritual, real man is immortal.

        Upon this stage of existence goes on the dance of mortal
        mind. Mortal thoughts chase one another like snowflakes,
250:30  and drift to the ground. Science reveals Life as not being
        at the mercy of death, nor will Science admit that happi-
        ness is ever the sport of circumstance.

                          Error self-destroyed

251:1   Error is not real, hence it is not more imperative
        as it hastens towards self-destruction. The so-called
251:3   belief of mortal mind apparent as an abscess
        should not grow more painful before it suppu-
        rates neither should a fever become more severe before
251:6   it ends.

                            Illusion of death

        Fright is so great at certain stages of mortal belief
        as to drive belief into new paths. In the illusion of
251:9   death, mortals wake to the knowledge of two
        facts: (1) that they are not dead; (2) that
        they have but passed the portals of a new belief. Truth
251:12  works out the nothingness of error in just these ways.
        Sickness, as well as sin, is an error that Christ, Truth,
        alone can destroy.

                       Mortal mind's disappearance

251:15  We must learn how mankind govern the body, -
        whether through faith in hygiene, in drugs, or in will-
        power. We should learn whether they govern
251:18  the body through a belief in the necessity of
        sickness and death, sin and pardon, or govern
        it from the higher understanding that the divine Mind
251:21  makes perfect, acts upon the so-called human mind
        through truth, leads the human mind to relinquish all
        error, to find the divine Mind to be the only Mind,
251:24  and the healer of sin, disease, death. This process of
        higher spiritual understanding improves mankind until
        error disappears, and nothing is left which deserves to
251:27  perish or to be punished.

                           Spiritual ignorance

        Ignorance, like intentional wrong, is not Science.
        Ignorance must be seen and corrected before we can at-
251:30  tain harmony. Inharmonious beliefs, which
        rob Mind, calling it matter, and deify their
        own notions, imprison themselves in what they create.
252:1   They are at war with Science, and as our Master said,
        "If a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom
252:3   cannot stand."

        Human ignorance of Mind and of the recuperative
        energies of Truth occasions the only skepticism regard-
252:6   ing the pathology and theology of Christian Science.

                         Eternal man recognized

        When false human beliefs learn even a little of their
        own falsity, they begin to disappear. A knowledge of
252:9   error and of its operations must precede that
        understanding of Truth which destroys error,
        until the entire mortal, material error finally disappears,
252:12  and the eternal verity, man created by and of Spirit,
        is understood and recognized as the true likeness of his
        Maker.

252:15  The false evidence of material sense contrasts strikingly
        with the testimony of Spirit. Material sense lifts its voice
