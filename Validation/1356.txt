  notched trees, snares for game, and needles for making nets, which
  showed plainly that the land was inhabited by human beings. Like
  Columbus, Cabot thought he was off the coast of China.

THE CABOT VOYAGES FORGOTTEN. Before the end of 1497 John Cabot was
  back in Bristol. It is almost certain that he and his son, Sebastian
  Cabot, made a second voyage to the new found lands in the following
  year. The Cabot voyages, however, were soon almost forgotten by the
  people of England.

THE NAMING OF THE NEW LANDS. Why was our country named America
  rather than Columbia or New India? Both the southern and northern
  continents which we call the Americas were named for Americus Vespucius
  rather than for Christopher Columbus. This seems the more strange since
  we know so little about the life of Americus. Americus Vespucius was
  born in Florence, Italy, and like many other young Italians of that day
  entered the service of neighboring countries. He went to Spain and
  accompanied several Spanish expeditions sent to explore the new
  continent which Columbus had discovered on his third voyage.

  Perhaps Americus went as a pilot; he certainly was not the leader in any
  expedition. But he seems to have written to his friends interesting
  accounts of what he had seen. In one of these letters Americus seems to
  have written boastfully of how he had found lands which might be called
  a new world. He said that the new continent was more populous and more
  full of animals than Europe, or Asia, or Africa, and that the climate
  was even more temperate and pleasant than any other region. This was
  clearly a new world.

WHY AMERICUS WAS REGARDED AS THE DISCOVERER OF AMERICA. The
  statement of Americus was scattered widely by the help of the newly
  invented printing press. It was written in Latin, and so could be read
  by the learned of all countries. They were impressed by the belief of
  Americus that he had seen a new world and not simply the Indies. This
  was especially true of men living outside of Spain who had heard little
  of Columbus or his discovery.

  Columbus for his part had written as if his great discovery was a way to
  the Indies and the finding of islands on the way thither less important.
  Besides, when he saw what we call South America he had no idea that it
  was a new world. The people of Europe either never knew that he had
  discovered the mainland or had forgotten it altogether. But they heard a
  great deal about Americus and his doings. It is not strange that
  Americus rather than Columbus was long regarded as the true discoverer
  of America.

TWO NAMES FOR THE NEW LANDS. Even then the new continent might not
  have been called America but for the suggestion of a young scholar of
  the time. Martin Waldseemueller, a professor of geography at the college
  of St. Die, now in eastern France, wrote a book on geography. In his
  description of the parts of the world unknown to the ancients, he
  suggested naming the continent stretching to the south for Americus.

  [Illustration: FACSIMILE Of the passage in the _Cosmographia
  Introductio_ (1507), by Martin Waldseemueller, in which the name of
  America is proposed for the New World.]


    The facsimile's transcription reads as follows:

    Nunc Vero et hae partes sunt latius lustratae, et alia quarta
    pars per Americum Vesputium (ut in sequentibus audietur) inventa
    est quam non video cur quis jure vetet ab Americo inventore
    sagacis ingenii viro Amerigen quasi Americi terram, sive Americam
    dicendam: cum et Europa et Asia a mulieribus sua sortita sint
    nomina. Ejus situm et gentis mores ex bis binis Americi
    navigationibus quae sequuntur liquide intelligidatur.


  Waldseemueller thought Americus had been the real discoverer of this
  continent. He said, "Now, indeed, as these regions are more widely
  explored, and another fourth part has been discovered by Americus
  Vespucius, I do not see why any one may justly forbid it to be named
  Amerige--that is, Americ's Land, from Americus, the discoverer."

  Others adopted Waldseemueller's suggestion and the name America came into
  general use outside of Spain. But the Spaniards continued to call all
  the new lands by the name which Columbus had given them--the Indies.
  America was at first the name for South America only, but later was also
  used by writers for the other continent which was soon found to the
  north. It was natural to distinguish the two continents as South and
  North America.

BALBOA. The successors of Columbus kept up a ceaseless search for
  the real Indies, but the more they explored the more they saw that a
  great continental barrier was lying across the sea passage to Asia. A
  few began to suspect that after all America was not a part of Asia.
  Vasco Nunez Balboa was one of these. Balboa was a planter who had
  settled in Espanola. He fell deeply into debt, and to escape his
  creditors had himself nailed up in a barrel and put aboard a vessel
  bound for the northern coast of South America. From there he went to the
  eastern border of Panama with a party of gold seekers. The Indians told
  him of a great sea and of an abundance of gold on its shores to be found
  a short distance across the isthmus. It is probable that the Indians
  wished to get rid of the Spaniards as neighbors.

  [Illustration: VASCO NUNEZ BALBOA]

BALBOA'S DISCOVERY OF THE PACIFIC. Balboa resolved to make a name
  for himself and to be the discoverer of the other sea. He set off in
  1513. The land is not more than forty-five miles wide at Panama, but it
  is almost impassable even to this day. For twenty-two days the hardy
  adventurers advanced through a forest, dense with thickets and tangled
  swamps and interlacing vines--so thick that for days the sun could not
  be seen--and over rough and slippery mountain-sides until they came to
  an open sea stretching off to the south and west. Balboa called it the
  South Sea, but it is usually called the Pacific Ocean, the name given it
  afterward.

  Balboa had made the important discovery that the barrier of land was
  comparatively narrow. This gave the impression that North America, too,
  was narrower than it proved to be, and the search for the passage to the
  Indies was pushed with greater vigor.

MAGELLAN. A Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, had really won the
  race begun by Prince Henry's navigators and Columbus for India, the land
  of cloves, pepper, and nutmegs. He had won in 1497 by going around the
  Cape of Good Hope. Another explorer, Ferdinand Magellan, finally,
  reached the Indies in a long westward voyage lasting two years, from
  1519 to 1521.

  [Illustration: FERDINAND MAGELLAN]

THE BEGINNING OF MAGELLAN'S VOYAGE. Magellan, himself a Portuguese,
  tried in vain like Columbus to persuade the king of Portugal to aid him
  in his project. He succeeded better in Spain, and sailed from there in
  1519 with a small fleet given him by the young king Charles. The five
  ships in his fleet were old and in bad repair, and the crews had been
  brought together from every nation. They sailed directly to South
  America, and spent the first year searching every inlet along the coast
  for a passage.

  [Illustration: THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN]

  They found that the natives of South America used for food vegetables
  that "looked like turnips and tasted like chestnuts." The Indians called
  them "patatas." In this way the potato, one of the great foods of
  to-day, was found by Europeans. A whole winter was passed on the cold
  and barren coast of Patagonia. Magellan called the natives "Patagones,"
  the word in his language meaning big feet, from the large foot-prints
  which they left on the sand.

THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN. Magellan finally found a strait, since
  named for him the Strait of Magellan, and sailed his ships through it
  amid the greatest dangers. The change from the rough waters of the
  strait to the calm sea beyond made the word Pacific or Peaceful Sea seem
  the most suitable name for the vast body of water which they
  had entered.

THE FIRST VOYAGE ACROSS THE PACIFIC. From the western coast of
  South America Magellan struck boldly out into the Pacific Ocean on his
  way to Asia. The crews suffered untold hardships. The very rats which
  overran the rotten ships became a luxurious article of food which only
  the more fortunate members of the crews could afford. The poorer seamen
  lived for days on the ox-hide strips which protected the masts. These
  were soaked in sea-water and roasted over the fire.

  Magellan was fortunate enough to chance upon the Isle of Guam, where
  plentiful supplies were obtained. He called the group of small islands,
  of which Guam is one, the Ladrones. This was his word for robbers, used
  because the natives were such robbers. The expedition discovered a group
  of islands afterwards called the Philippines. There Magellan fell in
  with traders from the Indies and knew that the remainder of the voyage
  would be through well-known seas and over a route frequently followed.
  Poor Magellan did not live to complete his remarkable voyage. He was
  killed in the Philippine Islands in a battle with the natives.

  [Illustration: AN OLD MAP OF THE NEW WORLD--1523 After
  Magellan's voyage, but before the exploration of North America had
  gone far]

  Only one of the five ships found its way through the Spice Islands,
  across the Indian Ocean, around the Cape of Good Hope, and so back to
  Spain; but this one carried home twenty-six tons of cloves, worth more
  than enough to pay the whole cost of the expedition. Such was the value
  of the trade Europe was so eagerly seeking.

WHAT MAGELLAN HAD SHOWN THE PEOPLE OF EUROPE. Magellan's voyage
  had, however, been a great event. Historians are agreed that it was the
  greatest voyage in the history of mankind. It had shown in a practical
  way that the earth is a globe, just as Columbus and other wise men had
  long taught, for a ship had sailed completely around it.

  But Magellan had also proved some things that they had not dreamed. He
  had shown that two great oceans instead of one lay between Europe and
  Asia; he had made clear that the Indies which the Spanish explorers had
  found, and which other people were beginning to call the Americas, were
  really a new world entirely separate from Asia, and not a part of Asia
  as Columbus had thought.


    QUESTIONS

    1. Why were the early American explorers disappointed at finding two
    continents between Europe and Asia?

    2. What land did John Cabot discover? Where did he think this land
    was? Why did the English people take little interest in this voyage?

    3. Why was our country named America? Do you think that Americus
    Vespucius deserved so great an honor? By what name did the Spaniards
    continue to call the new region? Why did the Spaniards have one name
    and the other Europeans another name for a long time?

    4. How did Balboa come to find the Pacific Ocean? Why did men search
    for a passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific more vigorously
    after Balboa's expedition?

    5. Why has Magellan's voyage been called the greatest one in
    history? What three things had Magellan shown the European world?

    EXERCISES

    1. Make out a list of the explorers mentioned in this chapter who
    helped in the discovery of the New World, and place opposite the
    name of each the name of the land he discovered.

    2. Trace Magellan's voyage on the map and make a list of the lands
    or countries he passed. Look at the map of North America on this old
    map, and at the one in mentioned Chapter XIX. How do you account for
    the queer shape of North America on the old map?

CHAPTER XVI


EARLY SPANISH EXPLORERS AND CONQUERORS ON THE MAINLAND

THE CIVILIZATION OF THE MEXICAN INDIANS. Early Spanish explorers on
  the coast of Mexico found the Indians of the mainland more highly
  civilized than the natives of the West Indies. Some of these, especially
  the Aztecs, lived in large villages or cities and were ruled by powerful
  chiefs or kings. They built to their gods huge stone temples with towers
  several stories in height.

  Their houses, quite unlike those of the other Indians the Spanish had
  seen, were made of stone or sun-dried brick and coated with hard white
  plaster. Some of them were of immense size and could hold many families.
  Doors had not been invented, but hangings of woven grass or matting of
  cotton served instead. Strings of shells which a visitor could rattle
  answered for door-bells.

  The streets of the towns were narrow, but were often paved with a sort
  of cement. Aqueducts in solid masonry somewhat like the old Roman
  aqueducts, although not so large, carried water from the neighboring
  hills for fountains and rude public baths.

  The women wove cotton and prepared clothing for their families. Workmen
  made ornaments of gold and copper, and utensils and dishes of pottery
  for every-day use. The people cultivated the fields around the cities,
  raising a great variety of foods, and even built ditches to carry water
  for irrigating the fields. All this was in striking contrast with the
  simple habits of the West Indians.

  [Illustration: AZTEC SACRIFICIAL STONE Now in the National
  Museum in the City of Mexico]

CRUEL CUSTOMS OF THE AZTECS. With all the good features of Mexican
  life, with all the superiority of the Mexicans over the other Indians,
  there was much that was hideous and cruel. The Aztecs, the most powerful
  tribes, were continually at war with their neighbors. They lived mainly
  upon the plunder of their enemies and the tribute which they took from
  those they had conquered. Like all Mexicans, they worshiped great ugly
  idols as gods and to these their priests offered part of the captives
  taken in war as human sacrifices.

SPANISH IDEAS OF MEXICO. The reports of the Aztec civilization and
  of the treasures of gold, mostly untrue, excited the interest and greed
  of the Spaniards. Mexico seemed like the China which Marco Polo had
  described, and might offer a chance of immense wealth for those who
  should conquer it. In truth, Mexican civilization did resemble that of
  Asia more than anything that the Spaniards had seen. Montezuma, a
  powerful chief or king of the Aztecs, lived somewhat like a Mongol
  Emperor of Persia or China.

  [Illustration: MONTEZUMA, THE LAST KING OF MEXICO After Montanus
  and Ogilby]

CORTES. In 1519 the governor of Cuba sent Hernando Cortes to
  explore and conquer Mexico. The expedition landed where Vera Cruz is now
  situated. The ships were then sunk in order to cut off all hope of
  retreat for the soldiers. "For whom but cowards," said Cortes, "were
  means of retreat necessary!" Cortes, with great skill, worked up the
  zeal of his soldiers to the fury of a religious crusade. All thought it
  a duty to destroy the idols they saw, to end the practice of offering
  human sacrifices, and to force the Christian religion upon the natives.

  The small army marched slowly inland towards the City of Mexico, which
  was the capital of Montezuma's kingdom. Cortes and his men had learned
  the Indian mode of fighting from ambush, and also how successfully to
  match cunning and treachery with those villagers who tried to prevent
  his invasion of their country.

HOW THE SPANIARDS AND THE AZTECS FOUGHT. The Mexican warriors,
  though they fought fiercely, were no match for the Spaniards. The
  Mexicans were experts with the bow and arrow, using arrows pointed with
  a hard kind of stone. They carried for hand-to-hand fighting a narrow
  club set with a double edge of razor-like stones, and wore a crude kind
  of armor made from quilted cotton. But such things were useless against
  Spanish bullets shot from afar.

  [Illustration: THE ARMOR OF CORTES After an engraving of the
  original in the National Museum, Madrid]

  The roaring cannon, the glittering steel swords, the thick armor and
  shining helmets, the prancing horses on which the Spanish leaders were
  mounted, gave the whole a strange, unearthly appearance to the
  simple-minded Indians. The story is told that the Mexicans believed that
  one of their gods had once floated out to sea, saying that, in the
  fulness of time, he would return with fair-skinned companions to begin
  again his rule over his people. Many Aztecs looked upon the coming of
  the white men as the return of this god and thought that resistance
  would be useless. Such natives sent presents, made their peace with
  Cortes, and so weakened the opposition to the conquerors.

CORTES IN PERIL. Cortes easily entered the City of Mexico, and
  forced Montezuma to resign. But here the natives attacked his army in
  such numbers that he had to retreat to escape capture. The Spaniards
  fled from the city at night amid the onslaught of the inhabitants
  fighting for their religion and their homes.

  [Illustration: CANNON OF THE TIME OF CORTES After Van Menken.
  There are in the naval museum at Annapolis guns captured in the Mexican
  War supposed to be those used by Cortes]

  The retreat cost the Spaniards terrible losses. Cortes started in the
  evening on the retreat with 1,250 soldiers, 6,000 Indian allies, and 80
  horses. There were left in the morning 500 soldiers, 2,000 allies, and
  20 horses. Cortes is said to have buried his face in his hands and wept
  for his lost followers, but he never wavered in his purpose of taking
  Mexico. He was able to defeat the Indians in the open country, and to
  return to the attack on the capital city.

CAPTURE OF THE CITY OF MEXICO. The siege which followed, lasting
  nearly three months, has rarely been matched in history for the bravery
  and suffering of the natives. The fighting was constant and terrible.
  The fresh water supply was cut off from the inhabitants in the city, and
  famine aided the invaders. At length the defenders were exhausted and
  Cortes entered. It had taken him two years to conquer the Aztecs. A
  greater task remained for him to do. He was to cleanse and rebuild the
  City of Mexico, make it a center of Spanish civilization, and Mexico a
  New Spain. By such work Cortes showed that he could be not only a great
  conqueror, but also an able ruler in time of peace.

  [Illustration: THE CITY OF MEXICO UNDER THE CONQUERORS
  From the engraving in the "Niewe Wereld" of Montanus]

PIZARRO. A few years after Cortes conquered Mexico a second army
  conquered another famous Indian kingdom. Francisco Pizarro commanded
  this expedition, which set out from Panama in 1531. Pizarro had been
  with Balboa at the discovery of the South Sea or Pacific Ocean, and,
  like his master, had become interested in the stories the Indians told
  of a rich kingdom far to the south. The golden kingdom which the Indians
  described was that of the Incas, who lived much as the Aztecs. The
  Spaniards called the region of the Incas the Biru country or, by
  softening the first letter, the Peru country, from Biru, who was a
  native Indian chieftain.
