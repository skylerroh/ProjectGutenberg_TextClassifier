only well-nigh driven foreign watchmaking companies out of America,
but it has shown that it can more than compete with them on their own
ground. This arises partly from the fact that it can turn out the best
work on a large scale, but also from the fact that the principle on
which it operates enables it to do all this economically. The
Waltham Company claims to have arrived at simplicity, uniformity, and
precision in the manufacture of watches, and the report of our judges
shows that its claim is well founded. One of its discoveries was that
a simple instrument, where simplicity is possible, will cost less and
be worth more than a complicated one. Another was that the making
of all instruments of the same grade exactly alike, so that the part
which belongs to one belongs to the whole, will not only facilitate
manufacture, but will greatly economize it. A third was, that
these properties of simplicity and interchangeability are the best
guarantees of perfect exactitude. The success which the Americans have
reached in this as well as in other branches of industry, ought
to excite the gratitude rather than the jealousy of the world. Any
company or nation that shows how a maximum of efficiency can be
reached by a minimum of labor confers a benefit on mankind. This
our American cousins have done in other spheres besides that of
watchmaking. There are branches of the prosperity of the Americans
that are traceable to the extent of their territory and the fertility
of their soil; but the triumph of their machinery has been the result
of their inventiveness and of their enterprise, and for that reason it
points a moral that Australians might profitably observe."

A REMARKABLE LITTLE STEAMER.

There is soon to set sail from London for New York a new and
remarkable little steamer of 70 tons gross burden, named the
Anthracite, designed to exhibit the advanced engineering ideas of
Mr. Loftus Perkins, of England. The distinctive peculiarities of this
steamer are the very high steam pressure that she carries--350 to 500
lb. to the square inch, and the small consumption of fuel--one pound
of coal per hour per horsepower. A trial trip of this new little boat
was lately made of 46 miles, during which 350 lb. steam pressure was
steadily maintained, 132 revolutions per minute of propeller, and a
speed of eight knots per hour. Other vessels, some of larger size than
the above, have been built on the Perkins system, and are running
in England. One of them, the yacht Emily, carries 500 lb. boiler
pressure. Most of our readers are familiar with Mr. Perkins' system,
which has been fully described in our columns. Those who may wish to
refer thereto are directed to an interesting article by Mr. Perkins,
with engravings, published in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT, No.
81, July 21, 1877; also to the description of the steam ferry boat,
run on this principle, given with three pages of engravings in our
SUPPLEMENT No. 217.

Engineering theory and practice have for a long time plainly pointed
to high steam pressures as one of the surest ways to economy of fuel.
Twenty five years ago our ocean steamers carried only 16 lb. pressure
to the inch, and burned 5 to 6 lb. of coal per hour per horse power.
To-day they are carrying 75 lb. pressure, and burning 21/2 to 3 lb. of
coal per hour per horse power.

In 1840 the Britannia, one of the finest steamers of the Cunard line
plying between this country and England, burned 5,291 lb. of coal for
each ton of paying freight she carried, her speed, then considered
fast, being 81/2 knots per hour. In 1877 the Britannic, speed 15.6 knots
per hour, burned only 551 lb. of coal per ton of freight carried.

Although our present steamers are making fast time and are very
economical as compared with earlier vessels, still it is a lamentable
fact that on the largest and finest of them, furnished with all the
latest improvements and best appliances to secure economy, worked by
the most careful and intelligent engineers, we succeed in putting
into our steam only about one tenth of the heat realized in our
boiler fire, the remaining nine-tenths of the heat being lost. Only in
proportion as we make our steam hotter, and expanding it more, shall
we economize in fuel. In this respect the voyage of the Anthracite is
designed by her owners, we presume, to be an eye-opener for steamboat
owners, not only in this country but throughout the world. If a little
bit of a boat like this, 84 feet long, 16 feet beam, and 10 feet deep,
can carry its own coal and water across the Atlantic, with a pressure
of 350 to 500 lb. to the inch, and on one pound of coal per horse
power, the natural inference is that our great steamers, when fitted
with the same system, will realize far better results. The change from
three pounds of coal to one pound per horse power means a shaving of
two thirds in the coal bill, which is always an enormous item in the
expenses of large boats. We ought to add that another peculiarity of
the Anthracite is that she uses the same boiler water over and over,
only a trifle of fresh water being supplied to make good the slight
waste. Our New York steamboat men, who have to pay so dear for Croton
water, will be likely to examine the water tank of the Anthracite with
interest.

A STRANGE EPIDEMIC.

On the night of Tuesday, June 15, a remarkable epidemic fell upon
several towns in western Massachusetts, the town of Adams
suffering most severely. Out of a population of 6,000, several
hundred--variously estimated from 600 to over 1,000--were prostrated
by a disease resembling cholera morbus. The symptoms were first
dizziness, then great nausea, followed by vomiting and prolonged
purging, and in some cases delirium. A belt of country two or three
miles in width and several miles long was thus afflicted, beginning at
the west, the whole number of victims being estimated at from 1,200 to
1,500. No deaths are reported.

The cause of the epidemic is not known, but seems most likely to have
been atmospheric. For some time the weather had been dry and hot.
A heavy local rain fell during the evening, and was followed by or
attended with a sudden and great lowering of the temperature. A chilly
fog hung over the belt of country invaded by the disease, and a heavy
"swampy" odor and taste were in the air.

The malady reached its climax in about twenty-four hours. It was first
suspected that the water supply had been somehow poisoned, but many
people who had not used the water were prostrated, while others
who used it freely escaped. Adams has hitherto been regarded as an
exceptionally healthy town, and the surrounding country is high and
wholesome.

CANNONADING OF OIL TANKS.

On the morning of Friday, June 11, lightning struck an oil tank
belonging to the Tidioute and Titusville Pipe Line, at Titusville,
Pa. The fire thus kindled, raged until Sunday night, consuming 200,000
barrels of oil, crude and refined, and destroying property to the
amount of $1,500,000. The most appalling feature in this fire was the
successive "boiling over" of oil from burning tanks of the liquid.
To empty rapidly a tank containing 20,000 barrels of oil, while the
latter is on fire, is no easy matter. The pipes connected with the
tanks were utterly inadequate to remove the oil rapidly enough to rob
the "boiling over" of its terrors. A happy thought suggested itself
on Friday to Mr. D. R. Herron, of the Titusville Battery. Obtaining
permission, Mr. Herron brought out one of the Parrott guns of the
battery, loaded it with solid shot, and began firing against the
three-eighths iron sheets of the distant blazing tank. The first
shot glanced, but subsequent volleys pierced the shell of the tank,
releasing a large quantity of oil that otherwise would have fed the
flames. The battery then moved on to the Emery tank, also burning, and
lastly to the Acme tank. Large rents were made in all these, and the
liberated oil ran harmlessly down into a stream. This novel target
practice greatly shortened the duration of the fire at these tanks,
and so drained them that the flames died out for want of fuel, and no
"boiling over" resulted.

The peculiar attraction for lightning which these iron oil tanks
appear to possess has been several times referred to in our columns.
Whenever a thunderstorm passes fairly over one of them it seems to be
devoted to destruction. Millions of dollars' worth of property have
thus been destroyed. No practical safeguard has yet been suggested.

Ordinary buildings, when properly provided with rods that are
well grounded in the earth, are comparatively safe from lightning.
Structures made of iron and simply resting upon the earth, without
rods, are also exempt from electrical damage. Such structures always
present a continuous body of conducting material for the free passage
of electricity to earth. Why is it, then, that iron oil tanks form
such conspicuous exceptions to our common experience with lightning?
Rods put on other structures save them; but rods have been put on oil
tanks, masts with rods have surrounded the tanks, but the tanks were
exploded by lightning all the same.

We will repeat a possible explanation which we have heretofore given.
From every oil tank, according to our theory, there is a constant
escape of light hydrocarbon vapor, which forms a permanent cloud or
column, rising to a great height above the tanks, far above any
rod that could be erected. This vapor rod is a conductor, which the
lightning naturally follows, sets on fire the vapor, and explodes the
tank.

A column of heated air or vapor rising from a chimney is well known
to be a conductor for lightning; the rise of hydrocarbon vapors is
illustrated by the balloon.

If the theory we have outlined is correct, the remedy for the
electrical explosion of oil tanks is to be found in such a treatment
of the oil, or such a construction of tank, as shall prevent any
escape of the light vapors.

NAVIGATION IN FOGS.

The disastrous collision of the Sound steamers Narragansett and
Stonington was quickly followed by one at sea, by which two great
passenger ships escaped instant destruction almost by a hair's
breadth.

Shortly after noon, Monday, June 12, the National Line steamship
Queen, bound from London to New York, and within 300 miles of her
journey's end, ran into the Anchor Line steamship Anchoria, on the way
from New York to Glasgow. The bow of the Queen struck the Anchoria on
the port side, about twenty feet abaft the foremast, smashing a great
hole through the iron hull. Two compartments of the Anchoria filled
immediately, but the partitions stood firm, and the other compartments
sufficed to keep the vessel afloat. The bow of the Queen was badly
crushed, and her forward compartment was flooded. Fortunately the
bulkhead proved stanch, and the ship was saved. The fog was very
thick, and both ships were going at full speed. It is said that the
captain of the Anchoria mistook the whistle of the Queen for that of
the Anchoria's companion vessel, the Victoria, which left New York at
the same time, and was probably not far away, and before the error was
discovered the ships were too close to avoid the catastrophe. Had the
sea been rough or the partitions less stanch, both ships must have
gone to the bottom almost instantly.

The passengers of the Anchoria were transferred to the Queen, which
was least hurt, and the two ships sailed together for New York,
arriving Tuesday noon.

These two collisions, coming in such quick succession and imperiling
so many lives, give terrible emphasis to the dangers attending
navigation in foggy weather. They make very pertinent also the query
whether the means now employed for discovering the position
and nearness of unseen vessels are at all commensurate with the
necessities of the case, or with the means already known, and known
to be well calculated to prevent such dangers. In a dense fog the
ordinary ship's light is visible scarcely more than a ship's length;
and as it proved in the case of the Narragansett and Stonington, the
time between thus sighting an approaching vessel and the instant of
collision is fatally brief. The recent test of electric headlights
for ships in this harbor clearly demonstrated the possibility of
projecting a beam of electric light through the densest fog for a
thousand feet or more, and through ordinary fogs a distance several
times as great.

Except in very rough weather the steam whistle can be heard a long
distance, but it is liable to be a treacherous guide. It is not always
possible to determine by the ear alone the direction from which a
sound comes; and it would seem that a mistake of this nature was made
on the Stonington, since the order intended to change her course
away from that of the Narragansett only served to precipitate the
collision. Had the whistle of the Queen signaled her course it could
not have been mistaken for that of a ship sailing in the opposite
direction, and the safety of two great floating hotels and their
occupants would not have been imperiled thereby.

Means for the better penetration of fogs, for determining the
direction of unseen sources of sounds, and for enabling steamers to
announce to all within hearing the course they are pursuing, seem
therefore to be imperative necessities on shipboard. The first is
furnished by the electric headlight, with a system of projection
similar to but more efficient than that used on locomotives. The last
would be provided by an efficient code of whistle signals to indicate
the several points of compass. The second need is supplied by the
instrument figured in the accompanying illustration.

[Illustration: PROFESSOR MAYER'S TOPOPHONE.]

The aim of the topophone, which was invented and patented by Professor
A. M. Mayer, last winter, is to enable the user to determine quickly
and surely the exact direction and position of any source of sound.
Our figure shows a portable style of the instrument; for use
on ship-board it would probably form one of the fixtures of the
pilot-house or the "bridge," or both. In most cases arising in sailing
through fogs, it would be enough for the captain or pilot to be
sure of the exact direction of a fog horn, whistling buoy, or steam
whistle; and for this a single aural observation suffices.

Every one has twirled a tuning fork before the ear, and listened to
the alternate swelling and sinking of the sound, as the sound waves
from one tine re-enforce or counteract those from the other tine. The
topophone is based upon the same fact, namely, the power of any sound
to augment or destroy another of the same pitch, when ranged so that
the sound waves of each act in unison with or in opposition to those
of the other.

Briefly described, the topophone consists of two resonators (or any
other sound receivers) attached to a connecting bar or shoulder rest.
The sound receivers are joined by flexible tubes, which unite for part
of their length, and from which ear tubes proceed. One tube, it will
be observed, carries a telescopic device by which its length can be
varied. When the two resonators face the direction whence a sound
comes, so as to receive simultaneously the same sonorous impulse, and
are joined by tubes of equal length, the sound waves received from
them will necessarily re-enforce each other and the sound will be
augmented. If, on the contrary, the resonators being in the same
position as regards the source of sound, the resonator tubes differ in
length by half the wave length of the sound, the impulse from the one
neutralizes that from the other, and the sound is obliterated.

Accordingly, in determining the direction of the source of any sound
with this instrument, the observer, guided by the varying intensity
of the sound transmitted by the resonators, turns until their
openings touch the same sound waves simultaneously, which position
he recognizes either by the great augmentation of the sound (when the
tube lengths are equal), or by the cessation of the sound, when the
tubes vary so that the interference of the sound waves is perfect. In
either case the determination of the direction of the source of the
sound is almost instantaneous, and the two methods may be successively
employed as checks upon each other's report.

It is obvious that with such a help the pilot in a fog need never be
long in doubt as to the direction of a warning signal; and if need
be he can without much delay, by successive observations and a little
calculation, determine, approximately at least, the distance of the
sounding body.

EFFECT OF AGE ON THE QUALITY OF IRON.

Professor Bauschinger, in 1878, tested iron taken from a chain bridge
built in 1829, and found that fifty years of use had not perceptibly
altered its quality--either its strength or its elasticity--as
reported at the time of its erection. He also examined metal from
another bridge built in 1852, and found that the average quality
remained as given by Von Pauli at the time of its erection.

Professor Thurston, testing pieces of the wire cable of the Fairmount
Suspension Bridge, recently taken down at Philadelphia, after about
forty years' use, found the iron to have a tenacity and elasticity
and a ductility fully equal to the best wire of same size found in the
market to-day.

He therefore concludes that iron subjected to strains such as are met
with in properly designed bridges does not deteriorate with age.

A COLLISION BETWEEN LARGE PASSENGER STEAMERS.

During a fog near midnight, June 11, two of the large passenger
steamers plying on Long Island Sound, Stonington line, between New
York and Boston, came in collision, while running at considerable
speed. One of the boats, the Narragansett, was struck near the middle,
her side cut open, and a smoke-pipe knocked over, which made a down
draught through the furnace, driving out a great sheet of burning
gas into the cabins and between decks, by which the vessel was set on
fire, at the same time the opening in her side caused her to begin
to sink. Some three hundred passengers were on board, and a frightful
scene of confusion followed. Happily there was a plentiful supply
of life-preservers, some life-rafts, and a few life-boats. There was
delay in lowering the boats, but the rafts, life-preservers, chairs,
and other floatables served to support most of the unfortunate people,
who, to escape the flames, were obliged to leap quickly into the
water. About fifty lives were lost; the remainder were rescued by
boats from another steamer, the New York, also by help sent from the
other damaged vessel, the Stonington.

It seems remarkable that so many were saved. This calamity illustrates
the necessity for further effort on the part of inventors to discover
new and improved means for fog signaling, saving life, preventing the
spread of fires, and keeping vessels afloat. Most of the large local
steamers that communicate with New York are veritable palaces,
built regardless of expense, and supplied with every known reliable
appliance for safety; but the occurrence of accidents like this and
their disastrous results show that much remains to be done before
navigation, even upon smooth waters, can be considered secure.

The life-rafts of the Narragansett seem to have proved more useful
than the life-boats in rescuing the drowning people, the rafts being
more quickly and easily launched, requiring less skill, etc.

The upperworks of our river and Sound passenger steamers consist at
present of a mass of light, dry woodwork, forming cabins that are very
comfortable and commodious for travelers, but highly dangerous in case
of fire.

The collision of river steamers above described was followed a few
hours later by a collision between two great ocean steamers, accounts
of which we give in another column.

HONORS TO AN AGED CHEMIST.

The chemists of Germany are collecting money for the purpose of
presenting a gold medal to Prof. Woehler on his eightieth birthday,
which will be July 31, 1880. Prof. Woehler is one of the most
distinguished as well as the oldest of living chemists. Himself
a pupil of old Berzelius, a contemporary of Liebig, and the loved
instructor of many of our best chemists, his name is equally respected
on both sides of the Atlantic. Profs. Jay and Chandler, of Columbia
College, New York city, two of his former pupils, are receiving
contributions from those who wish to join in this well deserved
memorial.

PERSEVERANCE UNDER DIFFICULTIES.

A good lesson to young people inclined to exaggerate the hinderances
to their success in life, and to think that their chances are too poor
to justify honest exertion, is furnished by a young colored man of
Columbus, Ohio, F. P. Williams by name, now serving in that city as
census enumerator. Several years ago he was run over by a train of
cars, his arms being so mutilated that both had to be taken off near
the shoulder. Lacking hands he learned to write legibly by holding his
pencil between his teeth. He writes quite rapidly, and in his work as
enumerator takes an average of 200 names a day.

escape through the jet, L. This produces a partial vacuum at L, and
draws air in at C. The air and steam pass with great rapidity through
the tube, G. The action of the air and steam produces another
partial vacuum at N, which draws gasoline in through the pipe, B. The
adjustment of the opening is such that one pound of steam draws in air
sufficient for two pounds of gasoline. The heat of the steam is taken
up by the refrigeration caused by the evaporation of the gasoline, so
that at E the compound is carbureted air and cold water. The tube, F,
presents the curious phenomenon of being hot at _a_ and cold at _b_.
In one short piece of tube we have a hot retort and a cold condenser.
The supply of gasoline is regulated by the valve, D. The dash pot,
H, prevents a too rapid action of the valve, I. Gas of any desired
density may be made, and when once adjusted the gas does not vary. The
burner used with this machine is made to produce the very best results
attainable, and then the gas is regulated to a density and pressure
to suit the burner. The nuisance of an adjustable burner is thus
obviated.

The holder closes off the supply when full, and lets on a supply when
nearly empty. Gasoline has been much improved within a few years. It
is now so very cheap that the equivalent of one thousand feet of coal
gas of standard quality may be equaled for sixty cents. Where no steam
is at hand these machines are run with a small oil burner. They are
being made by the Pennsylvania Globe Gas Light Co., 131 Arch St.,
Philadelphia, Pa., of from 100 to 10,000 burner power.

This machine was patented June 8, 1880.

PREVENTION OF BOILER EXPLOSIONS.

This vexed problem has occupied the minds of engineers and inventors
since the introduction of steam as a motive power, and there are
several theories of boiler explosions, each having its adherents. Of
course there are conditions under which a boiler explosion is involved
in no mystery; as, for example, when the water is dangerously low,
when the safety valve is of insufficient capacity, or when it is
unduly loaded; but there are other cases where an explosion cannot be
rationally explained in the light of the well known theories.

Mr. Daniel T. Lawson, of Wellsville, Ohio, has recently patented,
in this and several other countries, a device for preventing boiler
explosions, which appears practical, and according to the testimony of
scientific men the claims of the inventor are well founded.

The inventor, in explaining his invention, says that when water
is superheated it becomes as explosive as gunpowder, exploding by
bursting into steam from a reduction of pressure. When the engineer
opens the throttle valve the cylinder is instantly filled with steam,
creating a vacuum to that extent in the boiler. The superheated water
then immediately rises to fill the vacuum, and is met by the valve,
instantly cutting off the escape into the cylinder; this causes a
concussion on every square inch in the boiler much greater than the
regular pressure of the steam. There is abundant reason to believe
that it is this concussive action which causes the numerous and
mysterious boiler explosions, and which cause is wholly independent of
the amount of water in the boiler; in fact, the greater the amount of
water in the boiler the more terrific the explosion.

This invention, which is based upon this theory, consists in reducing
the concussive strain produced by the impulsive and intermittent
escape of steam to the cylinders to an approximately uniform pressure,
by rendering the evolution or passage of steam from the water to the
steam space approximately constant and independent of the intermittent
discharges from the steam space to the cylinder. The means for
accomplishing this consist in a boiler constructed with a partition,
A, intervening between the water space and the space from which the
steam is taken to supply the cylinder, and feeding the steam as it
is generated through valves or orifices, B, in the partition, of a
smaller size than the port or opening through which the steam passes
into the cylinder. By this means the normal steam pressure or steam
supply, when thus intermittently or alternately reduced, is restored
gradually by reducing the flow from the water space to the steam
space, so that the transformation of water into steam is made
approximately uniform in spite of the intermittent escape of steam
through the cylinders, and the boiler is thus relieved of the constant
wear and strain of the concussion.

[Illustration: LAWSON'S IMPROVED STEAM BOILER.]

In supplying steam from the water compartment to the steam
compartment, the inventor intends using a number of small
perforations, not amounting in the aggregate to more than about one
twentieth the size of the cylinder port, in connection with a number
