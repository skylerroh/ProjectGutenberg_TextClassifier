Teething Ring

By JAMES CAUSEY

[Illustration: Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS]


 _Anyone can make an error, but the higher the
 society ... the more disastrous the mistake!_


Half an hour before, while she had been engrossed in the current soap
opera and Harry Junior was screaming in his crib, Melinda would
naturally have slammed the front door in the little man's face. However,
when the bell rang, she was wearing her new Chinese red housecoat, had
just lustered her nails to a blinding scarlet, and Harry Junior was
sleeping like an angel.

Yawning, Melinda answered the door and the little man said, beaming,
"Excellent day. I have geegaws for information."

Melinda did not quite recoil. He was perhaps five feet tall, with a
gleaming hairless scalp and a young-old face. He wore a plain gray
tunic, and a peddler's tray hung from his thin shoulders.

"Don't want any," Melinda stated flatly.

"_Please._" He had great, beseeching amber eyes. "They all say that. I
haven't much time. I must be back at the University by noon."

"You working your way through college?"

He brightened. "Yes. I suppose you could call it that. Alien
anthropology major."

Melinda softened. The initiations those frats pulled nowadays--shaving
the poor guy's head, eating goldfish--it was criminal.

"Well?" she asked grudgingly. "What's in the tray?"
