    Who followed treason's banner, or forswore
    Their plighted oath to masters, here remain,
And, pent in dungeons deep, await their doom of pain.

LXXXII. "Ask not what pain; what fortune or what fate
    O'erwhelmed them, nor their torments seek to know.
    These roll uphill a rock's enormous weight,
    Those, hung on wheels, are racked with endless woe.
    There, too, for ever, as the ages flow,
    Sad Theseus sits, and through the darkness cries
    Unhappy Phlegyas to the shades below,
    'Learn to be good; take warning and be wise;
Learn to revere the gods, nor heaven's commands despise.'

LXXXIII. "There stands the traitor, who his country sold,
    A tyrant's bondage for his land prepared;
    Made laws, unmade them, for a bribe of gold.
    With lawless lust a daughter's shame he shared;
    All dared huge crimes, and compassed what they dared.
    Ne'er had a hundred mouths, if such were mine,
    Nor hundred tongues their endless sins declared,
    Nor iron voice their torments could define,
Or tell what doom to each the avenging gods assign.

LXXXIV. "But haste we," adds the Sibyl; "onward hold
    The way before thee, and thy task pursue.
    Forged in the Cyclops' furnaces, behold
    Yon walls and fronting archway, full in view.
    Leave there thy gift and pay the God his due."
    She spake, and thither through the dark they paced,
    And reached the gateway. He, with lustral dew
    Self-sprinkled, seized the entrance, and in haste
High o'er the fronting door the fateful offering placed.

LXXXV. These dues performed, they reach the realms of rest,
    Fortunate groves, where happy souls repair,
    And lawns of green, the dwellings of the blest.
    A purple light, a more abundant air
    Invest the meadows. Sun and stars are there,
    Known but to them. There rival athletes train
    Their practised limbs, and feats of strength compare.
    These run and wrestle on the sandy plain,
Those tread the measured dance, and join the song's sweet strain.

LXXXVI. In flowing robes the Thracian minstrel sings,
    Sweetly responsive to the seven-toned lyre;
    Fingers and quill alternate wakes the strings.
    Here Teucer's race, and many an ancient sire,
    Chieftains of nobler days and martial fire,
    Ilus, high-souled Assaracus, and he
    Who founded Troy, the rapturous strains admire,
    And arms afar and shadowy cars they see,
And lances fixt in earth, and coursers grazing free.

LXXXVII. The love of arms and chariots, the care
    Their glossy steeds to pasture and to train,
    That pleased them living, still attends them there:
    These, stretched at ease, lie feasting on the plain;
    There, choral companies, in gladsome strain,
    Chant the loud Paean, in a grove of bay,
    Rich in sweet scents, whence hurrying to the main,
    Eridanus' full torrent on its way
Rolls from below through woods majestic to the day.

LXXXVIII. There, the slain patriot, and the spotless sage,
    And pious poets, worthy of the God;
    There he, whose arts improved a rugged age,
    And those who, labouring for their country's good,
    Lived long-remembered,--all, in eager mood,
    Crowned with white fillets, round the Sibyl pressed;
    Chiefly Musaeus; in the midst he stood,
    With ample shoulders towering o'er the rest,
When thus the listening crowd the prophetess addressed:

LXXXIX. "Tell, happy souls; and thou, great poet, tell
    Where--in what place--Anchises doth abide,
    For whom we came and crossed the streams of Hell."
    Briefly the venerable chief replied:
    "Fixt home hath no one; by the streamlet's side,
    Or in dark groves, or dewy meads we stray,
    Where living waters through the pastures glide.
    Mount, if ye list, and I will point the way,
Yon summit, and beneath the shining fields survey."

XC. Thus on he leads them, till they leave the height,
    Rejoicing.--In a valley far away
    The sire Anchises scanned, with fond delight,
    The prisoned souls, who waited for the day.
    Their shape, their mien his studious eyes survey;
    Their fates and fortunes he reviews with pride,
    And counts his future offspring in array.
    Now, when his son advancing he espied,
Aloud, with tearful eyes and outspread hands, he cried:

XCI. "Art thou, then, come at last? Has filial love,
    Thrice welcome, braved the perils of the way?
    O joy! do I behold thee? hear thee move
    Sweet converse as of old? 'Tis come, the day
    I longed and looked for, pondering the delay,
    And counting every moment, nor in vain.
    How tost with perils do I greet thee? yea,
    What wanderings thine on every land and main!
What dangers did I dread from Libya's tempting reign!"

XCII. "Father, 'twas thy sad image," he replied,
    "Oft-haunting, drove me to this distant place.
    Our navy floats on the Tyrrhenian tide.
    Give me thy hand, nor shun a son's embrace."
    So spake the son, and o'er his cheeks apace
    Rolled down soft tears, of sadness and delight.
    Thrice he essayed the phantom to embrace;
    Thrice, vainly clasped, it melted from his sight,
Swift as the winged wind, or vision of the night.

XCIII. Meanwhile he views, deep-bosomed in a dale,
    A grove, and brakes that rustle in the breeze,
    And Lethe, gliding through the peaceful vale.
    Peoples and tribes, all hovering round, he sees,
    Unnumbered, as in summer heat the bees
    Hum round the flowerets of the field, to drain
    The fair, white lilies of their sweets; so these
    Swarm numberless, and ever and again
The gibbering ghosts disperse, and murmur o'er the plain.

XCIV. Awe-struck, AEneas would the cause enquire:
    What streams are yonder? what the crowd so great,
    That filled the river's margin? Then the Sire
    Anchises answered: "They are souls, that wait
    For other bodies, promised them by Fate.
    Now, by the banks of Lethe here below,
    They lose the memory of their former state,
    And from the silent waters, as they flow,
Drink the oblivious draught, and all their cares forego.

XCV. "Long have I wished to show thee, face to face,
    Italia's sons, that thou might'st joy with me
    To hail the new-found country of our race."
    "Oh father!" said AEneas, "can it be,
    That souls sublime, so happy and so free,
    Can yearn for fleshly tenements again?
    So madly long they for the light?" Then he:
    "Learn, son, and listen, nor in doubt remain."
And thus in ordered speech the mystery made plain:

XCVI. "First, Heaven and Earth and Ocean's liquid plains,
    The Moon's bright globe and planets of the pole,
    One mind, infused through every part, sustains;
    One universal, animating soul
    Quickens, unites and mingles with the whole.
    Hence man proceeds, and beasts, and birds of air,
    And monsters that in marble ocean roll;
    And fiery energy divine they share,
Save what corruption clogs, and earthly limbs impair.

XCVII. "Hence Fear and Sorrow, hence Desire and Mirth;
    Nor can the soul, in darkness and in chains,
    Assert the skies, and claim celestial birth.
    Nay, after death, the traces it retains
    Of fleshly grossness, and corporeal stains,
    Since much must needs by long concretion grow
    Inherent. Therefore are they racked with pains,
    And schooled in all the discipline of woe;
Each pays for ancient sin with punishment below.

XCVIII. "Some hang before the viewless winds to bleach;
    Some purge in fire or flood the deep decay
    And taint of wickedness. We suffer each
    Our ghostly penance; thence, the few who may,
    Seek the bright meadows of Elysian day,
    Till long, long years, when our allotted time
    Hath run its orbit, wear the stains away,
    And leave the aetherial sense, and spark sublime,
Cleansed from the dross of earth, and cankering rust of crime.

XCIX. "These, when a thousand rolling years are o'er,
    Called by the God, to Lethe's waves repair;
    There, reft of memory, to yearn once more
    For mortal bodies and the upper air."
    So spake Anchises, and the priestess fair
    Leads, with his son, the murmuring shades among,
    Where thickest crowd the multitude, and there
    They mount a hillock, and survey the throng,
And scan the pale procession, as it winds along.

C.  "Come, now, and hearken to the Dardan's fame,
    What noble grandsons shall Italia grace,
    Proud spirits, heirs of our illustrious name,
    And learn the fates and future of thy race.
    See yon fair youth, now leaning--mark his face--
    Upon a pointless spear, by lot decreed
    To stand the nearest to the light in place,
    He first shall rise, of mixt Italian breed,
Silvius, an Alban name, the youngest of thy seed.

CI. "Him, latest offspring of thy days' decline,
    Thy spouse Lavinia in the woods shall rear,
    The kingly parent of a kingly line,
    The lords of Alba Longa. Procas, dear
    To Trojans, Capys, Numitor are here,
    And he, whose surname shall revive thine own.
    Silvius AEneas, like his great compeer
    Alike for piety and arms well known,
If e'er, by Fate's decree, he mount the Alban throne.

CII. "What youths! what strength! what promise of renown!
    Behold the wreaths of civic oak they wear.
    First founders these of many a glorious town,
    Nomentum, Gabii and Fidenae fair;
    They on the mountain pinnacles shall rear
    Collatia's fortress, and Pometii found,
    The camp of Inuus, which foemen fear,
    Bola and Cora, names to be renowned,
Albeit inglorious now, for nameless is the ground.

CIII. "See Romulus, beside his grandsire's shade,
    Offspring of Mars and Ilia, and the line
    Of old Assaracus. See there displayed,
    The double crest upon his helm, the sign,
    Stamped by his sire, to mark his birth divine.
    Henceforth, beneath his auspices, shall rise
    That Rome, whose glories through the world shall shine;
    Far as wide earth's remotest boundary lies,
Her empire shall extend her genius to the skies.

CIV. "Seven hills her single rampart shall embrace,
    Seven citadels her girdling wall contain,
    Thrice blest, beyond all cities, in a race
    Of heroes, destined to adorn her reign.
    So, with a hundred grandsons in her train,
    Thrice blest, the Mother of the Gods, whose shrine
    Is Berecynthus, rides the Phrygian plain,
    Tower-crowned, the queen of an immortal line,
All habitants of heaven, and all of seed divine.

CV. "See now thy Romans; thither bend thine eyes,
    And Caesar and Iulus' race behold,
    Waiting their destined advent to the skies.
    This, this is he--long promised, oft foretold--
    Augustus Caesar. He the Age of Gold,
    God-born himself, in Latium shall restore,
    And rule the land, that Saturn ruled of old,
    And spread afar his empire and his power
To Garamantian tribes, and India's distant shore.

CVI. "Beyond the planets his dominions lie,
    Beyond the solar circuit of the year,
    Where Atlas bears the starry-spangled sky.
    E'en now the realms of Caspia shuddering hear
    His coming, made by oracles too clear.
    E'en now Maeotia trembles at his tread,
    And Nile's seven mouths are troubled, as in fear
    She shrinks reluctant to the deep, such dread
Hath seized the wondering world, so far his fame hath spread.

CVII. "So much of earth not Hercules of yore
    O'erpassed, though he the brass-hoofed hind laid low,
    And forth from Erymanthus drove the boar,
    And startled Lerna's forest with his bow;
    Nor he, the Wine-God, who in conquering show,
    With vine-wreathed reins, and tigers to his car,
    Rides down from Nysa to the plains below.
    And doubt we then to celebrate so far
Our prowess, and shall fear Ausonian fields debar?

CVIII. "But see, who, crowned with olive wreath, doth bring
    The sacred vessels? By his long, grey hair
    And grizzled beard I know the Roman King,
    Whom Fate from lowly Cures calls to bear
    The mighty burden of an empire's care,
    In peace the fabric of our laws to frame.
    Now, Tullus comes, new triumphs to prepare,
    And wake the folk to arm from idlesse fame,
And Ancus courts e'en now the popular acclaim.

CIX. "Would'st thou behold the Tarquins? Yonder stands
    Great Brutus, the Avenger, proud to tear
    The people's fasces from the tyrant's hands.
    First Consul, he the dreaded axe shall bear,
    The patriot-father, who for freedom fair
    Shall call his own rebellious sons to bleed.
    O noble soul, but hapless! Howso'er
    Succeeding ages shall record the deed.
'Tis country's love prevails, and glory's quenchless greed.

CX. "Lo, there the Drusi and the Decii stand,
    And stern Torquatus with his axe, and lo!
    Camilius brings in triumph to his land
    The Roman standards, rescued from the foe.
    See, too, yon pair, well-matched in equal show
    Of radiant arms, and, while obscured in night,
    Firm knit in friendly fellowship; but oh!
    How dire the feud, what hosts shall arm for fight,
What streams of carnage flow, if e'er they reach the light!

CXI. "Here from Monoecus and the Alps descends
    The father; there, with Easterns in array,
    The daughter's husband. O my sons! be friends;
    Cease from the strife; forbear the unnatural fray,
    Nor turn Rome's prowess to her own decay;
    And thou, the foremost of our blood, be first
    To fling the arms of civic strife away,
    And cease for lawless victories to thirst,
Thou of Olympian birth, and sheath the sword, accurst.

CXII. "See who from Corinth doth his march pursue,
    Decked with the spoils of many a Grecian foe.
    His car shall climb the Capitol. See, too,
    The man who lofty Argos shall o'erthrow,
    And lay the walls of Agamemnon low,
    And great AEacides himself destroy,
    Sprung from Achilles, to requite the woe
    Wrought on old Ilion, and avenge with joy
Minerva's outraged fane, and slaughtered sires of Troy.

CXIII. "Shalt thou, great Cato, unextolled remain?
    Cossus? the Gracchi? or the Scipios, ye
    Twin thunderbolts of battle, and the bane
    Of Libya? Who would fail to tell of thee,
    Fabricius, potent in thy poverty?
    Or thee, Serranus, scattering the seed?
    O spare my breath, ye Fabii; thou art he
    Called Maximus, their Greatest thou indeed,
Sole saviour, whose delay averts the hour of need.

CXIV. "Others, no doubt, from breathing bronze shall draw
    More softness, and a living face devise
    From marble, plead their causes at the law
    More deftly, trace the motions of the skies
    With learned rod, and tell the stars that rise.
    Thou, Roman, rule, and o'er the world proclaim
    The ways of peace. Be these thy victories,
    To spare the vanquished and the proud to tame.
These are imperial arts, and worthy of thy name."

CXV. He paused; and while they pondered in amaze,
    "Behold," he cried "Marcellus, see him stride,
    Proud of the spoils that tell a nation's praise.
    See how he towers, with all a conqueror's pride.
    His arm shall stem the tumult and the tide
    Of foreign hordes, and save the land from stain.
    'Tis he shall crush the rebel Gaul, and ride
    Through Punic ranks, and in Quirinus' fane
Hang up the thrice-won spoils, in triumph for the slain."

CXVI. Then thus AEneas spoke, for, passing by,
    He saw a comely youth, in bright array
    Of glittering arms; yet downcast was his eye,
    Joyless and damp his face; "O father, say,
    Who companies the hero on his way?
    His son? or scion of his stock renowned?
    What peerless excellence his looks display!
    What stir, what whispers in the crowd around!
But gloomy Night's sad shades his youthful brows surround."

CXVII. Weeping, the Sire: "Seek not, my son, to weigh
    Thy children's mighty sorrow. Him shall Fate
    Just show to earth, but suffer not to stay.
    Too potent Heaven had deemed the Roman state,
    Were gifts like this as permanent as great.
    Ah! what laments, what groanings of the brave
    Shall fill the field of Mars! What funeral state
    Shall Tiber see, as past the recent grave
Slowly and sad he winds his melancholy wave!

CXVIII. "No Trojan youth of such illustrious worth
    Shall raise the hopes of Latin sires so high.
    Ne'er shall the land of Romulus henceforth
    Look on a fosterling with prouder eye.
    O filial love! O faith of days gone by!
    O hand unconquered! None had hoped to bide
    Unscathed his onset, nor his arm defy,
    When, foot to foot, the murderous sword he plied,
Or dug with iron heel his foaming charger's side.

CXIX. "Ah! child of tears! can'st thou again be free
    And burst Fate's cruel bondage, Rome shall know
    Her own Marcellus, reappeared in thee.
    Go, fill your hands with lilies; let me strow
    The purple blossoms where he lies below.
    These gifts, at least, in sorrow will I lay,
    To grace my kinsman's spirit, thus--but oh!
    Alas, how vainly!--to the thankless clay
These unavailing dues, these empty offerings pay."

CXX. Twain are the gates of Sleep; one framed, 'tis said,
    Of horn, which easy exit doth invite
    For real shades to issue from the dead.
    One with the gleam of polished ivory bright,
    Whence only lying visions leave the night.
    Through this Anchises, talking by the way,
    Sends forth the son and Sibyl to the light.
    Back hastes AEneas to his friends, and they
Straight to Caieta steer, and anchor in her bay.




BOOK SEVEN


ARGUMENT

Passing Caieta and Circeii, AEneas sails up the Tiber (1-45). Virgil
pauses to enumerate the old rulers of Latium and to describe the state
of the country at the coming of AEneas. Latinus is King. Oracles have
foretold that by marriage with an alien his only daughter is to become
the mother of an imperial line. Fresh signs and wonders enforce the
prophecy (46-126). The Trojans eat their tables (127-171). An
embassage is sent to the Latin capital, and after conference Latinus
offers peace to the Trojans and to AEneas his daughter's hand
(172-342). Juno, the evil genius of Troy, again intervenes and
summons to her aid the demon Alecto (341-410), who excites first
Amata then Turnus against the proposed peace, and finally (411-576)
provokes a pitched battle between Trojans and Latins (577-648).
Alecto is scornfully dismissed by Juno, who causes war to be formally
declared (649-747). The war-fever in Italy. Catalogue of the leaders
and nations that gather to destroy AEneas, chief among them being
Turnus and Camilla (748-981).


I.  Thou too, Caieta, dying, to our shore,
    AEneas' nurse, hast given a deathless fame,
    E'en now thine honour guards it, as of yore,
    Still doth thy tomb in great Hesperia frame
    Glory--if that be glory--for thy name.
    Here good AEneas paid his dues aright,
    And raised a mound, and now, as evening came,
    Sails forth; the faint winds whisper to the night;
Clear shines the Moon, and tips the trembling waves with light.

II. They skirt the coast, where Circe, maiden bright,
    The Sun's rich daughter, wakes with melodies
    The groves that none may enter. There each night,
    As nimbly through the slender warp she plies
    The whistling shuttle, through her chambers rise
    The flames of odorous cedar. Thence the roar
    Of lions, raging at their chains, the cries
    Of bears close-caged, and many a bristly boar,
The yells of monstrous wolves at midnight fill the shore.

III. All these with potent herbs the cruel queen
    Had stripped of man's similitude, to wear
    A brutal figure, and a bestial mien.
    But kindly Neptune, with protecting care,
    And loth to see the pious Trojans bear
    A doom so vile, such prodigies as these,
    Lest, borne perchance into the bay, they near
    The baneful shore, fills out with favouring breeze
The sails, and speeds their flight across the boiling seas.

IV. Now blushed the deep beneath the dawning ray,
    And in her rosy chariot borne on high,
    Aurora, bright with saffron, brought the day.
    Down drop the winds, the Zephyrs cease to sigh,
    And not a breath is stirring in the sky,
    And not a ripple on the marble seas,
    As heavily the toiling oars they ply.
    When near him from the deep AEneas sees
A mighty grove outspread, a forest thick with trees.

V.  And in the midst of that delightful grove
    Fair-flowing Tiber, eddying swift and strong,
    Breaks to the main. Around them and above,
    Gay-plumaged fowl, that to the stream belong,
    And love the channel and the banks to throng,
    Now skim the flood, now fly from bough to bough,
    And charm the air with their melodious song.
    Shoreward AEneas bids them turn the prow,
And up the shady stream with joyous hearts they row.

VI. Say, Erato, how Latium fared of yore,
    What deeds were wrought, what rulers lived and died,
    When strangers landed on Ausonia's shore,
    And trace the rising of the war's dark tide.
    Fierce feuds I sing--O Goddess, be my guide,--
    Tyrrhenian hosts, the battle's armed array,
    Proud kings who fought and perished in their pride,
    And all Hesperia gathered to the fray,
A larger theme unfolds, and loftier is the lay.

VII. Long had Latinus ruled the peaceful state.
    A nymph, Marica, of Laurentian breed,
    Bore him to Faunus, who, as tales relate,
    Derived through Picus his Saturnian seed.
    No son was left Latinus to succeed,
    His boy had died ere manhood; one alone
    Remained, a daughter, so the Fates decreed,
    To mind his palace and to heir his throne
Ripe now for marriage rites, to nuptial age full-grown.

VIII. Full many a prince from Latium far and wide,
    And all Ausonia had essayed in vain
    To win the fair Lavinia for his bride.
    Her suitor now, the comeliest of the train,
    Was Turnus, sprung from an illustrious strain.
    Fair seemed his suit, for kindly was the maid,
    And dearly the queen loved him, and was fain
    His hopes to further, but the Fates gainsayed,
And boding signs from Heaven the purposed match delayed.

IX. Deep in the inmost palace, long rever'd,
    There stood an ancient laurel. 'Twas the same
    That sire Latinus, when the walls he reared,
