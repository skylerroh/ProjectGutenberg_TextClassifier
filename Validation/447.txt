goodness. If only old Norman Douglas would come back to church and pay,
it wouldn't be so bad. But he won't--and the Douglases will leave--and
you all will have to go."

Faith carried a heavy heart to bed with her that night. The thought of
leaving the Glen was unbearable. Nowhere else in the world were there
such chums as the Blythes. Her little heart had been wrung when they
had left Maywater--she had shed many bitter tears when she parted with
Maywater chums and the old manse there where her mother had lived and
died. She could not contemplate calmly the thought of such another and
harder wrench. She COULDN'T leave Glen St. Mary and dear Rainbow Valley
and that delicious graveyard.

"It's awful to be minister's family," groaned Faith into her pillow.
"Just as soon as you get fond of a place you are torn up by the roots.
I'll never, never, NEVER marry a minister, no matter how nice he is."

Faith sat up in bed and looked out of the little vine-hung window. The
night was very still, the silence broken only by Una's soft breathing.
Faith felt terribly alone in the world. She could see Glen St. Mary
lying under the starry blue meadows of the autumn night. Over the
valley a light shone from the girls' room at Ingleside, and another from
Walter's room. Faith wondered if poor Walter had toothache again. Then
she sighed, with a little passing sigh of envy of Nan and Di. They had a
mother and a settled home--THEY were not at the mercy of people who got
angry without any reason and called you a varmint. Away beyond the Glen,
amid fields that were very quiet with sleep, another light was burning.
Faith knew it shone in the house where Norman Douglas lived. He was
reputed to sit up all hours of the night reading. Mary had said if he
could only be induced to return to the church all would be well. And
why not? Faith looked at a big, low star hanging over the tall, pointed
spruce at the gate of the Methodist Church and had an inspiration. She
knew what ought to be done and she, Faith Meredith, would do it. She
would make everything right. With a sigh of satisfaction, she turned
from the lonely, dark world and cuddled down beside Una.



CHAPTER XVI. TIT FOR TAT

With Faith, to decide was to act. She lost no time in carrying out the
idea. As soon as she came home from school the next day she left the
manse and made her way down the Glen. Walter Blythe joined her as she
passed the post office.

"I'm going to Mrs. Elliott's on an errand for mother," he said. "Where
are you going, Faith?"

"I am going somewhere on church business," said Faith loftily. She did
not volunteer any further information and Walter felt rather snubbed.
They walked on in silence for a little while. It was a warm, windy
evening with a sweet, resinous air. Beyond the sand dunes were gray
seas, soft and beautiful. The Glen brook bore down a freight of gold
and crimson leaves, like fairy shallops. In Mr. James Reese's buckwheat
stubble-land, with its beautiful tones of red and brown, a crow
parliament was being held, whereat solemn deliberations regarding the
welfare of crowland were in progress. Faith cruelly broke up the august
assembly by climbing up on the fence and hurling a broken rail at it.
Instantly the air was filled with flapping black wings and indignant
caws.

"Why did you do that?" said Walter reproachfully. "They were having such
a good time."

"Oh, I hate crows," said Faith airily. "The are so black and sly I feel
sure they're hypocrites. They steal little birds' eggs out of their
nests, you know. I saw one do it on our lawn last spring. Walter, what
makes you so pale to-day? Did you have the toothache again last night?"

Walter shivered.

"Yes--a raging one. I couldn't sleep a wink--so I just paced up and down
the floor and imagined I was an early Christian martyr being tortured
at the command of Nero. That helped ever so much for a while--and then I
got so bad I couldn't imagine anything."

"Did you cry?" asked Faith anxiously.

"No--but I lay down on the floor and groaned," admitted Walter. "Then
the girls came in and Nan put cayenne pepper in it--and that made
it worse--Di made me hold a swallow of cold water in my mouth--and I
couldn't stand it, so they called Susan. Susan said it served me right
for sitting up in the cold garret yesterday writing poetry trash. But
she started up the kitchen fire and got me a hot-water bottle and it
stopped the toothache. As soon as I felt better I told Susan my poetry
wasn't trash and she wasn't any judge. And she said no, thank goodness
she was not and she did not know anything about poetry except that it
was mostly a lot of lies. Now you know, Faith, that isn't so. That is
one reason why I like writing poetry--you can say so many things in it
that are true in poetry but wouldn't be true in prose. I told Susan
so, but she said to stop my jawing and go to sleep before the water got
cold, or she'd leave me to see if rhyming would cure toothache, and she
hoped it would be a lesson to me."

"Why don't you go to the dentist at Lowbridge and get the tooth out?"

Walter shivered again.

"They want me to--but I can't. It would hurt so."

"Are you afraid of a little pain?" asked Faith contemptuously.

Walter flushed.

"It would be a BIG pain. I hate being hurt. Father said he wouldn't
insist on my going--he'd wait until I'd made up my own mind to go."

"It wouldn't hurt as long as the toothache," argued Faith, "You've had
five spells of toothache. If you'd just go and have it out there'd be no
more bad nights. _I_ had a tooth out once. I yelled for a moment, but it
was all over then--only the bleeding."

"The bleeding is worst of all--it's so ugly," cried Walter. "It just
made me sick when Jem cut his foot last summer. Susan said I looked more
like fainting than Jem did. But I couldn't hear to see Jem hurt, either.
Somebody is always getting hurt, Faith--and it's awful. I just can't
BEAR to see things hurt. It makes me just want to run--and run--and
run--till I can't hear or see them."

"There's no use making a fuss over anyone getting hurt," said Faith,
tossing her curls. "Of course, if you've hurt yourself very bad, you
have to yell--and blood IS messy--and I don't like seeing other people
hurt, either. But I don't want to run--I want to go to work and help
them. Your father HAS to hurt people lots of times to cure them. What
would they do if HE ran away?"

"I didn't say I WOULD run. I said I WANTED to run. That's a different
thing. I want to help people, too. But oh, I wish there weren't any
ugly, dreadful things in the world. I wish everything was glad and
beautiful."

"Well, don't let's think of what isn't," said Faith. "After all, there's
lots of fun in being alive. You wouldn't have toothache if you were
dead, but still, wouldn't you lots rather be alive than dead? I would,
a hundred times. Oh, here's Dan Reese. He's been down to the harbour for
fish."

"I hate Dan Reese," said Walter.

"So do I. All us girls do. I'm just going to walk past and never take
the least notice of him. You watch me!"

Faith accordingly stalked past Dan with her chin out and an expression
of scorn that bit into his soul. He turned and shouted after her.

"Pig-girl! Pig-girl!! Pig-girl!!!" in a crescendo of insult.

Faith walked on, seemingly oblivious. But her lip trembled slightly with
a sense of outrage. She knew she was no match for Dan Reese when it
came to an exchange of epithets. She wished Jem Blythe had been with
her instead of Walter. If Dan Reese had dared to call her a pig-girl in
Jem's hearing, Jem would have wiped up the dust with him. But it never
occurred to Faith to expect Walter to do it, or blame him for not doing
it. Walter, she knew, never fought other boys. Neither did Charlie Clow
of the north road. The strange part was that, while she despised Charlie
for a coward, it never occurred to her to disdain Walter. It was
simply that he seemed to her an inhabitant of a world of his own, where
different traditions prevailed. Faith would as soon have expected a
starry-eyed young angel to pummel dirty, freckled Dan Reese for her as
Walter Blythe. She would not have blamed the angel and she did not blame
Walter Blythe. But she wished that sturdy Jem or Jerry had been there
and Dan's insult continued to rankle in her soul.

Walter was pale no longer. He had flushed crimson and his beautiful eyes
were clouded with shame and anger. He knew that he ought to have avenged
Faith. Jem would have sailed right in and made Dan eat his words with
bitter sauce. Ritchie Warren would have overwhelmed Dan with worse
"names" than Dan had called Faith. But Walter could not--simply could
not--"call names." He knew he would get the worst of it. He could never
conceive or utter the vulgar, ribald insults of which Dan Reese had
unlimited command. And as for the trial by fist, Walter couldn't fight.
He hated the idea. It was rough and painful--and, worst of all, it
was ugly. He never could understand Jem's exultation in an occasional
conflict. But he wished he COULD fight Dan Reese. He was horribly
ashamed because Faith Meredith had been insulted in his presence and he
had not tried to punish her insulter. He felt sure she must despise him.
She had not even spoken to him since Dan had called her pig-girl. He was
glad when they came to the parting of the ways.

Faith, too, was relieved, though for a different reason. She wanted
to be alone because she suddenly felt rather nervous about her errand.
Impulse had cooled, especially since Dan had bruised her self-respect.
She must go through with it, but she no longer had enthusiasm to sustain
her. She was going to see Norman Douglas and ask him to come back to
church, and she began to be afraid of him. What had seemed so easy and
simple up at the Glen seemed very different down here. She had heard a
good deal about Norman Douglas, and she knew that even the biggest boys
in school were afraid of him. Suppose he called her something nasty--she
had heard he was given to that. Faith could not endure being called
names--they subdued her far more quickly than a physical blow. But she
would go on--Faith Meredith always went on. If she did not her father
might have to leave the Glen.

At the end of the long lane Faith came to the house--a big,
old-fashioned one with a row of soldierly Lombardies marching past
it. On the back veranda Norman Douglas himself was sitting, reading a
newspaper. His big dog was beside him. Behind, in the kitchen, where
his housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson, was getting supper, there was a clatter of
dishes--an angry clatter, for Norman Douglas had just had a quarrel with
Mrs. Wilson, and both were in a very bad temper over it. Consequently,
when Faith stepped on the veranda and Norman Douglas lowered his
newspaper she found herself looking into the choleric eyes of an
irritated man.

Norman Douglas was rather a fine-looking personage in his way. He had
a sweep of long red beard over his broad chest and a mane of red hair,
ungrizzled by the years, on his massive head. His high, white forehead
was unwrinkled and his blue eyes could flash still with all the fire of
his tempestuous youth. He could be very amiable when he liked, and he
could be very terrible. Poor Faith, so anxiously bent on retrieving the
situation in regard to the church, had caught him in one of his terrible
moods.

He did not know who she was and he gazed at her with disfavour. Norman
Douglas liked girls of spirit and flame and laughter. At this moment
Faith was very pale. She was of the type to which colour means
everything. Lacking her crimson cheeks she seemed meek and even
insignificant. She looked apologetic and afraid, and the bully in Norman
Douglas's heart stirred.

"Who the dickens are you? And what do you want here?" he demanded in his
great resounding voice, with a fierce scowl.

For once in her life Faith had nothing to say. She had never supposed
Norman Douglas was like THIS. She was paralyzed with terror of him. He
saw it and it made him worse.

"What's the matter with you?" he boomed. "You look as if you wanted to
say something and was scared to say it. What's troubling you? Confound
it, speak up, can't you?"

No. Faith could not speak up. No words would come. But her lips began to
tremble.

"For heaven's sake, don't cry," shouted Norman. "I can't stand
snivelling. If you've anything to say, say it and have done. Great
Kitty, is the girl possessed of a dumb spirit? Don't look at me like
that--I'm human--I haven't got a tail! Who are you--who are you, I say?"

Norman's voice could have been heard at the harbour. Operations in the
kitchen were suspended. Mrs. Wilson was listening open-eared and eyed.
Norman put his huge brown hands on his knees and leaned forward, staring
into Faith's pallid, shrinking face. He seemed to loom over her like
some evil giant out of a fairy tale. She felt as if he would eat her up
next thing, body and bones.

"I--am--Faith--Meredith," she said, in little more than a whisper.

"Meredith, hey? One of the parson's youngsters, hey? I've heard of
you--I've heard of you! Riding on pigs and breaking the Sabbath! A nice
lot! What do you want here, hey? What do you want of the old pagan,
hey? _I_ don't ask favours of parsons--and I don't give any. What do you
want, I say?"

Faith wished herself a thousand miles away. She stammered out her
thought in its naked simplicity.

"I came--to ask you--to go to church--and pay--to the salary."

Norman glared at her. Then he burst forth again.

"You impudent hussy--you! Who put you up to it, jade? Who put you up to
it?"

"Nobody," said poor Faith.

"That's a lie. Don't lie to me! Who sent you here? It wasn't your
father--he hasn't the smeddum of a flea--but he wouldn't send you to do
what he dassn't do himself. I suppose it was some of them confounded old
maids at the Glen, was it--was it, hey?"

"No--I--I just came myself."

"Do you take me for a fool?" shouted Norman.

"No--I thought you were a gentleman," said Faith faintly, and certainly
without any thought of being sarcastic.

Norman bounced up.

"Mind your own business. I don't want to hear another word from you. If
you wasn't such a kid I'd teach you to interfere in what doesn't concern
you. When I want parsons or pill-dosers I'll send for them. Till I
do I'll have no truck with them. Do you understand? Now, get out,
cheese-face."

Faith got out. She stumbled blindly down the steps, out of the yard gate
and into the lane. Half way up the lane her daze of fear passed away and
a reaction of tingling anger possessed her. By the time she reached
the end of the lane she was in such a furious temper as she had never
experienced before. Norman Douglas' insults burned in her soul, kindling
a scorching flame. Go home! Not she! She would go straight back and
tell that old ogre just what she thought of him--she would show him--oh,
wouldn't she! Cheese-face, indeed!

Unhesitatingly she turned and walked back. The veranda was deserted and
the kitchen door shut. Faith opened the door without knocking, and went
in. Norman Douglas had just sat down at the supper table, but he still
held his newspaper. Faith walked inflexibly across the room, caught the
paper from his hand, flung it on the floor and stamped on it. Then she
faced him, with her flashing eyes and scarlet cheeks. She was such a
handsome young fury that Norman Douglas hardly recognized her.

"What's brought you back?" he growled, but more in bewilderment than
rage.

Unquailingly she glared back into the angry eyes against which so few
people could hold their own.
