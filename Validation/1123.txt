    _Frederik Pohl wrote recently about the time, when he was young,
    when he spent more time in Barsoom than in Brooklyn. Allan Howard,
    Director of the Eastern Science Fiction Association in Newark, takes
    us back to those nostalgic days in this vignette of man's first
    hours on Mars._
