INTRODUCTION

This volume is the introductory part of a course in American history
embodying the plan of study recommended by the Committee of Eight of the
American Historical Association.[1] The plan calls for a continuous
course running through grades six, seven, and eight. The events which
have taken place within the limits of what is now the United States must
necessarily furnish the most of the content of the lessons. But the
Committee urge that enough other matter, of an introductory character,
be included to teach boys and girls of from twelve to fourteen years of
age that our civilization had its beginnings far back in the history of
the Old World. Such introductory study will enable them to think of our
country in its true historical setting. The Committee recommend that
about two-thirds of one year's work be devoted to this preliminary
matter, and that the remainder of the year be given to the period of
discovery and exploration.

The plan of the Committee of Eight emphasizes three or four lines of
development in the world's history leading up to American
history proper.

First, there was a movement of conquest or colonization by which the
ancient civilized world, originally made up of communities like the
Greeks and Phoenicians in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean Seas,
spread to southern Italy and adjacent lands. The Roman conquest of Italy
and of the barbarian tribes of western Europe expanded the civilized
world to the shores of the Atlantic. Within this greater Roman world new
nations grew up. The migration of Europeans to the American continent
was the final step.

Second, accompanying the growth of the civilized world in extent was a
growth of knowledge of the shape of the earth, or of what we call
geography. Columbus was a geographer as well as the herald of an
expanding world.

A third process was the creation and transmission of all that we mean by
civilization. Here, as the Committee remark, the effort should be to
"show, in a very simple way, the civilization which formed the heritage
of those who were to go to America, that is, to explain what America
started with."

The Committee also suggest that it is necessary "to associate the three
or four peoples of Europe which were to have a share in American
colonization with enough of their characteristic incidents to give the
child some feeling for the name 'England,' 'Spain,' 'Holland,' and
'France.'"

No attempt is made in this book to give a connected history of Greece,
Rome, England, or any other country of Europe. Such an attempt would be
utterly destructive of the plan. Only those features of early
civilization and those incidents of history have been selected which
appear to have a vital relation to the subsequent fortunes of mankind in
America as well as in Europe. They are treated in all cases as
introductory. Opinions may differ upon the question of what topics best
illustrate the relation. The Committee leaves a wide margin of
opportunity for the exercise of judgment in selection. In the use of a
textbook based on the plan the teacher should use the same liberty of
selection. For example, we have chosen the story of Marathon to
illustrate the idea of the heroic memories of Greece. Others may prefer
Thermopylae, because this story seems to possess a simpler dramatic
development. In the same way teachers may desire to give more emphasis
to certain phases of ancient or mediaeval civilization or certain heroic
persons treated very briefly in this book. Exercises similar to those
inserted at the end of each chapter offer means of supplementing work
provided in the text.

The story of American discovery and exploration in the plan of the
Committee of Eight follows the introductory matter as a natural
culmination. In our textbook we have adhered to the same plan of
division. The work of the seventh grade will, therefore, open with the
study of the first permanent English settlements.

The discoveries and explorations are told in more detail than most of
the earlier incidents, but whatever is referred to is treated, we hope,
with such simplicity and definiteness of statement that it will be
comprehensible and instructive to pupils of the sixth grade.

At the close of the book will be found a list of references. From this
teachers may draw a rich variety of stories and descriptions to
illustrate any features of the subject which especially interest their
classes. In the index is given the pronunciation of difficult names.

We wish to express gratitude to those who have aided us with wise advice
and criticism.

INTRODUCTORY AMERICAN HISTORY



CHAPTER I

THE SCATTERED CHILDREN OF EUROPE


THE EMIGRANT AND WHAT HE BRINGS TO AMERICA. The emigrant who lands
  at New York, Boston, Philadelphia, or any other seaport, brings with
  him something which we do not see. He may have in his hands only a
  small bundle of clothing and enough money to pay his railroad fare to
  his new home, but he is carrying another kind of baggage more valuable
  than bundles or boxes or a pocket full of silver or gold. This other
  baggage is the knowledge, the customs, and the memories he has brought
  from the fatherland.

  He has already learned in Europe how to do the work at which he hopes
  to labor in America. In his native land he has been taught to obey the
  laws and to do his duty as a citizen. This fits him to share in our
  self-government. He also brings great memories, for he likes to think
  of the brave and noble deeds done by men of his race. If he is a
  religious man, he worships God just as his forefathers have for
  hundreds of years. To understand how the emigrant happens to know what
  he does and to be what he is, we must study the history of the country
  from which he comes.

ALL AMERICANS ARE EMIGRANTS. If this is true of the newcomer, it is
  equally true of the rest of us, for we are all emigrants. The Indians
  are the only native Americans, and when we find out more about them we
  may learn that they, too, are emigrants. If we follow the history of
  our families far enough back, we shall come upon the names of our
  forefathers who sailed from Europe. They may have come to America in
  the early days when there were only a few settlements scattered along
  our Atlantic coast, or they may have come since the Revolutionary War
  changed the English colonies into the United States.

  Like the Canadians, the South Americans, and the Australians, we are
  simply Europeans who have moved away. The story of the Europe in which
  our forefathers lived is, therefore, part of our story. In order to
  understand our own history we must know something of the history of
  England, France, Germany, Italy, and other European lands.

WHAT THE EARLY EMIGRANTS BROUGHT. If we read the story of our
  forefathers before they left Europe, we shall find answers to several
  important questions. Why, we ask, did Columbus seek for new lands or
  for new ways to lands already known? How did the people of Europe live
  at the time he discovered America? What did they know how to do? Were
  they skilful in all sorts of work, or were they as rude and ignorant
  as the Indians on the western shores of the Atlantic?

  The answers which history will give to these questions will say that
  the first emigrants who landed on our shores brought with them much of
  the same knowledge and many of the same customs and memories which
  emigrants bring nowadays and which we also have. It is true that since
  the time the first settlers came men have found out how to make many
  new things. The most important of these are the steam-engine, the
  electric motor, the telegraph, and the telephone. But it is surprising
  how many important things, which we still use, were made before
  Columbus saw America.

  [Illustration: A MODERN STEAMSHIP AND AN EARLY SAILING VESSEL
  The early emigrants came in small sailing vessels and suffered great
  hardships]

  For one thing, men knew how to print books. This art had been
  discovered during the boyhood of Columbus. Another thing, men could
  make guns, while the Indians had only bows and arrows. The ships in
  which Columbus sailed across the ocean seemed very large and wonderful
  to the Indians, who used canoes. The ships were steered with the help
  of a compass, an instrument which the Indians had never seen.

  Some of the things which the early emigrants knew had been known
  hundreds or thousands of years before. One of the oldest was the art
  of writing. The way to write words or sounds was found out so long ago
  that we shall never know the name of the man who first discovered it.
  The historians tell us he lived in Egypt, which was in northern
  Africa, exactly where Egypt is now. Some men were afraid that the new
  art might do more harm than good. The king to whom the secret was told
  thought that the children would be unwilling to work hard and try to
  remember because everything could be written down and they would not
  need to use their memories. The Egyptians at first used pictures to
  put their words upon rocks or paper, and even after they made several
  letters of the alphabet their writing seemed like a mixture of little
  pictures and queer marks.

OLD AND NEW INVENTIONS. Those who first discover how to make things
  are called inventors, and what they make are called inventions. Now if
  we should write out a list of the most useful inventions, we could
  place in one column the inventions which were made before the days of
  Columbus and in another those which have been made since. With this
  list before us we may ask which inventions we could live without and
  which we could not spare unless we were willing to become like the
  savages. We should find that a large number of the inventions which we
  use every day belong to the set of things older than Columbus. This is
  another reason why, if we wish to understand our ways of living and
  working, we must ask about the history of the countries where our
  forefathers lived. It is the beginning of our own history.

  GROWTH OF LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET]

A PLAN OF STUDY. The discovery of America was made in 1492, at the
  beginning of what we call Modern Times. Before Modern Times were the
  Middle Ages, lasting about a thousand years. These began three or four
  hundred years after the time of Christ or what we call the beginning
  of the Christian Era. All the events that took place earlier we say
  happened in Ancient Times. Much that we know was learned first by the
  Greeks or Romans who lived in Ancient Times.

  It is in the Middle Ages that we first hear of peoples called
  Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Dutchmen, Italians, Spaniards, and
  many others now living in Great Britain and on the Continent of
  Europe. We shall learn first of the Greeks and Romans and of what they
  knew and succeeded in doing, and then shall find out how these things
  were learned by the peoples of the Middle Ages and what they added to
  them. This will help us to find out what our forefathers started with
  when they came to live in America.

    1. What does the emigrant from Europe bring to America besides his
    baggage?

    2. Why are all Americans emigrants?

    3. What did the earliest emigrants from Europe to America bring with
    them?

    4. Which do you think the more useful invention--the telephone or
    the art of writing? Who invented this art? Find Egypt on the map.
    How did Egyptian writing look?

    5. Why was it a help to Columbus that gunpowder and guns were
    invented before he discovered America?

    6. When did the Christian Era begin? What is meant by Ancient Times?
    By the Middle Ages? By Modern Times? In what Times was the art of
    writing invented? In what Times was the compass invented? In what

    EXERCISES

    1. Collect from illustrated papers, magazines, or advertising
    folders, pictures of ocean steamships. Collect pictures of sailing
    ships, ships used now and those used long ago.

    2. Collect from persons who have recently come to this country
    stories of how they traveled from Europe to America, and from ports
    like Boston, New York, and Philadelphia to where they now live.

    3. Let each boy and girl in the schoolroom point out on the map the
    European country from which his parents or his grandparents or his
    forefathers came.

    4. Let each boy and girl make a list of the holidays which his
    forefathers had in the "fatherland" or "mother country." Let each
    find out the manner in which the holidays were kept. Let each tell
    the most interesting hero story from among the stories of the mother
    country or fatherland. Let each find out whether the tools used in
    the old home were like the tools his parents use here.
