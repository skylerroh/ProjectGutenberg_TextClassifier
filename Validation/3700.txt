DANGER IN DEEP SPACE




CHAPTER 1


"Stand by to reduce thrust on main drive rockets!" The tall,
broad-shouldered officer in the uniform of the Solar Guard snapped out
the order as he watched the telescanner screen and saw the Western
Hemisphere of Earth looming larger and larger.

"Aye, aye, Captain Strong," replied a handsome curly-haired Space Cadet.
He turned to the ship's intercom and spoke quickly into the microphone.

"Control deck to power deck. Check in!"

"Power deck, aye," a bull-throated voice bellowed over the loud-speaker.

"Stand by rockets, Astro! We're coming in for a landing."

"Standing by!"

The Solar Guard officer turned away from the telescanner and glanced
quickly over the illuminated banks of indicators on the control panel.
"Is our orbit to Space Academy clear?" he asked the cadet. "Have we been
assigned a landing ramp?"

"I'll check topside, sir," answered the cadet, turning back to the
intercom. "Control deck to radar deck. Check in!"

"Radar bridge, aye," drawled a lazy voice over the speaker.

"Are we cleared for landing, Roger?"

"Everything clear as glass ahead, Tom," was the calm reply.

"We're steady on orbit and we touch down on ramp seven. Then"--the voice
began to quicken with excitement--"three weeks' liberty coming up!"

The rumbling voice of the power-deck cadet suddenly broke in over the
intercom. "Lay off that space gas, Manning. Just see that this space
wagon gets on the ground in one piece. Then you can dream about your
leave!"

"Plug your jets, you big Venusian ape man," was the reply, "or I'll turn
you inside out!"

"Yeah? You and what fleet of spaceships?"

"Just me, buster, with my bare hands!"

The Solar Guard officer on the control deck smiled at the young cadet
beside him as the good-natured argument crackled over the intercom
speaker overhead. "Looks like those two will never stop battling,
Corbett," he commented dryly.

"Guess they'll never learn, sir," sighed the cadet.

"That's all right. It's when they stop battling that I'll start getting
worried," answered the officer. He turned back to the controls. "One
hundred thousand feet from Earth's surface! Begin landing procedure!"

As Cadet Tom Corbett snapped orders into the intercom and his unit-mates
responded by smooth co-ordinated action, the giant rocket cruiser
_Polaris_ slowly arched through Earth's atmosphere, first nosing up to
lose speed and then settling tailfirst toward its destination--the
spaceport at Space Academy, U.S.A.

Far below, on the grounds of the Academy, cadets wearing the green
uniforms of first-year Earthworms and the blue of the upper-classmen
stopped all activity as they heard the blasting of the braking rockets
high in the heavens. They stared enviously into the sky, watching the
smooth steel-hulled spaceship drop toward the concrete ramp area of the
spaceport, three miles away.

In his office at the top of the gleaming Tower of Galileo, Commander
Walters, commandant of Space Academy, paused for a moment from his
duties and turned from his desk to watch the touchdown of the great
spaceship. And on the grassy quadrangle, Warrant Officer Mike McKenny,
short and stubby in his scarlet uniform of the enlisted Solar Guard,
stopped his frustrating task of drilling newly arrived cadets to watch
the mighty ship come to Earth.

Young and old, the feeling of belonging to the great fleet that
patrolled the space lanes across the millions of miles of the solar
system was something that never died in a true spaceman. The green-clad
cadets dreamed of the future when they would feel the bucking rockets in
their backs. And the older men smiled faintly as memories of their own
first space flight came to mind.

Aboard the _Polaris_, the young cadet crew worked swiftly and smoothly
to bring their ship to a safe landing. There was Tom Corbett, an average
young man in this age of science, who had been selected as the
control-deck and command cadet of the _Polaris_ unit after rigid
examinations and tests. Topside, on the radar bridge, was Roger Manning,
cocky and brash, but a specialist in radar and communications. Below, on
the power deck, was Astro, a colonial from Venus, who had been accused
of cutting his teeth on an atomic rocket motor, so great was his skill
with the mighty "thrust buckets," as he lovingly called the atomic
rockets.

Now, returning from a routine training flight that had taken them to the
moons of Jupiter, the three cadets, Corbett, Manning, and Astro, and
their unit skipper, Captain Steve Strong, completed the delicate task of
setting the great ship down on the Academy spaceport.

"Closing in fast, sir," announced Tom, his attention focused on the
meters and dials in front of him. "Five hundred feet to touchdown."

"Full braking thrust!" snapped Strong crisply.

Deep inside the _Polaris_, braking rockets roared with unceasing power,
and the mighty spaceship eased itself to the concrete surface of the
Academy spaceport.

"Touchdown!" yelled Tom. He quickly closed the master control lever,
cutting all power, and sudden silence filled the ship. He stood up and
faced Strong, saluting smartly.

"Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ completes mission"--he glanced at the astral
chronometer on the panel board--"at fifteen thirty-three, sir."

"Very well, Corbett," replied Strong, returning the salute. "Check the
_Polaris_ from radar mast to exhaust ports right away."

"Yes, sir," was Tom's automatic answer, and then he caught himself. "But
I thought--"

Strong interrupted him with a wave of his hand. "I know, Corbett, you
thought the _Polaris_ would be pulled in for a general overhaul and you
three would get liberty."

"Yes, sir," replied Tom.

"I'm not sure you won't get it," said Strong, "but I received a message
last night from Commander Walters. I think the _Polaris_ unit might have
another assignment coming up!"

"By the rings of Saturn," drawled Roger from the open hatch to the radar
bridge, "you might know the old man would have another mission for us!
We haven't had a liberty since we were Earthworms!"

"I'm sorry, Manning," said Strong, "but you know if I had my way, you'd
certainly get the liberty. If anyone deserves it, you three do."

By this time Astro had joined the group on the control deck.

"But, sir," ventured Tom, "we've all made plans, I mean--well, my folks
are expecting me."

"_Us_, you mean," interrupted Roger. "Astro and I are your guests,
remember?"

"Sure, I remember," said Tom, smiling. He turned back to Captain Strong.
"We'd appreciate it if you could do something for us, sir. I
mean--well, have another unit assigned."

Strong stepped forward and put his arms around the shoulders of Tom and
Roger and faced Astro. "I'm afraid you three made a big mistake in
becoming the best unit in the Academy. Now every time there's an
important assignment to be handed out the name of the _Polaris_ unit
sticks out like a hot rocket!"

"Some consolation," said Roger dourly.

Strong smiled. "All right, check this wagon and then report to me in my
quarters in the morning. You'll have tonight off at least. Unit
_dis_-missed!"

The three cadets snapped their backs straight, stood rigid, and saluted
as their superior officer strode toward the hatch. His foot on the
ladder, he turned and faced them again.

"It's been a fine mission. I want to compliment you on the way you've
handled yourselves these past few months. You boys are real spacemen!"
He saluted and disappeared down the ladder leading to the exit port.

"And that," said Roger, turning to his unit-mates, "is known as the
royal come-on for a dirty detail!"

"Ahhh, stop your gassing, Manning," growled Astro. "Just be sure your
radar bridge is O.K. If we do have to blast out of here in a hurry, I
want to get where we're supposed to be going!"

"You just worry about the power deck, spaceboy, and let little Roger
take care of his own department," replied Roger.

Astro eyed him speculatively. "You know the only reason they allowed
this space creep in the Academy, Tom?" asked Astro.

"No, why?" asked Tom, playing along with the game.

"Because they knew any time the _Polaris_ ran out of reactant fuel we
could just stick Manning in the rocket tubes and have him blow out some
of his special brand of space gas!"

"Listen, you Venusian throwback! One more word out of you and--"

"All right, you two!" broke in Tom good-naturedly. "Enough's enough!
Come on. We've got just enough time to run up to the mess hall and grab
a good meal before we check the ship."

"That's for me," said Astro. "I've been eating those concentrates so
long my stomach thinks I've turned into a test tube."

Astro referred to the food taken along on space missions. It was
dehydrated and packed in plastic containers to save weight and space.
The concentrates never made a satisfactory meal, even though they
supplied everything necessary for a healthful diet.

A few moments later the three members of the _Polaris_ stood on the main
slidewalk, an endless belt of plastic, powered by giant subsurface
rollers, being carried from the spaceport to the main academy
administration building, the great gleaming Tower of Galileo.

Space Academy, the university of the planets, was set among the low
hills of the western part of the North American continent. Here, in the
nest of fledgling spacemen, boys from Earth and the colonies of Venus
and Mars learned the complex science that would enable them to reach
unlimited heights; to rocket through the endless void of space and visit
new worlds on distant planets millions of miles from Earth.

This was the year 2353--the age of space! A time when boys dreamed only
of becoming Space Cadets at Space Academy, to learn their trade and
later enter the mighty Solar Guard, or join the rapidly expanding
merchant space service that sent out great fleets of rocket ships daily
to every corner of the solar system.

As the slidewalk carried the three cadets between the buildings that
surrounded the grassy quadrangle of the Academy, Tom looked up at the
Tower of Galileo dominating the entire area.

"You know," he began haltingly, "every time I go near this place I get a
lump in my throat!"

"Yeah," breathed Astro, "me too."

Roger made no comment. His eyes were following the path of the giant
