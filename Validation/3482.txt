but as it is extremely likely I shall be back in punishment by the
evening, I thought we would have a little chat while I was able to have
it. Just make way for me in your bed; I'll nestle up close to you, and
we'll be ever so jolly."

"Oh, do," said Nora, in a hearty tone.

Molly scrambled in, taking the lion's share of the bed, Nora lay on the
edge.

"I am glad you are facing the light, for I can examine your features
well," said Molly. "You certainly are very nice-looking. How prettily
your eyebrows are arched, and what white teeth you have! And, although
you have that wonderful black hair, you have a fair skin, and your
cheeks have just enough color; not too much. I hate florid people; but
you are just perfect."

"I wish you would not flatter me, Molly," said Nora; "nobody flatters me
in Ireland."

"They don't? But I thought they were a perfect nation of flatterers. I
am sure it is always said of them."

"Oh, if you mean the poor people," said Nora; "they make pretty
speeches, but nobody thinks anything about that. Everybody makes pretty
speeches to everybody else, except when we are having a violent scold by
way of a change."

"How delicious!" said Molly. "And what sort of house have you? Like
this?"

"No, not the least like this," answered Nora.

"With what emphasis you speak. Do you know that father told me you
lived in a beautiful place, a castle hanging over the sea, and that your
mountains and your sea and your old castle were things to be proud of?"

"Did he? Did your father really say that?" asked Nora. She sat up on
her elbow; her eyes were shining; they assumed a look which Nora's eyes
often wore when she was, as she expressed it, "seeing things out of
her head." Far-off castles in the clouds would Nora look at then;
rainbow-tinted were they, and their summits reached heaven. Molly gazed
at her with deepening interest.

"Yes, Nora," she said; "he did say it. He told me so before Terence
came; but I--do forgive me--I don't care for Terence."

"You must not talk against him to me," said Nora, "because he happens to
be my brother; but I'll just whisper one thing back to you, Molly--if he
was not my brother he would not suit me."

"How nice of you to say that! We shall get on splendidly. Of course, you
must stick up for him, being your brother; he stuck up for you before
you came. It is very nice and loyal of you, and I quite understand. But,
dear me! I am not likely to see much of you while you are here."

"Why not? Are you not going to stay here?"

"Oh, my dear, yes; I'll stay. School has just begun over again, you
know, and I am always in hot water. I cannot help it; it is a sort of
way of mine. This is the kind of way I live. Breakfast every morning;
then a lecture from mother or from father. Off I go in low spirits,
with a great, sore heart inside me; then comes the hateful discipline
of school; and every day I get into disgrace. I have a lot of lessons
returned, and am low down in my class, instead of high up, and am
treated from first to last as a naughty child. By the middle of the day
I am a very naughty child indeed."

"But you are not a child at all, Molly; you are a woman. Why, you are
older than I."

"Oh, what have years to do with it?" interrupted Molly. "I shall be
a child all my days, I tell you. I shall never be really old. I like
mischief and insubordination, and--and--let me whisper it to you, little
Nora--vulgarity. Yes, I do love to be vulgar. I like shocking mother;
I like shocking father. Since Terence came I have had rare fun shocking
him. I have learned a lot of slang, and whenever I see Terence I shout
it at him. He has got quite nervous lately, and avoids me. He likes
Linda awfully, but he avoids me. But, to go on with my day. I am back
from school to early dinner, generally in disgrace. I am not allowed to
speak at dinner. Back again I go to school, and I am home, or supposed
to be home, at half-past four; but not a bit of it, my dear; I don't
get home till about six, because I am kept in to learn my lessons. It is
disgraceful, of course; but it is a fact. Then back I come, and mother
has a talk with me. However busy mother may be, and she is a very busy
woman, Nora--you will soon find that out--she always has time to find
out if I have done anything naughty; and, as fibs are not any of my
accomplishments, I always tell her the truth; and then what do you think
happens? An evening quite to myself in my bedroom; my dinner sent up to
me there, and I eating it in solitary state. They are all accustomed to
it. They open their eyes and almost glare at me when by a mere chance I
do come down to dinner. They are quite uncomfortable, because, you see,
I am waiting my opportunity to fire slang at one of them. I always do,
and always will. I never could fit into the dull life of the English."

"You must be Irish, really," said Nora.

"You don't say so! But I am afraid I am not. I would give all the world
to be, but am quite certain I am not. There, now, of course I'd be
awfully scolded if it was found out that I had awakened you at this
hour, and had confided my little history to you. I am over sixteen.
I shall be seventeen in ten months' time. And that is my history,
insubordination from first to last. I don't suppose anybody really likes
me, unless it is poor Annie Jefferson at school."

"Who is Annie Jefferson, Molly?"

"A very shabby sort of girl, who is always in hot water too. I have
taken to her, and she just adores me. There is no one else who loves me;
and she, poor child, would not be admitted inside these walls; she is
not aristocratic enough. Dear me, Nora! it is wrong of me to give you
all this information so soon; and don't look anxious about me, little
goose, for I have taken an enormous fancy to you."

"I will tell you one thing," said Nora after a pause, "if you will never
tell again."

"Oh, a secret!" said Molly. "Tell it out, Nora. I love secrets. I'll
never betray; I have no friends to betray them to. You may tell me with
all the heart in the world."

"Well, it is this," said Nora; "we are not at all rich at home. We are
poor, and have no luxuries and the dear old house is very bare; and, oh!
but, Molly, there is no place like it--no place like it. It's worth all
the world to me; and when I came here last night, and saw your great,
rich, beautiful house, I--I quite hated it, and I almost hated Linda
too; and even my uncle, who has been so kind, I could not get up
one charitable thought for him, nor for your mother, who is such a
beautiful, gracious lady; and even Terence--oh! Terry seemed quite
English. Oh, I was miserable! But when I saw you, Molly, I said to
myself, 'There is one person who will fit me'; and--oh, don't Molly!
What is it?"

"Only, if you say another word I shall squeeze you to death in the hug
I am giving you," said Molly. Her arms were flung tightly round Nora's
neck. She kissed her passionately three or four times.

"We'll be friends. I'll stick up for you through thick and thin," said
Molly. "And now I'm off; for if Linda caught me woe betide me."

"One word before you go, Molly," called out Nora.

"Yes," said Molly, standing at the door.

"Try to keep straight to-day, for my sake, for I shall want to say a
great deal to you to-night."

"Oh, yes, so I will," answered Molly. "Now then, off I go."

The door was banged behind her. It awoke Mrs. Hartrick, who turned
slowly on her pillow, and said to herself, "I am quite certain that
wicked girl Molly has been disturbing our poor little traveler." But
she fell asleep, and Nora lay thinking of Molly. How queer she was! And
yet--and yet she was the only person in the English home who had yet
managed to touch Nora's warm Irish heart.

The rest of the day passed somewhat soberly. Molly and Linda both
started for school immediately after an early breakfast. Terence went
to town with his uncle, and Nora and her aunt were left alone. She had
earnestly hoped that she might have had one of her first important talks
with Mr. Hartrick before he left that morning; but he evidently had no
idea of giving her an opportunity. He spoke to her kindly, but seemed
to regard her already as quite one of the family, and certainly was not
disposed to alter his plans or put out his business arrangements on
her account. She resolved, with a slightly impatient sigh, to abide her
time, and followed her aunt into the morning-room, where the good lady
produced some fancywork, and asked Nora if she would like to help her
to arrange little squares for a large patchwork quilt which was to be
raffled for at a bazar shortly to be held in the place.

Nora gravely took the little bits of colored silk, and, under her aunt's
supervision, began to arrange them in patterns. She was not a neat
worker, and the task was by no means to her taste.

"What time ought I to write in order to catch the post?" she said,
breaking the stillness, and raising her lovely eyes to Mrs. Hartrick's
face.

"The post goes out many times in the day, Nora; but if you want to catch
the Irish mail, you must have your letter in the box in the hall by
half-past three. There is plenty of time, my dear, and you will find
notepaper and everything you require in the escritoire in the study. You
can always go there if you wish to write your letters."

"Thank you," answered Nora.

"When you are tired of work, you can go out and walk about the grounds.
I will take you for a drive this afternoon. I am sorry that you have
arrived just when the girls have gone back to school; but you and Linda
can have a good deal of fun in the evenings, you know."

"But why not Molly too?" asked Nora. She felt rather alarmed at
mentioning her elder cousin's name.

Mrs. Hartrick did not speak at all for a moment; then she gave a sigh.

"I am sorry to have to tell you, Nora, that Molly is by no means a good
girl. She is extremely rebellious and troublesome; and if this state of
things goes on much longer her father and I will be obliged to send her
to a very strict school as a boarder. We do not wish to do that, as my
husband does not approve of boarding-schools for girls. At present she
is spending a good deal of her time in punishment."

"I hope she won't be in punishment to-night," said Nora. "I like her so
much."

"Do you, my dear? I hope she won't influence you to become
insubordinate."

Nora felt restless, and some of the bits of colored silk fluttered to
the floor.

"Be careful, my dear Nora," said her aunt in a somewhat sharp voice;
"don't let those bits of silk get about on the carpet. I am most
particular that everything in the house should be kept neat and in
order. I will get you a little work-basket to keep your things in when
next I go upstairs."

"Thank you, Aunt Grace," answered Nora.

"And now, as we are alone," continued the good lady, "you might tell
me something of your life. Your uncle is very anxious that your mother
should come and pay us a visit. He is very much attached to his sister,
and it seems to me strange that they should not have met for so many
years. You have a beautiful place at home, Nora--have you not?"

"Yes," said Nora; "the place is"--she paused, and her voice took an
added emphasis--"beautiful."

"How emphatically you say it, dear! You have a pretty mode of speech,
although very, very Irish."

"I am Irish, you see, Aunt Grace," answered Nora.

"Yes, dear, you need scarcely tell me that; your brogue betrays you."

"But mother was always particular that I should speak correctly,"
continued the girl. "Does my accent offend you, Aunt Grace?"

"No, dear; your uncle and I both think it quite charming. But tell me
some more. Of course you are very busy just now with your studies, Nora.
A girl of your age--how old did you say you were--sixteen?--a girl of
your age has not a moment to lose in acquiring those things which are
essential to the education of an accomplished woman of the present day."

"I am afraid I shall shock you very much indeed, Aunt Grace, when I tell
you that my education is supposed to be finished."

"Finished!" said Mrs. Hartrick. She paused for a moment and stared full
at Nora. "I was astonished," she continued, "when your uncle suggested
that you should pay us a visit now. I said, as September had begun,
you would be going back to school; but you accepted the invitation, or
rather your mother did for you, without any allusion to your school.
You must have got on very well, Nora, to be finished by now. How many
languages do you know?"

"I can chatter in Irish after a fashion," said Nora; "and I am supposed,
after a fashion also, to know my own tongue."

"Irish!" said Mrs. Hartrick in a tone of quivering scorn. "I don't
mean anything of that sort. I allude to your acquaintance with French,
German, and Italian."

"I do know a very little French," said Nora; "that is, I can read one or
two books in French. Mother taught me what I know; but I do not know any
German or any Italian. I don't see that it matters," she continued, a
flush coming into her cheeks. "I should never talk German or Italian in
Ireland. I wouldn't be understood if I did."

"That has nothing to do with it, Nora; and your tone, my dear, without
meaning it, of course, was just a shade pert just now. It is essential
in the present day that all well-educated women should be able to speak
at least in three languages."

"Then I am sorry, Aunt Grace, for I am afraid you will despise me. I
shall never be well educated in that sense of the word."

Mrs. Hartrick was silent.

"I will speak to your uncle," she said after a pause. "While you are
here you can have lessons. It would be possible to arrange that you went
to school with Linda and Molly, and had French and German lessons while
there."

"But I don't expect to be very long in England," said Nora, a note of
alarm in her voice.

"Oh, my dear child, now that we have got you, we shall not allow you to
go in a hurry. It is such a nice change for you, too; this is your first
visit to England, is it not?"

"Yes, Aunt Grace."

"We won't let you go for some time, little Nora. Your brother is a dear
fellow; your uncle and I admire him immensely, and he is quite well
educated and so adaptable; and I am sure you would be the same, my dear,
when you have had the many chances which will be offered to you here.
You must look upon me as your real aunt, dear, and tell me anything that
you wish. Don't be shy of me, my love; I can quite understand that a
young girl, when she first leaves her mother, is rather shy."

"I never felt shy at home," answered Nora; "but then, you know, I was
more with father than with mother."

"More with your father! Does he stay at home all day, then?"

"He is always about the place; he has nothing else to do."

"Of course he has large estates."

"They are not so very large, Aunt Grace."

"Well, dear, that is a relative term, of course; but from your uncle's
description, and to judge from your mother's letters, it must be a very
large place. By the way, how does she manage her servants? She must have
a large staff at Castle O'Shanaghgan."

"I don't think we manage our servants particularly well," said Nora. "It
is true they all stay with us; but then we don't keep many."

"How many, dear?"

"There's Pegeen--she is the parlor-maid--and there's the cook--we do
change our cook sometimes, for mother is rather particular; then there
is the woman who attends to the fowls, and the woman who does the
washing, and--I think that is about all. Oh, there's the post-boy;
perhaps you would consider him a servant, but I scarcely think he ought
to be called one. We give him twopence a week for fetching the letters.
He is a very good little boy. He stands on his head whenever he sees me;
he is very fond of me, and that is the way he shows his affection. It
would make you laugh, Aunt Grace, if you saw Michael standing on his
head."

"It would make me shudder, you mean," said Mrs. Hartrick. "Really, Nora,
your account of your mother's home is rather disparaging; two or three
very rough servants, and no more. But I understood you lived in castle."

"Oh, a castle may mean anything; but it is not fair for you and Uncle
George to think we are rich, for we are very poor. And," continued
Nora, "for my part, I love to be poor." She stood up abruptly. In her
excitement all her bits of silk tumbled to the floor. "May I go out
and have a run, Aunt Grace?" she said. "I feel quite stiff. I am not
accustomed to being indoors for so long at a time."

"You can go out, Nora, if you like," said her aunt in a displeased
tone; "but, first, have the goodness to pick up all those bits you have
dropped."

Nora, with flushed cheeks, stooped and picked up the bits of silk. She
wrapped them in a piece of paper and put them on the table.

"You can stay out for an hour, my dear; but you are surely not going
without a hat."

"I never wear a hat at home," said Nora.

"You must run upstairs and fetch your hat," said Mrs. Hartrick.

Poor Nora never felt more tried in the whole course of her life.

"I shall get as bad as Molly if this goes on," she thought to herself.
