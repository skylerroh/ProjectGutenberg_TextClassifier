full of fresh roses, crimson, white, and pink.  I am afraid the rules
of the S. S. U. C. had been slightly relaxed to allow of Rose Red's
getting these flowers; certainly they grew nowhere in Hillsover except
in Professor Seccomb's garden!

"The girls wanted me to give you this, with a great deal of love from
us all," said Katy, feeling strangely embarrassed, and hardly venturing
to raise her eyes.  She set the basket on the table.  "We hope that
you will be happy," she added in a low voice, and moved toward the
door.  Mrs. Florence had been to much surprised to speak, but now
she called, "Wait!  Come back a moment."

Katy came back.  Mrs. Florence's cheeks were flushed.  She looked very
handsome.  Katy almost thought there were tears in her eyes.

"Tell the girls that I thank them very much.  Their present is
beautiful.  I shall always value it."  She blushed as she spoke, and
Katy blushed too.  It made her shy to see the usually composed Mrs.
Florence so confused.

"What did she say?  What did she say?" demanded the others, who were
collected in groups round the school-room door to hear a report of
the interview.

Katy repeated her message.  Some of the girls were disappointed.

"Is that all?" they said.  "We thought she would stand up and make a
speech."

"Or a short poem," put in Rose Red,--"a few stanzas thrown off on the
spur of the moment; like this, for instance:--


                   "Thank you, kindly, for your basket,
                    Which I didn't mean to ask it;
                    But I'll very gladly take it,
                    And when 'tis full of cake, it
                    Will frequently remind me
                    Of the girls I left behind me!


There was a universal giggle, which brought Miss Jane out of the
school-room.

"Order!" she said, ringing the bell.  "Young ladies, what are you
about?  Study hour has begun."

"We're so sorry Mrs. Florence is going away," said some of the girls.

"How did you know that she is going?" demanded Miss Jane, sharply.
Nobody answered.

Next day Mrs. Florence left.  Katy saw her go with a secret regret.

"If only she would have said that she didn't believe I wrote that
note!" she told Clover.

"I don't care what she believes!  She's a stupid, unjust woman!"
replied independent little Clover.

Mrs. Nipson was now in sole charge of the establishment.  She had
never tried school-keeping before, and had various pet plans and
theories of her own, which she had only been waiting for Mrs.
Florence's departure to put into practice.

One of these was that the school was to dine three times a week on
pudding and bread and butter.  Mrs. Nipson had a theory,--very
convenient and economical for herself, but highly distasteful to her
scholars,--that it was injurious for young people to eat meat every
day in hot weather.

The puddings were made of batter, with a sprinkling of blackberries
or raisins.  Now, rising at six, and studying four hours and a half
on a light breakfast, has wonderful effect on the appetite, as all who
have tried it will testify.  The poor girls would go down to dinner
as hungry as wolves, and eye the large, pale slices on their plates
with a wrath and dismay which I cannot describe.  Very thick the
slices were, and there was plenty of thin, sugared sauce to eat with
them, and plenty of bread and butter; but, somehow, the whole was
unsatisfying, and the hungry girls would go upstairs almost as
ravenous as when they came down.  The second-table-ites were always
hanging over the balusters to receive them, and when to the demand,
"What did you have for dinner?" "Pudding!" was answered, a low groan
would run from one to another, and a general gloom seemed to drop
down and envelop the party.

It may have been in consequence of this experience of starvation that
the orders for fourth of July were that year so unusually large.  It
was an old custom in the school that the girls should celebrate the
National Independence by buying as many goodies as they liked.  There
was no candy-shop in Hillsover, so Mrs. Nipson took the orders, and
sent to Boston for the things, which were charged on the bills with
other extras.  Under these blissful circumstances, the girls felt
that they could afford to be extravagant, and made out their lists
regardless of expense.  Rose Red's, for this Fourth, ran thus:--

            "Two pounds of Chocolate Caramels.
             Two pounds of Sugar almonds.
             Two pounds of Lemon Drops.
             Two pounds of Mixed Candy.
             Two pounds of Maccaroons.
             A dozen Oranges.
             A dozen Lemons.
             A drum of Figs.
             A box of French Plums.
             A loaf of Almond Cake."

The result of this liberal order was that, after the great wash-basket
of parcels had been distributed, and the school had rioted for twenty-
four hours upon these unaccustomed luxuries, Rose was found lying on
her bed, ghastly and pallid.

"Never speak to me of any thing sweet again so long as I live!" she
gasped.  "Talk of vinegar, or pickles, or sour apples, but don't
allude to sugar in any form, if you love me!  Oh, why, why did I
send for those fatal things?"

In time all the candy was eaten up, and the school went back to its
normal condition.  Three weeks later came College commencement.

"Are you and Clover Craters or Symposiums?" demanded Lilly Page,
meeting Katy in the hall, a few days before this important event.

"What do you mean?"

"Why, has nobody told you about them?  They are the two great College
Societies.  All the girls belong to one or the other, and make the
wreaths to dress their halls.  We work up in the Gymnasium; the Crater
girls take the east side, and the Symposium girls the west, and when
the wreaths grow too long we hang them out of the windows.  It's the
greatest fun in the world!  Be a Symposium, do!  I'm one!"

"I shall have to think about it before deciding," said Katy, privately
resolving to join Rose Red's Society, whichever it was.  The Crater it
proved to be, so Katy and Clover enrolled themselves with the Craters.
Three days before Commencement wreath-making began.  The afternoons
were wholly given up to the work, and, instead of walking or piano
practice, the girls sat plaiting oak-leaves into garlands many yards
long.  Baskets of fresh leaves were constantly brought in, and there
was a strife between the rival Societies as to which should accomplish
most.

It was great fun, as Lilly had said, to sit there amid the green
boughs, and pleasant leafy smells, a buzz of gay voices in the air,
and a general sense of holiday.  The Gymnasium would have furnished
many a pretty picture for an artist during those three afternoons,
only, unfortunately, no artist was let in to see it.

One day, Rose Red, emptying a basket, lighted upon a white parcel,
hidden beneath the leaves.

"Lemon drops!" she exclaimed, applying finger and thumb with all the
dexterity of Jack Horner.  "Here, Crater girls, here's something for
you!  Don't you pity the Symposiums?"

But next day a big package of peppermints appeared in the Symposium
basket, so neither Society could boast advantage over the other.  They
were pretty nearly equal, too, in the quantity of wreath made,--the
Craters measuring nine hundred yards, and the Symposiums nine hundred
and two.  As for the Halls, which they were taken over to see the
evening before Commencement, it was impossible to say which was most
beautifully trimmed.  Each faction preferred its own, and President
Searles said that both did the young ladies credit.

They all sat in the gallery of the church on Commencement Day, and
heard the speeches.  It was very hot, and the speeches were not exactly
interesting, being on such subjects as "The Influence of a Republic on
Men of Letters," and "The Abstract Law of Justice, as applied to Human
Affairs;" but the music, and the crowd, and the spectacle of six hundred
ladies all fanning themselves at once, were entertaining, and the girls
would not have missed them for the world.  Later in the day another
diversion was afforded them by the throngs of pink and blue ladies
and white-gloved gentlemen who passed the house, on their way to the
President's Levee; but they were not allowed to enjoy this amusement
long, for Miss Jane, suspecting what was going on, went from room to
room, and ordered everybody summarily off to bed.

With the close of Commencement Day, a deep sleep seemed to settle
over Hillsover.  Most of the Professors' families went off to enjoy
themselves at the mountains or the sea-side, leaving their houses shut
up.  This gave the village a drowsy and deserted air.  There were no
boys playing balls on the Common, or swinging on the College fence;
no look of life in the streets.  The weather continued warm, the
routine of study and excercise grew dull, and teachers and scholars
alike were glad when the middle of September arrived, and with it
the opening of the autumn vacation.




CHAPTER IX.  THE AUTUMN VACATION.


The last day of the term was one of confusion.  Every part of the
house was given over to trunks and packing.  Mrs. Nipson sat at her
desk making out bills, and listening to requests about rooms and
room-mates.  Miss Jane counted books and atlases, taking note of
each ink-spot and dog-eared page.  The girls ran about, searching
for missing articles, deciding what to take home and what to leave,
engaging each other for the winter walks.  All rules were laid aside.
The sober Nunnery seemed turned into a hive of buzzing bees.  Bella
slid twice down the baluster of the front stairs without being
reproved, and Rose Red threw her arm round Katy's waist and waltzed
the whole length of Quaker Row.

"I'm so happy that I should like to scream!" she announced, as their
last whirl brought them up against the wall.  "Isn't vacation just
lovely?  Katy, you don't look half glad."

"We're not going home, you know," replied Katy, in rather a doleful
tone.  She and Clover were not so enraptured at the coming of vacation
as the rest of the girls.  Spending a month with Mrs. Page and Lilly
was by no means the same thing as spending it with papa and the
children.

Next morning, however, when the big stage drove up, and the girls
crowded in; when Mrs. Nipson stood in the door-way, blandly waving
farewell, and the maids flourished their dusters out of the upper
windows, they found themselves sharing the general excitement, and
joining heartily in the cheer which arose as the stage moved away.
The girls felt so happy and good-natured that some of them even
kissed their hands to Miss Jane.

Such a wild company is not often met with on a railroad train.  They
all went together as far as the Junction: and Mr. Gray, Ellen's father,
who had been put in charge of the party by Mrs. Nipson, had his hands
full to keep them in any sort of order.  He was a timid old gentleman,
and, as Rose suggested, his expression resembled that of a sedate hen
who suddenly finds herself responsible for the conduct of a brood of
ducklings.

"My dear, my dear!" he feebly remonstrated, "would you buy any more
candy?  Do you not think so many pea-nuts may be bad for you?"

"Oh, no, sir!" replied Rose, "they never hurt me a bit.  I can eat
thousands!"  Then, as a stout lady entered the car, and made a motion
toward the vacant seat beside her, she rolled her eyes wildly, and
said, "Excuse me, but perhaps I had better take the end seat so as
to get out easily in case I have a fit."

"Fits!" cried the stout lady, and walked away with the utmost dispatch.
Rose gave a wicked chuckle, the girls tittered, and Mr. Gray visibly
trembled.

"Is she really afflicted in this way?" he whispered.

"Oh, no, papa! it's only Rose's nonsense!" apologized Ellen, who was
laughing as hard as the rest.  But Mr. Gray did not feel comfortable,
and he was very glad when they reached the Junction, and half of his
troublesome charge departed on the branch road.

At six o'clock they arrived in Springfield.  Half a dozen papas were
waiting for their daughters, trains stood ready, there was a clamor of
good-bys.  Mr. Page was absorbed by Lilly, who kissed him incessantly,
and chattered so fast that he had no eyes for any one else.  Louisa
was borne away by an uncle, with whom she was to pass the night, and
Katy and Clover found themselves left alone.  They did not like to
interrupt Lilly, so they retreated to a bench, and sat down feeling
rather left-out and home-sick; and, though they did not say so, I am
sure that each was thinking about papa.

It was only for a moment.  Mr. Page spied them, and came up with such
a kind greeting that the forlorn feeling fled at once.  They were to
pass the night at the Massasoit, it seemed; and he collected their
bags, and led the way across the street to the hotel, where rooms
were already engaged for them.

"Now for waffles," whispered Lilly, as they went upstairs; and when,
after a few minutes of washing and brushing, they came down again into
the dining-room, she called for so many things, and announced herself
"starved" in such a tragical tone, that two amused waiters at once
flew to the rescue, and devoted themselves to supplying her wants.
Waffle after waffle--each hotter and crisper than the last--did those
long-suffering men produce, till even Lilly's appetite gave out, and
she was forced to own that she could not swallow another morsel.
This climax reached, they went into the parlor, and the girls sat
down in the window to watch the people in the street, which, after
quiet Hillsover, looked as brilliant and crowded as Broadway.

There were not many persons in the parlor.  A grave-looking couple sat
at a table at some distance, and a pretty little boy in a velvet jacket
was playing around the room.  He seemed about five years old; and Katy,
who was fond of children, put out her hand as he went by, caught him,
and lifted him into her lap.  He did not seem shy, but looked her in
the face composedly, like a grown person.

"What is your name, dear?" she asked.

"Daniel D'Aubigny Sparks," answered the little boy,  His voice was prim
and distinct.

"Do you live at this hotel?"

"Yes, ma'am.  I reside here with my father and mother."

"And what do you do all day?  Are there some other little boys for you
to play with?"

"I do not wish to play with any little boys," replied Daniel D'Aubigny,
in a dignified tone: "I prefer to be with my parents.  To-day we have
taken a walk.  We went to see a beautiful conservatory outside the city.
There is a Victoria Regia there.  I had often heard of this wonderful
lily, and in the last number of the London 'Musee' there is a picture
of it, represented with a small negro child standing upon one of its
leaves.  My father said that he did not think this possible, but when
we saw the plant we perceived that the print was not an exaggeration.
Such is the size of the leaf, that a small negro child might very
easily supported upon it."

"Oh, my!" cried Katy, feeling as if she had accidentally picked up an
elderly gentleman or a college professor.  "Pray, how old are you?"

"Nearly nine, ma'am," replied the little fellow with a bow.

Katy, too much appalled for farther speech, let him slide off her lap.
But Mr. Page, who was much diverted, continued the conversation; and
Daniel, mounting a chair, crossed his short legs, and discoursed with
all the gravity of an old man.  The talk was principally about himself,
--his tastes, his adventures, his ideas about art and science.  Now and
then he alluded to his papa and mamma, and once to his grandfather.
