    If false and faithless he withhold the dower,
    And grudge thy marriage, learn the deed to rue,
And taste at length and try what Turnus armed can do."

LX. Then he in scorn: "Yea, Tiber's waves beset
    With foreign ships--I know it; wherefore feign
    For me such terrors? Juno guards me yet.
    Good mother, dotage wears thee, and thy brain
    Is rusty; age hath troubled thee in vain,
    And, 'midst the feuds of monarchs, mocks with fright
    A priestess. Go; 'tis thine to guard the fane
    And sacred statues; these be thy delight;
Leave peace and war to men, whose business is to fight."

LXI. Therewith in fire Alecto's wrath outbroke,
    A sudden tremor through his limbs ran fast,
    His stony eyeballs stiffened as he spoke.
    So hissed the Fury with her snakes, so vast
    Her shape appeared, so fierce the look she cast,
    As back she thrust him with her flaming eyes,
    Fain to say more, but faltering and aghast.
    Two serpents from her Gorgon locks uprise;
Shrill sounds her scorpion lash, as, foaming, thus she cries:

LXII. "Behold me, worn with dotage! me, whom age
    Hath rusted, and, while monarchs fight, would scare
    With empty fears! Behold me in my rage!
    I come, the Furies' minister; see there,
    War, death and havoc in these hands I bear."
    Full at his breast a firebrand, as she spoke,
    Black with thick smoke, but bright with lurid glare,
    The Fiend outflung. In terror he awoke,
And o'er his bones and limbs a clammy sweat outbroke.

LXIII. "Arms, arms!" he yells, and searches for his sword
    In couch and chamber, maddening at the core
    With war's fierce passion, and the lust abhorred
    Of slaughter, and with bitter wrath yet more.
    As when a wood-fire crackles with fierce roar,
    Heaped round a caldron, and the simmering stream
    Foams, fumes, and bubbles, and at last boils o'er,
    And upward shoots the mingled smoke and steam;
So Turnus boils with wrath, so dire his rage doth seem.

LXIV. Choice youths he sends, to let Latinus know
    The peace was torn, then musters his array
    To guard Italia and expel the foe.
    Let Trojans league with Latins as they may,
    Himself can match them, and he comes to slay.
    So saying, his vows he renders. Ardour fires
    The fierce Rutulians, and each hails the fray;
    And one his youth, and one his grace admires,
And one his valorous deeds, and one his kingly sires.

LXV. So Turnus the Rutulians stirred to war.
    Meanwhile the Fury to the Trojans bent
    Her flight; with wily eye she marked afar,
    With snares and steeds upon the chase intent,
    Iulus. On his hounds at once she sent
    A sudden madness, and fierce rage awoke
    To chase the stag, as with the well-known scent
    She lured their nostrils.--Thus the feud outbroke;
So small a cause of strife could rustic hearts provoke.

LXVI. Broad-antlered, beauteous was the stag, which erst
    The sons of Tyrrheus (Tyrrheus kept whilere
    The royal herd and pastures), fostering nursed,
    Snatched from the dam. Their sister, Silvia fair,
    Oft wreathed his horns, and oft with tender care
    She washed him, and his shaggy coat would comb.
    So tamed, and trained his master's board to share,
    The gentle favourite in the woods would roam;
Each night, how late soe'er, he sought the well-known home.

LXVII. Him the fierce hounds now startle far astray,
    As down the stream he floats, or, crouching low,
    Rests on the green bank from the noontide ray.
    Athirst for praise, Ascanius bends his bow;
    Loud whirs the arrow, for Fate aims the blow,
    And cleaves his flank and belly. Homeward flies
    The wounded creature, moaning in his woe.
    Blood-stained, with piteous and imploring eyes,
Like one who sues for life, he fills the house with cries.

LXVIII. Smiting the breast, poor Silvia calls for aid.
    Forth rush the churls, scarce waiting her demand,
    Roused by the Fury in the wood's still shade.
    One grasps a club, another wields a brand;
    Rage makes a weapon of what comes to hand.
    Forth from his work ran Tyrrheus, who an oak
    Was cleaving with the wedge, and cheered the band.
    His hand still grasped the hatchet for the stroke,
And bitter wrath he breathed, and fierce the words he spoke.

LXIX. The Fury snatched the moment; forth she flew,
    And, perching on the cabin-roof, looked round,
    And from the curved horn of the shepherds blew
    A blast of Tartarus, that shook the ground,
    And made the forests and the groves rebound
    The infernal echoes. Trivia's lakes afar,
    And Velia's fountains heard the dreadful sound;
    The white waves heard it of the sulphurous Nar,
And mothers clasped their babes, and trembled at the war.

LXX. Swift at the summons, as the trumpet brayed,
    The sturdy shepherds arm them for the fray.
    Swift pour the Trojans from their camp, to aid
    Ascanius. Lo! 'tis battle's stern array,
    No village brawl, where churls dispute the day
    With charred oak-staves and cudgels. Broadswords clash
    With broadswords, and War's harvest far away
    Stands, bristling black with iron, as they dash
Together, and drawn swords in doubtful conflict flash.

LXXI. And brazen arms shoot many a blinding ray,
    Smit by the sun, as clouds that fill the sky,
    Disparting, show the splendours of the fray.
    As when a light wind o'er the sea doth fly,
    And the wave whitens as the breeze goes by,
    And by degrees the bosom of the deep
    Heaves up and swells, till higher and more high
    The billows rise, and, gathering in a heap,
From Ocean's caves mount up, and storm the ethereal steep.

LXXII. First falls the son of Tyrrheus, stretched in death,
    Young Almo. In his throat the deadly bane
    Stuck fast, and choked the humid pass of breath,
    And clipped the thin-spun life. There, too, is slain
    Grey-haired Galaesus, parleying but in vain.
    More righteous none, though many around lie killed,
    None wealthier did Ausonia's realm contain.
    Five herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures filled,
And with a hundred ploughs his fruitful lands he tilled.

LXXIII. Thus while the conflict wavered on the plain,
    The Fury, pleased her triumph to survey,
    Her pledge fulfilled,--War crimsoned with the stain
    Of gore, and grim Death busy with his prey,--
    Swift from Hesperia wings her airy way,
    And proudly speaks to Juno: "See, 'tis done;
    The discord perfect in the dolorous fray,
    And War with all its miseries begun.
Now bid, forsooth, the foes plight friendship and be one.

LXXIV. "Steeped are thy Trojans in Ausonian gore.
    Yet speak, and more will I perform, if so
    Thy purpose holds. Along the neighbouring shore
    Each town shall hear the rumour of the foe,
    Each breast with frenzy for the strife shall glow,
    Till all bring aid, and fruitful is the land
    In deeds of blood."--Then Juno: "Nay, not so;
    Enough of fraud and terror. Firmly stand
The causes of the feud; they battle hand to hand,

LXXV. "And fresh blood stains the weapons chance supplied.
    Such joy the bridal to Latinus bear,
    And Venus' wondrous offspring, and his bride.
    But thou--for scarce Olympus' king would bear
    Thy lawless roving in ethereal air,--
    Give place; myself will guide the rest aright."
    Saturnia spoke; Alecto then and there
    Her wings, that hiss with serpents, spreads for flight,
And to Cocytus dives, and leaves the realms of light.

LXXVI. In mid Italia lies a vale renowned,
    Amsanctus. Dark woods down the mountain grow
    This side and that; a torrent with the sound
    Of thunder roars among the rocks below.
    There, black as night, an awful cave they show,
    The gorge of Dis. Dread Acheron from beneath
    Bursts in a whirlpool, with its waves of woe,
    And jaws that gape with pestilential death.
There plunged the hateful Fiend, and earth and air took breath.

LXXVII. Nor less, meanwhile, Saturnia hastes to crown
    The war's mad tumult. Home the shepherds bore
    Their dead from out the battle to the town.
    Young Almo, and Galaesus, fouled with gore.
    All bid Latinus witness, and implore
    The gods, and while the blood-cry calls for flame
    And slaughter, Turnus swells the wild uproar.
    What! he an outcast? Shall the Trojans claim
The realm, and bastards dare the Latin race to shame?

LXXVIII. Then they, whose mothers through the pathless vales
    And forests, fired with Bacchic frenzy, ply
    Their orgies--so Amata's name prevails--
    Come forth, and, gathering from far and nigh,
    Weary the War-god with their clamorous cry,
    Till, thwarting Heaven's high purpose, each and all
    Omens at once and oracles defy,
    And swarm around Latinus in his hall,
War now is all their wish, "to arms" the general call.

LXXIX. Firm stands the monarch as a sea-girt rock,
    A sea-girt rock against the roaring main,
    Which, spite of barking billows and the shock
    Of Ocean, doth its own huge mass sustain.
    The foaming crags around it chafe in vain,
    And back it flings the seaweed from its side.
    Too weak at length their madness to restrain,
    For things move on as Juno's whims decide,
Oft to the gods, and oft to empty air he cried.

LXXX. "Ah me! the tempest hurries us along.
    Fate grinds us sore. Poor Latins! ye must sate,
    Your blood must pay, the forfeit for your wrong.
    Thee, Turnus, thee the avenging fiends await,
    Thou, too, the gods shalt weary, but too late.
    My rest is won, and in the port I ride;
    Happy in all, had not an envious fate
    Denied a happy ending." Thus he cried,
And to his chamber fled, and flung the crown aside.

LXXXI. A custom in Hesperian Latium reigned,
    Which Alban cities kept with sacred care,
    And Rome, the world's great mistress, hath retained.
    Thus still they wake the War-god, whensoe'er
    For Arabs or Hyrcanians they prepare,
    Or Getic tribes the tearful woes of war,
    Or push to Ind their distant arms, or dare
    To track the footsteps of the Morning star,
And claim their standards back from Parthia's hosts afar.

LXXXII. Twain are the Gates of War, to dreadful Mars
    With awe kept sacred and religious pride.
    A hundred brazen bolts and iron bars
    Shut fast the doors, and Janus stands beside.
    Here, when the senators on war decide,
    The Consul, decked in his Quirinal pall
    And Gabine cincture, flings the portals wide,
    And cries to arms; the warriors, one and all,
With blare of brazen horns make answer to the call.

LXXXIII. 'Twas thus that now Latinus they require
    To dare AEneas' followers to the fray,
    And ope the portals. But the good old Sire
    Shrank from the touch, and, shuddering with dismay,
    Shunned the foul office, and abjured the day.
    Then, downward darting from the skies afar,
    Heaven's empress with her right hand wrenched away
    The lingering bars. The grating hinges jar,
As back Saturnia thrusts the iron gates of War.

LXXXIV. Then woke Ausonia from her sleep. Forth swarm
    Footmen and horsemen, and in wild career
    Whirl up the dust. "Arm," cry the warriors, "arm!"
    With unctuous lard their polished shields they smear,
    And whet the axe, and scour the rusty spear.
    Their banners wave, their trumpets sound the fight.
    Five towns their anvils for the war uprear,
    Crustumium, Tibur, glorying in her might,
Ardea, Atina strong, Antemnae's tower-girt height.

LXXXV. Lithe twigs of osier in their shields they weave,
    And shape the casque, and in the mould prepare
    The brazen breastplate and the silver greave.
    Scorned lie the spade, the sickle and the share,
    Their fathers' falchions to the forge they bear.
    Now peals the clarion; through the host hath spread
    The watch-word. Helmets from the walls they tear,
    And yoke the steeds. In triple gold arrayed,
Each grasps the burnished shield, and girds the trusty blade.

LXXXVI. Now open Helicon; awake the strain,
    Ye Muses. Aid me, that the tale be told,
    What kings were roused, what armies filled the plain,
    What battles blazed, what men of valiant mould
    Graced fair Italia in those days of old.
    Aid ye, for ye are goddesses, and clear
    Can ye remember, and the tale unfold.
    But faint and feeble is the voice we hear,
A slender breath of Fame, that falters on the ear.

LXXXVII. First came with armed men from Etruria's coast
    Mezentius, scorner of the Gods. Next came
    His son, young Lausus, comeliest of the host,
    Save Turnus--Lausus, who the steed could tame,
    And quell wild beasts and track the woodland game.
    A hundred warriors from Agylla's town
    He leads--ah vainly! though he died with fame.
    Proud had he been and worthy to have known
A nobler sire's commands, a nobler sire to own.

LXXXVIII. With conquering steeds triumphant o'er the mead,
    His chariot, crowned with palm-leaves, proudly wheeled
    The comely Aventinus, glorious seed
    Of glorious Hercules; the blazoned shield
    His father's Hydra and her snakes revealed.
    Him, when of old, the monstrous Geryon slain,
    The lord of Tiryns, victor of the field,
    Reached in his wanderings the Laurentian plain,
And bathed in Tiber's stream the captured herds of Spain,

LXXXIX. The priestess Rhea, in the secret shade
    Of wooded Aventine, brought forth to light,
    A god commingling with a mortal maid.
    With pikes and poles his followers join the fight,
    Their swords are sharp, their Sabine spears are bright.
    Himself afoot, a lion's bristling hide
    With sharp teeth set in rows of glittering white,
    Swings o'er his forehead, as with eager stride,
Clad in his father's cloak, he seeks the monarch's side.

XC. Twin brothers came from Tibur--such the name
    Tiburtus gave it--one Catillus hight,
    And one fierce Coras, each of Argive fame,
    Each in the van, where deadliest raves the fight.
    As when two cloud-born Centaurs in their might
    From some tall mountain with swift strides descend,
    Steep Homole, or Othrys' snow-capt height;
    The thickets yield, trees crash, and branches bend,
As with resistless force the trampled woods they rend.

XCI. Nor lacked Praeneste's founder, Vulcan's child,
    Found on the hearthstone--if the tale be true,--
    Brave Caeculus, the Shepherds' monarch styled.
    Forth from Praeneste swarmed the rustic crew,
    From Juno's Gabium to the fight they flew,
    From ice-cold Anio, swoln with wintry rain,
    From Hernic rocks, which mountain streams bedew,
    From fat Anagnia's pastures, from the plain
Where Amasenus rolls majestic to the main.

XCII. With diverse arms they hasten to the war;
    Not all can boast the clashing of the shield,
    Not all the thunder of the rattling car.
    These sling their leaden bullets o'er the field,
    Those in each hand the deadly javelin wield.
    With caps of fur their rugged brows are dight,
    The tawny covering from the dark wolf peeled;
    Bare is the left foot, as they march to fight,
And, rough with raw bull's-hide, a sandal guards the right.

XCIII. Next came Messapus, tamer of the steed,
    Great Neptune's son. Fire nor the steel's sharp stroke
    Could lay him lifeless, so the Fates decreed.
    Grasping his sword, a laggard race he woke,
    Disused to war, and tardy to provoke.
    Behind him throng Fescennia's ranks to fight,
    Men from Flavinia, and Faliscum's folk,
    And those whom fair Capena's groves delight,
Ciminius' mount and lake, and steep Soracte's height.

XCIV. With measured tramp, their monarch's praise they sing,
    Like snowy swans, the liquid clouds among,
    Which homeward from their feeding ply the wing,
    When o'er Cayster's marish, loud and long,
    The echoes float of their melodious song.
    None, sure, such countless multitudes would deem
    The mail-clad warriors of an armed throng:
    Nay, rather, like a dusky cloud they seem
Of sea-fowl, landward driven with many a hoarse-voiced scream.

XCV. Lo, Clausus next; a mighty host he led,
    Himself a host. From Sabine sires he came,
    And Latium thence the Claudian house o'erspread,
    When Romans first with Sabines dared to claim
    Coequal lordship and a share of fame.
    With Amiternus came Eretum's band;
    From fair Velinus' dewy fields they came,
    From olive-crowned Mutusca, from the land
Where proud Nomentum's towers the fruitful plains command.

XCVI. From the rough crags of Tetrica came down
    Her hosts; they came from tall Severus' flank,
    From Foruli and fam'd Casperia's town,
    Wash'd by Himella's waves, and those who drank
    Of Fabaris, or dwelt on Tiber's bank.
    Those, too, whom Nursia sendeth from the snows,
    And Horta's sons, in many an ordered rank,
    And tribes of Latin origin, and those
Between whose parted fields th' ill-omened Allia flows.

XCVII. As roll the billows on the Libyan deep,
    When fierce Orion in the wintry main
    Sinks, dark with tempests, and the waves upleap;
    As, parched with suns of summer, stands the grain
    On Hermus' fields, or Lycia's golden plain;
    So countless swarm the multitudes around
    Bold Clausus, and the wide air rings again
    With echoes, as their clashing shields resound,
And with the tramp of feet they shake the trembling ground.

XCVIII. There Agamemnon's kinsman yokes his steeds,
    Halaesus. Trojans were his foes, his friend
    Was Turnus. Lo, a thousand tribes he leads;
    Those who on Massic hills the vineyards tend,
    Those whom Auruncans from their mountains send.
    From Sidicinum and her neighbouring plain,
    From Cales, from Volturnus' shoals they wend.
    From steep Saticulum the sturdy swain,
Fierce for the fray, comes down and joins the Oscan train.

XCIX. Light barbs they fling, from pliant thongs of hide,
    A leathern target o'er the left is strung,
    And short, curved daggers the close fight decide.
    Nor, OEbalus, those gallant hosts among,
    Shalt thou go nameless, and thy praise unsung,
    Thou, from old Telon, as the tale hath feigned,
    And beauteous Sebethis, the wood-nymph, sprung,
    O'er Teleboan Caprea when he reigned;
But Caprea's narrow realm proud OEbalus disdained.

C.  Far stretched his rule; Sarrastians owned his sway,
    And they, whose lands the Sarnian waters drain,
    And they, who till Celenna's fields, and they
    Whom Batulum and Rufrae's walls contain,
    And where through apple-orchards o'er the plain
    Shines fair Abella. Deftly can they wield
    Their native arms; the Teuton's lance they strain;
    Bark helmets guard them, from the cork-tree peeled,
And brazen are their swords, and brazen every shield.

CI. From Nersa's hills, by prosperous arms renowned,
    Comes Ufens, with his AEquians, in array.
    Rude huntsmen these; in arms the stubborn ground
    They till, themselves as stubborn. Day by day
    They snatch fresh plunder, and they live by prey.
    There, too, brave Umbro, of Marruvian fame,
    Sent by his king Archippus, joins the fray.
    Around his helmet, for in arms he came,
The auspicious olive's leaves the sacred priest proclaim.

CII. The rank-breath'd Hydra and the viper's rage
    With hand and voice he lulled asleep; his art
    Their bite could heal, their fury could assuage.
    Alas! no medicine can heal the smart
    Wrought by the griding of the Dardan dart.
    Nor Massic herbs, nor slumberous charms avail
    To cure the wound, that rankles in his heart.
    Ah, hapless! thee Anguitia's bowering vale,
Thee Fucinus' clear waves and liquid lakes bewail!

CIII. Next came to war Hippolytus' fair child,
    The comely Virbius, whom Aricia bore
    Amid Egeria's grove, where rich and mild
    Stands Dian's altar on the meadowy shore.
    For when (Fame tells) Hippolytus of yore
    Was slain, the victim of a stepdame's spite,
    And, torn by frightened horses, quenched with gore
    His father's wrath, famed Paeon's herbs of might
And Dian's fostering love restored him to the light.

CIV. Wroth then was Jove, that one of mortal clay
    Should rise by mortal healing from the grave,
    And change the nether darkness for the day,
    And him, whose leechcraft thus availed to save,
    Hurled with his lightning to the Stygian wave.
    But kind Diana, in her pitying love,
    Concealed her darling in a secret cave,
    And fair Egeria nursed him in her grove,
Far from the view of men, and wrath of mighty Jove.

CV. There, changed in name to Virbius, but to fame
    Unknown, through life in Latin woods he strayed.
    Thenceforth, in memory of the deed of shame,
    No horn-hoof'd steeds are suffered to invade
    Chaste Trivia's temple or her sacred glade,
    Since, scared by Ocean's monsters, from his car
    They dashed him by the deep. Yet, undismayed,
    His son, young Virbius, o'er the plains afar
The fleet-horsed chariot drives, and hastens to the war.

CVI. High in the forefront towered with stately frame
    Turnus himself. His three-plumed helmet bore
    A dragon fierce, that breathed AEtnean flame.
    The bloodier waxed the battle, so the more
    Its fierceness blazed, the louder was its roar.
    Behold, the heifer on his shield, the sign
    Of Io's fate; there Argus ever o'er
    The virgin watches, and the stream doth shine,
Poured from the pictured urn of Inachus divine.

CVII. Next come the shielded footmen in a cloud,
    Auruncan bands, Sicanians famed of yore,
    Argives, Rutulians, and Sacranians proud.
    Their painted shields the brave Labicians bore;
    From Tibur's glades, from blest Numicia's shore,
    From Circe's mount, from where great Jove presides
    O'er Anxur, from Feronia's grove they pour,
    From Satura's dark pool, where Ufens glides
Cold through the deepening vales, and mingles with the tides.

CVIII. Last came Camilla, with the Volscian bands,
    Fierce horsemen, each in glittering arms bedight,
    A warrior-virgin; ne'er her tender hands
    Had plied the distaff; war was her delight,
    Her joy to race the whirlwind and to fight.
    Swift as the breeze, she skimmed the golden grain,
    Nor bent the tapering wheatstalks in her flight,
    So swift, the billows of the heaving main
Touched not her flying fleet, she scoured the watery plain.

CIX. Forth from each field and homestead, hurrying, throng,
    With wonder, men and matrons, young and old,
    And greet the maiden as she moves along.
    Entranced with greedy rapture, they behold
    Her royal scarf, in many a purple fold,
    Float o'er her shining shoulders, and her hair
    Bound in a coronal of clasping gold,
    Her Lycian quiver, and her pastoral spear
Of myrtle, tipt with steel, and her, the maid, how fair!
