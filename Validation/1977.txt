    In the West this is quite a problem, for, when many thousands of
    these animals pass through a forest (Fig. 134), there is often very
    little young growth left and the future reproduction of the forest
    is severely retarded. Grazing on our National Forests is regulated
    by the Government.

    As a means of protection against insects and fungi, all trees
    infested are removed as soon as observed and in advance of all
    others, whenever a lumbering operation is undertaken.

[Illustration: FIG. 135.--A Typical Montana Sawmill.]

How forests are harvested: Forestry and forest preservation require that
    a forest should be cut and not merely held untouched. But it also
    demands that the cutting shall be done on scientific principles, and
    that only as much timber shall be removed in a given time as the
    forest can produce in a corresponding period. After the cutting, the
    forest must be left in a condition to produce another crop of
    timber within a reasonable time: see Fig. 122. These fundamental
    requirements represent the difference between conservative lumbering
    and ordinary lumbering. Besides insuring a future supply of timber,
    conservative lumbering, or lumbering on forestry principles, also
    tends to preserve the forest floor and the young trees growing on
    it, and to prevent injury to the remaining trees through fire,
    insects and disease. It provides for a working plan by which the
    kind, number and location of the trees to be cut are specified, the
    height of the stumps is stipulated and the utilization of the wood
    and by-products is regulated.

    Conservative lumbering provides that the trees shall be cut as near
    to the ground as possible and that they shall be felled with the
    least damage to the young trees growing near by. The branches of the
    trees, after they have been felled, must be cut and piled in heaps,
    as shown in Fig. 122, to prevent fire. When the trunks, sawed into
    logs, are dragged through the woods, care is taken not to break down
    the young trees or to injure the bark of standing trees. Waste in
    the process of manufacture is provided against, uses are found for
    the material ordinarily rejected, and the best methods of handling
    and drying lumber are employed. Fig. 135 shows a typical sawmill
    capable of providing lumber in large quantities.

    In the utilization of the by-products of the forest, such as
    turpentine and resin, Forestry has devised numerous methods for
    harvesting the crops with greater economy and with least waste and
    injury to the trees from which the by-products are obtained. Fig.
    136 illustrates an improved method by which crude turpentine is
    obtained.

[Illustration: FIG. 136.--Gathering Crude Turpentine by the Cup and
Gutter Method. This system, devised by foresters, saves the trees and
increases the output.]

Forestry here and abroad: Forestry is practiced in every civilized
    country except China and Turkey. In Germany, Forestry has attained,
    through a long series of years, a remarkable state of scientific
    thoroughness and has greatly increased the annual output of the
    forests of that country.

    In France, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Norway, Sweden, Russia
    and Denmark, Forestry is also practiced on scientific principles and
    the government in each of these countries holds large tracts of
    forests in reserve. In British India one finds a highly efficient
    Forest Service and in Japan Forestry is receiving considerable
    attention.

    In the United States, the forest areas are controlled by private
    interests, by the Government and by the States. On privately owned
    forests, Forestry is practiced only in isolated cases. The States
    are taking hold of the problem very actively and in many of them we
    now find special Forestry Commissions authorized to care for vast
    areas of forest land reserved for State control. These Commissions
    employ technically trained foresters who not only protect the State
    forests, but also plant new areas, encourage forest planting on
    private lands and disseminate forestry information among the
    citizens. New York State has such a Commission that cares for more
    than a million acres of forest land located in the northern part of
    the State. Many other States are equally progressive.

    The United States Government is the most active factor in the
    preservation of our forests. The Government to-day owns over two
    hundred million acres of forest land, set aside as National Forests.
    There are one hundred and fifty individual reserves, distributed as
    shown in Fig. 137 and cared for by the Forest Service, a bureau in
    the Department of Agriculture. Each of the forests is in charge of a
    supervisor. He has with him a professional forester and a body of
    men who patrol the tract against fire and the illegal cutting of
    timber. Some of the men are engaged in planting trees on the open
    areas and others in studying the important forest problems of the
    region. Fig. 138.

Growth and Habits of Trees. They are standing in water three feet deep.]

    Where cutting is to be done on a National Forest, the conditions are
    investigated by a technically trained forester and the cutting is
    regulated according to his findings. Special attention is given to
    discovering new uses for species of trees which have hitherto been
    considered valueless, and the demand upon certain rare species is
    lessened by introducing more common woods which are suitable for use
    in their place.

    Aside from the perpetuation of the national forests, the U.S.
    Forest Service also undertakes such tree studies as lie beyond the
    power or means of private individuals. It thus stands ready to
    cooperate with all who need assistance.



STUDY II. CARE OF THE WOODLAND

Almost every farm, large private estate or park has a wooded area for
the purpose of supplying fuel or for enhancing the landscape effect of
the place. In most instances these wooded areas are entirely neglected
or are so improperly cared for as to cause injury rather than good. In
but very few cases is provision made for a future growth of trees after
the present stock has gone. Proper attention will increase and
perpetuate a crop of good trees just as it will any other crop on the
farm, while the attractiveness of the place may be greatly enhanced
through the intelligent planting and care of trees.

How to judge the conditions: A close examination of the wooded area may
    reveal some or all of the following unfavorable conditions:

    The trees may be so crowded that none can grow well. A few may have
    grown to large size but the rest usually are decrepit, and
    overtopped by the larger trees. They are, therefore, unable, for the
    want of light and space, to develop into good trees. Fig. 139 shows
    woodland in such condition.

[Illustration: FIG. 139.--Woodland which Needs Attention. The trees are
overcrowded.]

    There may also be dead and dying trees, trees infested with
    injurious insects and fungi and having any number of decayed
    branches. The trees may be growing so far apart that their trunks
    will be covered with suckers as far down as the ground, or there may
    be large, open gaps with no trees at all. Here the sun, striking
    with full force, may be drying up the soil and preventing the
    decomposition of the leaves. Grass soon starts to grow in these open
    spaces and the whole character of the woodland changes as shown in
    Figs. 140 and 141.

[Illustration: FIG. 140.--First Stage of Deterioration. The woodland is
too open and grass has taken the place of the humus cover.]

    Where any of these conditions exist, the woodland requires
    immediate attention. Otherwise, as time goes on, it deteriorates
    more and more, the struggle for space among the crowded and
    suppressed trees becomes more keen, the insects in the dying trees
    multiply and disease spreads from tree to tree. Under such
    conditions, the soil deteriorates and the older trees begin to
    suffer.

[Illustration: FIG. 141.--Second Stage of Deterioration. The Surface
Soil of the Wooded Area Has Washed Away and the Trees Have Died.]

    The attention required for the proper care of woodland may be summed
    up under the four general heads of _soil preservation_, _planting_,
    _cutting_, and _protection_.

Improvement by soil preservation: The soil in a wooded area can best be
    preserved and kept rich by doing two things; by retaining the
    fallen leaves on the ground and by keeping the ground well covered
    with a heavy growth of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. The
    fallen leaves decompose, mix with the soil and form a dark-colored
    material known as _humus_. The humus supplies the tree with a
    considerable portion of its food and helps to absorb and retain the
    moisture in the soil upon which the tree is greatly dependent. A
    heavy growth of trees and shrubs has a similar effect by serving to
    retain the moisture in the soil.

Improvement by planting: The planting of new trees is a necessity on
    almost any wooded area. For even where the existing trees are in
    good condition, they cannot last forever, and provision must be made
    for others to take their place after they are gone. The majority of
    the wooded areas in our parks and on private estates are not
    provided with a sufficient undergrowth of desirable trees to take
    the place of the older ones. Thus, also, the open gaps must be
    planted to prevent the soil from deteriorating.

    Waste lands on farms which are unsuited for farm crops often offer
    areas on which trees may profitably be planted. These lands are
    sufficiently good in most cases to grow trees, thus affording a
    means of turning into value ground which would otherwise be
    worthless. It has been demonstrated that the returns from such
    plantations at the end of fifty years will yield a six per cent
    investment and an extra profit of $151.97 per acre, the expense
    totaling at the end of fifty years, $307.03. The value of the land
    is estimated at $4 per acre and the cost of the trees and planting
    at $7 per acre. The species figured on here is white pine, one of
    the best trees to plant from a commercial standpoint. With other
    trees, the returns will vary accordingly.

[Illustration: FIG. 142.--A Farm Woodlot.]

    The usual idea that it costs a great deal to plant several thousand
    young trees is erroneous. An ordinary woodlot may be stocked with a
    well-selected number of young trees at a cost less than the price
    generally paid for a dozen good specimen trees for the front lawn.
    It is not necessary to underplant the woodlot with big trees. The
    existing big trees are there to give character to the forest and the
    new planting should be done principally as a future investment and
    as a means of perpetuating the life of the woodlot. Young trees are
    even more desirable for such planting than the older and more
    expensive ones. The young trees will adapt themselves to the local
    soil and climatic conditions more easily than the older ones. Their
    demand for food and moisture is more easily satisfied, and because
    of their small cost, one can even afford to lose a large percentage
    of them after planting.

    The young plants should be two-year-old seedlings or three-year-old
    "transplants."

    Two-year-old seedlings are trees that have been grown from the seed
    in seed beds until they reach that age. They run from two to fifteen
    inches in height, depending upon the species.

    Three-year-old "transplants" have been grown from the seed in seed
    beds and at the end of the first or second year have been taken up
    and transplanted into rows, where they grow a year or two longer.
    They are usually a little taller than the two-year-old seedlings,
    are much stockier and have a better root system. For this reason,
    three-year-old transplants are a little more desirable as stock for
    planting. They will withstand drought better than seedlings.

    The best results from woodland planting are obtained with
    native-grown material. Such stock is stronger, hardier and better
    acclimated. Foreign-grown stock is usually a little cheaper, owing
    to the fact that it has been grown abroad, under cheap labor
    conditions.

    The trees may be purchased from reputable dealers, of whom there are
    many in this country. These dealers specialize in growing young
    trees and selling them at the low cost of three to ten dollars per
    thousand. In States in which a Forestry Commission has been
    inaugurated, there have also been established State nurseries where
    millions of little trees are grown for reforestation purposes. In
    order to encourage private tree planting, the Forestry Commissions
    are usually willing to sell some of these trees at cost price, under
    certain conditions, to private land owners. Inquiries should be
    made to the State Forestry Commission.

    Great care must be taken to select the species most suitable for the
    particular soil, climatic and light conditions of the woodlot. The
    trees which are native to the locality and are found growing
    thriftily on the woodlot, are the ones that have proven their
    adaptability to the local conditions and should therefore be the
    principal species used for underplanting. A list from which to
    select the main stock would, therefore, vary with the locality. In
    the Eastern States it would comprise the usual hardy trees like the
    red, pin and scarlet oaks, the beech, the red and sugar maples, the
    white ash, the tulip tree, sycamore, sweet gum and locust among the
    deciduous trees; the white, Austrian, red, pitch and Scotch pines,
    the hemlock and the yew among the conifers.

    With the main stock well selected, one may add a number of trees and
    shrubs that will give to the woodland scene a pleasing appearance at
    all seasons. The brilliant autumnal tints of the sassafras,
    pepperidge, blue beech, viburnum, juneberry and sumach are
    strikingly attractive. The flowering dogwood along the drives and
    paths will add a charm in June as well as in autumn and an
    occasional group of white birch will have the same effect if planted
    among groups of evergreens. Additional undergrowth of native
    woodland shrubs, such as New Jersey tea, red-berried elder and
    blueberry for the Eastern States, will augment the naturalness of
    the scene and help to conserve the moisture in the soil.

    Two or three years' growth will raise these plants above all grass
    and low vegetation, and a sprinkling of laurel, rhododendron, hardy
    ferns and a few intermingling colonies of native wild flowers such
    as bloodroot, false Solomon's seal and columbines for the East, as
    a ground cover will put the finishing touches to the forest scene.

    As to methods of planting the little trees, the following
    suggestions may prove of value. As soon as the plants are received,
    they should be taken from the box and dipped in a thick puddle of
    water and loam. The roots must be thoroughly covered with the mud.
    Then the bundles into which the little trees are tied should be
    loosened and the trees placed in a trench dug on a slant. The dirt
    should be placed over the roots and the exposed parts of the plants
    covered with brush or burlap to keep away the rays of the sun.

    When ready for planting, a few plants are dug up, set in a pail with
    thin mud at the bottom and carried to the place of planting. The
    most economical method of planting is for one man to make the holes
    with a mattock. These holes are made about a foot in diameter, by
    scraping off the sod with the mattock and then digging a little hole
    in the dirt underneath. A second man follows with a pail of plants
    and sets a single plant in this hole with his hands, see Fig. 129,
    making sure that the roots are straight and spread out on the bottom
    of the hole. The dirt should then be packed firmly around the plant
    and pressed down with the foot.

Improvement by cutting: The removal of certain trees in a grove is often
    necessary to improve the quality of the better trees, increase their
    growth, make the place accessible, and enhance its beauty. Cutting
    in a wooded area should be confined to suppressed trees, dead and
    dying trees and trees badly infested with insects and disease. In
    case of farm woodlands, mature trees of market value may be cut, but
    in parks and on private estates these have a greater value when left
    standing. The cutting should leave a clean stand of well-selected
    specimens which will thrive under the favorable influence of more
    light and growing space. Considerable care is required to prevent
    injury to the young trees when the older specimens are cut and
    hauled out of the woods. The marking of the trees to be removed can
    best be done in summer when the dead and live trees can be
    distinguished with ease and when the requisite growing space for
    each tree can be judged better from the density of the crowns. The
    cutting, however, can be done most advantageously in winter.

    Immediately after cutting all diseased and infested wood should be
    destroyed. The sound wood may be utilized for various purposes. The
    bigger logs may be sold to the local lumber dealers and the smaller
    material may be used for firewood. The remaining brush should be
    withdrawn from the woodlot to prevent fire during the dry summer
    months.

    In marking trees for removal, a number of considerations are to be
    borne in mind besides the elimination of dead, diseased and
    suppressed trees. When the marker is working among crowding trees of
    equal height, he should save those that are most likely to grow into
