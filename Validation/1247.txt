HOLY COMMUNION

Jesus, Thou art coming

Acts before Communion
From a Slovak Hymnal


Moderato

1.
Jesus Thou art coming,
Holy as Thou art
Thou the God who made me,
To my sinful heart.
Jesus, I believe it
On Thy only word;
Kneeling I adore Thee
As my King and Lord.

2.
Who am I, my Jesus,
That Thou com'st to me?
I have sinned against Thee,
Often, grievously;
I am very sorry
I have caused Thee pain;
I will never, never,
Wound Thy Heart again.

3. Trust

Put Thy kind arms round me,
Feeble as I am;
Thou art my Good Shepherd,
I, Thy little lamb;
Since Thou comest, Jesus,
Now to be my Guest,
I can trust Thee always,
Lord, for all the rest.

4. Love and Desire

Dearest Lord, I love Thee,
With my whole, whole heart,
Not for what Thou givest,
But for what Thou art.
Come, oh, come, sweet Saviour!
Come to me, and stay,
For I want Thee, Jesus,
More than I can say.

5. Offering and  Petition

Ah! What gift or present,
Jesus, can I bring?
I have nothing worthy
Of my God and King;
But Thou art my Shepherd,
I, Thy little lamb;
Take myself, dear Jesus,
All I have and am.

6.
Take my body, Jesus,
Eyes, and ears, and tongue;
Never let them, Jesus
Help to do Thee wrong.
Take my heart, and fill it
Full of love for Thee;
All I have I give Thee,
Give Thyself to me.

CONFIRMATION

My God, accept my heart this day

M. Bridges
Nicola. A. Montani


Slowly with devotion

1.
My God, accept my heart this day,
And make it always Thine,
That I from Thee no more may stray,
No more from Thee decline.

2.
Before the cross of Him who dies,
Behold I prostrate fall;
Let ev'ry sin be crucified,
Let Christ be all in all.

3.
Anoint me with Thy heav'nly grace,
Adopt me for Thine own,
That I may see Thy glorious face
And worship at Thy throne.

4.
May the dear blood, once shed for me,
My best atonement prove;
That I from first to last may be
The purchase of Thy love!

5.
Let ev'ry thought, and work, and word,
To Thee be ever giv'n
Then life shall be Thy service, Lord,
And death the gate of heav'n!

Jesus, my Lord! behold at length the time

Act of Contrition
Bishop Chadwick
Traditional Melody


Moderato

1.
Jesus, my Lord! Behold at length the time
When I resolve to turn away from crime.
Oh pardon me, Jesus: Thy mercy I implore;
I will never more offend Thee;

2.
Since my poor soul Thy precious Blood has cost
Suffer it not forever to be lost.
Oh pardon me, Jesus: Thy mercy I implore;
I will never more offend Thee; no, never more.

3.
Kneeling in tears, behold me at Thy feet
Like Magdalene, forgiveness I entreat.
Oh pardon me, Jesus: Thy mercy I implore;
I will never more offend Thee;

God of mercy and compassion

Rev. E. Vaughan
Nicola A. Montani


Moderato

1.
God of mercy and compassion!
Look with pity upon me;
Father! Let me call Thee Father,
'Tis Thy child returns to Thee.

Refrain
Jesus, Lord, I ask for mercy;
Let me not implore in vain;
All my sins I now detest them,
Never will I sin again.

2.
By my sins I have abandoned
Right and claim to Heav'n above,
Where the Saints rejoice forever
In a boundless sea of love.

3.
See our Saviour, bleeding, dying,
On the Cross of Calvary;
To the Cross my sins have nailed Him,
Yet He bleeds and dies for me.

Jesus, ever-loving Saviour

Hymn for a Happy Death
Franz Schubert
Arr. by N. A. M.


1.
Jesus, ever loving Saviour,
Thou didst live and die for me,
Living, I will live to love Thee,
Dying, I will die for Thee,
Jesus! Jesus!
By Thy death and sorrow,
Help me in my agony.

2.
When the last dread hour approaching
Fills my guilty soul with fear;
All my sins rise up before me,
All my virtues disappear.
Jesus! Jesus!
Turn not Thou in anger from me,
Mary, Joseph, then be near.

3.
Mary, thou canst not forsake me,
Virgin mother undefiled;
Thou didst not abandon Jesus
Dying, tortued and reviled.
Jesus! Jesus!
Send Thy Mother to console me:
Mary, help Thy guilty child!

4.
Jesus, when the cruel anguish
Dying on the shameful tree,
All abandoned by Thy Father,
Thuo didst writhe in agony.
Jesus! Jesus!
By these three long hours of sorrow
Thou didst purchase hope for me.

5.
Then, by all that Thou didst suffer,
Grant me mercy in that day;
Help me, Mary, my sweet Mother,
Holy Joseph, near me stay.
Jesus! Jesus!
Let me die, my lips repeating,
Jesus, mercy! Mary, pray!

Happy we who thus united

Rev. E. Vaughan
"Ave Virgo" 15th Century melody
Arr. by N. A. M.


Allegro moderato

1.
Happy we, who thus united
Join in cheerful melody;
Praising Jesus, Mary, Joseph,
In the "Holy Family."
Jesus, Mary, Joseph, help us,
That we ever true may be,
To the promises that bind us
To the "Holy Family."

2.
Jesus, Whose almighty bidding
All created things fulfill,
Lives on earth in meek subjection
To His earthly parents' will.
Sweetest Infant, make us patient
And obedient for Thy sake,
Each us to be chaste and gentle,
All our stormy passions break.

3.
Mary! thou alone were chosen
Virgin Mother of thy Lord:
Thou didst guide the earthly footsteps
Of the Great Incarnate Word.
Dearest Mother! Make us humble;
For thy Son will take His rest
In the poor and lowly dwelling
Of a humble sinner's breast.

4.
Joseph! Thou wert called the father
Of thy Maker and thy Lord;
Thine it was to save thy Saviour
From the cruel Herod's sword.
Suffer us to call thee father;
Show to us a father's love;
Lead us safe thro' ev'ry danger
Till we meet in heav'n above.

By the first bright Easter day,
When the stone was rolled away;

At Thy rising from the dead.

King of Glory, hear our cry;
Make us soon Thy joy to see,
Where enthroned in majesty
Countless angels sing to Thee.

By the cloud of living light
That received Thee out of sight.

Coming down from heaven's height;
By the cloven tongues of fire,

See the Virgin Mother rise,
Angels bear her to the skies;
Mount aloft, imperial Queen,
Plead on high the cause of men!

Mary reigns upon the throne
Preordained for her alone;
Saints and angels round her sing,
Mother of our God and King.

Sweet Saviour! bless us ere we go

Father Faber
Nicola A. Montani


Andante ma non troppo

1.
Sweet Saviour! Bless us ere we go;
Thy word into our minds instill;
And make our lukewarm hearts to glow
With lowly love and fervent will.

Refrain
Thro' life's long day
and deaths dark night,
O gentle Jesus! be our light;
Jesus! be our light.

2.
The day is done; its hours have run;
And Thou hast taken count of all,
The scanty triumphs grace hath won,
The broken vow, and frequent fall.

3.
Grant us, dear Lord! From evil ways
True absolution and release;
And bless us more than in past days
With purity and inward peace.

4.
For all we love, the poor, the sad,
The sinful, unto Thee we call;
Oh let Thy mercy make us glad;
Thou art out Jesus and our All.

To Thee our vows we humbly pay;
May we, 'mid joys that never end,
With Thy bright saints in homage bend.

GENERAL, Evening Hymn

When day's shadows lengthen
Mane nobiscum, quoniam ad vesperascit

Dr. F. G. Lee
Traditional Melody
Arr. by N. A. M.


Andante

1.
When day's shadows lengthen,
Jesus, be Thou near:
Pardon, comfort, strengthen,
Chase away my fear;
Love and hope be deepen'd,
Faith more strong and clear.

2.
When the night grows darkest,
And the stars are pale,
When the foemen gather
In death's misty vale,
Be Thou Sword and Buckler,
Be Thou Shield and Mail.

3.
Come, Thou Food of angels,
Source of ev'ry grace,
In Thy Father's mansions
Give me soon a place;
That unveiled in splendor
I may see Thy Face.

4.
Then be near me, Jesus,
Enemies shall flee:
Hidden God and Saviour,
Thou my comfort be:
Food, and Priest, and Victim,
