        When all the novelists and spinners of
        elaborate fictions have been read and judged,
        we shall find that the peasant and the nurse
        are still unsurpassed as mere narrators. They
        are the guardians of that treasury of legend
        which comes to us from the very childhood of
        nations; they and their tales are the abstract
        and brief chronicles, not of an age merely, but
        of the whole race of man. It is theirs to keep
        alive the great art of telling stories as a
        thing wholly apart from and independent of the
        art of writing stories, and to pass on their
        art to children and to children's children.
        They abide in a realm of their own, in blessed
        isolation from that world of professional
        authors and their milk-and-water books "for
        children."
