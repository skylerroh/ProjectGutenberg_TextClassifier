SPARROW. I cannot reach it. It is too low.

CROW. Stretch your neck!

SPARROW. I stretch and stretch--I cannot reach it.

CROW. Why, neither can I! Stretch as I will, I cannot reach it.

SPARROW. We must have water! What shall we do?

CROW. Ah, I know the way to get the water!

     (_He drops pebbles in the pitcher._)

SPARROW. Why do you drop pebbles in the pitcher?

     (_He drops in more pebbles; the water rises._)

Please tell me why you do that.

her. Lamb, Lamb, how dare you? How dare you?

LAMB. What do you mean, sir?

WOLF. How dare you muddle the water?

LAMB. The water is clear where you stand, sir.

WOLF. The water is muddled where I stand, miss.

LAMB. How can that be, sir?

WOLF. I say the water here is muddled.

LAMB. But, sir, the water runs from you to me.

WOLF. Oh, well, we will say no more about the water. Now just one year
ago you called me names.

[Illustration]

LAMB. How could that be, sir?

WOLF. I say you called me names, miss.

LAMB. But, sir, one year ago I was not born.

to eat you anyway.

cake.

[Illustration: "WILL YOU GIVE ME A CAKE?"]

Why, this too changes to crust! Ah me! The Fairy's words were true. I
would not give, I cannot have. Ah me! Ah me!
