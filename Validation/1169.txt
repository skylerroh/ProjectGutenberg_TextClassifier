ago in 1985, figuring by the earthly calendar of that time, a tribe of
beings from the Dog-star Sirius invaded the earth."

"And what did these beings look like, father?"

"Like humans in many, many respects. They each had two arms, two legs
and all the other organs that humans are endowed with."

"Wasn't there any difference at all between the Star-beings and the
humans, papa?"

"There was. The newcomers, each and all, had a pair of wings covered
with green feathers growing from their shoulders, and long, purple
tails."

"How many of these beings were there, father?"

"Exactly three million and forty-one male adults and three female
adults. These creatures first appeared on Earth on the island of
Sardinia. In five weeks' time they were the masters of the entire
globe."

"Didn't the Earth-lings fight back, papa?"

"The humans warred against the invaders, using bullets, ordinary
bombs, super-atom bombs and gases."

"What were those things like, father?"

"Oh, they've passed out of existence long ago. 'Ammunition' they were
called. The humans fought each other with such things."

"And not with ideas, like we do now, father?"

"No, with guns, just like I told you. But the invaders were immune to
the ammunition."

"What does 'immune' mean?"

"Proof against harm. Then the humans tried germs and bacteria against
the star-beings."

"What were those things?"

"Tiny, tiny bugs that the humans tried to inject into the bodies of the
invaders to make them sicken and die. But the bugs had no effect at all
on the star-beings."

"Go on, papa. These beings over-ran all Earth. Go on from there."

"You must know, these newcomers were vastly more intelligent than the
Earth-lings. In fact, the invaders were the greatest mathematicians in
the System."

"What's the System? And what does mathematician mean?"

"The Milky Way. A mathematician is one who is good at figuring,
weighing, measuring, clever with numbers."
