her father, doffed his bonnet, and made his reverence, not altogether so
low perhaps as if the young lady had appeared in the pride of rank and
riches, yet so as to give high birth the due homage which the Scotch for
a length of time scrupulously rendered to it.

Indeed, from having had her mother's example before her for so many
years, and from a native sense of propriety and even of dignity,
Mary Avenel had acquired a demeanour, which marked her title to
consideration, and effectually checked any attempt at familiarity on the
part of those who might be her associates in her present situation, but
could not be well termed her equals. She was by nature mild, pensive,
and contemplative, gentle in disposition, and most placable when
accidentally offended; but still she was of a retired and reserved
habit, and shunned to mix in ordinary sports, even--when the rare
occurrence of a fair or wake gave her an opportunity of mingling
with companions of her own age. If at such scenes she was seen for an
instant, she appeared to behold them with the composed indifference of
one to whom their gaiety was a matter of no interest, and who seemed
only desirous to glide away from the scene as soon as she possibly
could.

Something also had transpired concerning her being born on All-hallow
Eve, and the powers with which that circumstance was supposed to invest
her over the invisible world. And from all-these particulars combined,
the young men and women of the Halidome used to distinguish Mary among
themselves by the name of the Spirit of Avenel, as if the fair but
fragile form, the beautiful but rather colourless cheek, the dark blue
eye, and the shady hair, had belonged rather to the immaterial than
the substantial world. The general tradition of the White Lady, who was
supposed to wait on the fortunes of the family of Avenel, gave a sort of
zest to this piece of rural wit. It gave great offence, however, to
the two sons of Simon Glendinning; and when the expression was in
their presence applied to the young lady, Edward was wont to check the
petulance of those who used it by strength of argument, and Halbert by
strength of arm. In such cases Halbert had this advantage, that although
ho could render no aid to his brother's argument, yet when circumstances
required it, he was sure to have that of Edward, who never indeed
himself commenced a fray, but, on the other hand, did not testify any
reluctance to enter into combat in Halbert's behalf or in his rescue.

But the zealous attachment of the two youths, being themselves, from
the retired situation in which they dwelt, comparative strangers in
the Halidome, did not serve in any degree to alter the feelings of the
inhabitants towards the young lady, who seemed to have dropped amongst
them from another sphere of life. Still, however, she was regarded with
respect, if not with fondness; and the attention of the Sub-Prior to the
family, not to mention the formidable name of Julian Avenel, which every
new incident of those tumultuous times tended to render more famous,
attached to his niece a certain importance. Thus some aspired to her
acquaintance out of pride while the more timid of the feuars were
anxious to inculcate upon their children the necessity of being
respectful to the noble orphan. So that Mary Avenel, little loved
because little known, was regarded with a mysterious awe, partly derived
from fear of her uncle's moss-troopers, and partly from her own retired
and distant habits, enhanced by the superstitious opinions of the time
and country.

It was not without some portion of this awe, that Mysie felt herself
left alone in company with a young person so distant in rank, and so
different in bearing, from herself; for her worthy father had taken
the first opportunity to step out unobserved, in order to mark how the
barnyard was filled, and what prospect it afforded of grist to the mill.
In youth, however, there is a sort of free-masonry, which, without much
conversation, teaches young persons to estimate each other's character,
and places them at ease on the shortest acquaintance. It is only when
taught deceit by the commerce of the world, that we learn to shroud our
character from observation, and to disguise our real sentiments from
those with whom we are placed in communion.

Accordingly, the two young women were soon engaged in such objects of
interest as best became their age. They visited Mary Avenel's pigeons,
which she nursed with the tenderness of a mother; they turned over her
slender stores of finery, which yet contained some articles that excited
the respect of her companion, though Mysie was too good-humoured
to nourish envy. A golden rosary, and some female ornaments marking
superior rank, had been rescued in the moment of their utmost adversity,
more by Tibb Tacket's presence of mind, than by the care of their
owner,--who was at that sad period too much sunk in grief to pay
any attention to such circumstances. They struck Mysie with a deep
impression of veneration; for, excepting what the Lord Abbot and the
convent might possess, she did not believe there was so much real gold
in the world as was exhibited in these few trinkets, and Mary, however
sage and serious, was not above being pleased with the admiration of her
rustic companion.

Nothing, indeed, could exhibit a stronger contrast than the appearance
of the two girls;--the good-humoured laughter-loving countenance of
the Maid of the Mill, who stood gazing with unrepressed astonishment
on whatever was in her inexperienced eye rare and costly, and with an
humble, and at the same time cheerful acquiescence in her inferiority,
asking all the little queries about the use and value of the ornaments,
while Mary Avenel, with her quiet composed dignity and placidity
of manner, produced them one after another for the amusement of her
companion.

As they became gradually more familiar, Mysie of the Mill was just
venturing to ask, why Mary Avenel never appeared at the May-pole, and to
express her wonder when the young lady said she disliked dancing, when
a trampling of horses at the gate of the tower interrupted their
conversation.

Mysie flew to the shot-window in the full ardour of unrestrained female
curiosity. "Saint Mary! sweet lady! here come two well-mounted gallants;
will you step this way to look at them ?"

"No," said Mary Avenel, "you shall tell me who they are."

"Well, if you like it better," said Mysie--"but how shall I know
them?---Stay, I do know one of them, and so do you, lady; he is a blithe
man, somewhat light of hand, they say, but the gallants of these days
think no great harm of that. He is your uncle's henchman, that they call
Christie of the Clinthill; and he has not his old green jerkin and the
rusty blackjack over it, but a scarlet cloak, laid down with silver lace
three inches broad, and a breast-plate you might see to dress your hair
in, as well as in that keeking-glass in the ivory frame that you showed
me even now. Come, dear lady, come to the shot-window and see him."

"If it be the man you mean, Mysie," replied the orphan of Avenel, "I
shall see him soon enough, considering either the pleasure or comfort
the sight will give me."

"Nay, but if you will not come to see gay Christie," replied the Maid of
the Mill, her face flushed with eager curiosity, "come and tell me who
the gallant is that is with him, the handsomest, the very lovesomest
young man I ever saw with sight."

"It is my foster-brother, Halbert Glendinning," said Mary, with,
apparent indifference; for she had been accustomed to call the sons of
Elspeth her foster-brethren, and to live with them as if they had been
brothers in earnest.

"Nay, by Our Lady, that it is not," said Mysie; "I know the favour
of both the Glendinnings well, and I think this rider be not of our
country. He has a crimson velvet bonnet, and long brown hair falling
down under it, and a beard on his upper lip, and his chin clean and
close shaved, save a small patch on the point of the chin, and a
sky-blue jerkin slashed and lined with white satin, and trunk-hose to
suit, and no weapon but a rapier and dagger--Well, if I was a man, I
would never wear weapon but the rapier! it is so slender and becoming,
instead of having a cartload of iron at my back, like my father's
broad-sword with its great rusty basket-hilt. Do you not delight in the
rapier and poniard, lady?"

"The best sword," answered Mary, "if I must needs answer a question of
the sort, is that which is drawn in the best cause, and which is best
used when it is out of the scabbard."

"But can you not guess who this stranger should be?" said Mysie.

"Indeed, I cannot even attempt it; but to judge by his companion, it is
no matter how little he is known," replied Mary.

"My benison on his bonny face," said Mysie, "if he is not going to
alight here! Now, I am as much pleased as if my father had given me the
silver earrings he has promised me so often;--nay, you had as well come
to the window, for you must see him by and by whether you will or not."
I do not know how much sooner Mary Avenel might have sought the point
of observation, if she had not been scared from it by the unrestrained
curiosity expressed by her buxom friend; but at length the same feeling
prevailed over her sense of dignity, and satisfied with having displayed
all the indifference that was necessary in point of decorum, she no
longer thought herself bound to restrain her curiosity.

From the outshot or projecting window, she could perceive that Christie
of the Clinthill was attended on the present occasion by a very gay and
gallant cavalier, who, from the nobleness of his countenance and manner,
his rich and handsome dress, and the showy appearance of his horse and
furniture, must, she agreed with her new friend, be a person of some
consequence.

Christie also seemed conscious of something, which made him call out
with more than his usual insolence of manner, "What, ho! so ho!
the house! Churl peasants, will no one answer when I call?--Ho!
Martin,--Tibb,--Dame Glendinning--a murrain on you, must we stand
keeping our horses in the cold here, and they steaming with heat, when
we have ridden so sharply?"

At length he was obeyed, and old Martin made his appearance. "Ha!" said
Christie, "art thou there, old Truepenny? here, stable me these steeds,
and see them well bedded, and stretch thine old limbs by rubbing them
down; and see thou quit not the stable till there is not a turned hair
on either of them."

Martin took the horses to the stable as commanded, but suppressed not
his indignation a moment after he could vent it with safety. "Would not
any one think," he said to Jasper, an old ploughman, who, in coming to
his assistance, had heard Christie's imperious injunctions, "that this
loon, this Christie of the Clinthill, was laird or lord at least of him?
No such thing, man! I remember him a little dirty turnspit boy in the
house of Avenel, that every body in a frosty morning like this warmed
his fingers by kicking or cuffing! and now he is a gentleman, and
swears, d--n him and renounce him, as if the gentlemen could not so
much as keep their own wickedness to themselves, without the like of
him going to hell in their very company, and by the same road. I have as
much a mind as ever I had to my dinner, to go back and tell him to sort
his horse himself, since he is as able as I am."

"Hout tout, man!" answered Jasper, "keep a calm sough; better to fleech
a fool than fight with him."

Martin acknowledged the truth of the proverb, and, much comforted
therewith, betook himself to cleaning the stranger's horse with great
assiduity, remarking, it was a pleasure to handle a handsome nag,
and turned over the other to the charge of Jasper. Nor was it until
Christie's commands were literally complied with that he deemed it
proper, after fitting ablutions, to join the party in the spence; not
for the purpose of waiting upon them, as a mere modern reader might
possibly expect, but that he might have his share of dinner in their
company.

In the meanwhile, Christie had presented his companion to Dame
Glendinning as Sir Piercie Shafton, a friend of his and of his master,
come to spend three or four days with little din in the tower. The good
dame could not conceive how she was entitled to such an honour, and
would fain have pleaded her want of every sort of convenience to
entertain a guest of that quality. But, indeed, the visiter, when
he cast his eyes round the bare walls, eyed the huge black chimney,
scrutinized the meagre and broken furniture of the apartment, and
beheld the embarrassment of the mistress of the family, intimated great
reluctance to intrude upon Dame Glendinning a visit, which could scarce,
from all appearances, prove otherwise than an inconvenience to her, and
a penance to himself.

But the reluctant hostess and her guest had to do with an inexorable
man, who silenced all expostulations with, "such was his master's
pleasure. And, moreover," he continued, "though the Baron of Avenel's
will must, and ought to prove law to all within ten miles around him,
yet here, dame," he said, "is a letter from your petticoated baron, the
lord-priest yonder, who enjoins you, as you regard his pleasure, that
you afford to this good knight such decent accommodation as is in your
power, suffering him to live as privately as he shall desire.--And
for you, Sir Piercie Shafton," continued Christie, "you will judge for
yourself, whether secrecy and safety is not more your object even now,
than soft beds and high cheer. And do not judge of the dame's goods
by the semblance of her cottage; for you will see by the dinner she is
about to spread for us, that the vassal of the kirk is seldom found with
her basket bare." To Mary Avenel, Christie presented the stranger, after
the best fashion he could, as to the niece of his master the baron.

While he thus laboured to reconcile Sir Piercie Shafton to his fate, the
widow, having consulted her son Edward on the real import of the Lord
Abbot's injunction, and having found that Christie had given a true
exposition, saw nothing else left for her but to make that fate as easy
as she could to the stranger. He himself also seemed reconciled to his
lot by some feeling probably of strong necessity, and accepted with
a good grace the hospitality which the dame offered with a very
indifferent one.

In fact, the dinner, which soon smoked before the assembled guests,
was of that substantial kind which warrants plenty and comfort. Dame
Glendinning had cooked it after her best manner; and, delighted with the
handsome appearance which her good cheer made when placed on the table,
forgot both her plans and the vexations which interrupted them, in the
hospitable duty of pressing her assembled visiters to eat and drink,
watching every trencher as it waxed empty, and loading it with fresh
supplies ere the guest could utter a negative.

In the meanwhile, the company attentively regarded each other's motions,
and seemed endeavouring to form a judgment of each other's character.
Sir Piercie Shafton condescended to speak to no one but to Mary Avenel,
and on her he conferred exactly the same familiar and compassionate,
though somewhat scornful sort of attention, which a pretty fellow of
these days will sometimes condescend to bestow on a country miss, when
there is no prettier or more fashionable woman present. The manner
indeed was different, for the etiquette of those times did not permit
Sir Piercie Shafton to pick his teeth, or to yawn, or to gabble like the
beggar whose tongue (as he says) was cut out by the Turks, or to affect
deafness or blindness, or any other infirmity of the organs. But though
the embroidery of his conversation was different, the groundwork was the
same, and the high-flown and ornate compliments with which the gallant
knight of the sixteenth century inter-larded his conversation, were as
much the offspring of egotism and self-conceit, as the jargon of the
coxcombs of our own days.

The English knight was, however, something daunted at finding that Mary
Avenel listened with an air of indifference, and answered with wonderful
brevity, to all the fine things which ought, as he conceived, to have
dazzled her with their brilliancy, and puzzled her by their obscurity.
But if he was disappointed in making the desired, or rather the expected
impression, upon her whom he addressed, Sir Piercie Shafton's discourse
was marvellous in the ears of Mysie the Miller's daughter, and not the
less so that she did not comprehend the meaning of a single word which
he uttered. Indeed, the gallant knight's language was far too courtly to
be understood by persons of much greater acuteness than Mysie's.

It was about this period, that the "only rare poet of his time, the
witty, comical, facetiously-quick, and quickly-facetious, John Lylly--he
that sate at Apollo's table, and to whom Phoebus gave a wreath of his
own bays without snatching" [Footnote: Such, and yet more extravagant,
are the compliments paid to this author by his editor, Blount.
Notwithstanding all exaggeration, Lylly was really a man of wit and
imagination, though both were deformed by the most unnatural affectation
that ever disgraced a printed page.]--he, in short, who wrote that
singularly coxcomical work, called _Euphues and his England_, was in the
very zenith of his absurdity and his reputation. The quaint, forced,
and unnatural style which he introduced by his "Anatomy of Wit," had
a fashion as rapid as it was momentary--all the court ladies were his
scholars, and to _parler Euphuisme_, was as necessary a qualification to
a courtly gallant, as those of understanding how to use his rapier, or
to dance a measure.

It was no wonder that the Maid of the Mill was soon as effectually
blinded by the intricacies of this erudite and courtly style of
conversation, as she had ever been by the dust of her father's own
meal-sacks. But there she sate with her mouth and eyes as open as the
mill-door and the two windows, showing teeth as white as her father's
bolted flour, and endeavouring to secure a word or two for her own
future use out of the pearls of rhetoric which Sir Piercie Shafton
scattered around him with such bounteous profusion.

For the male part of the company, Edward felt ashamed of his own manner
and slowness of speech, when he observed the handsome young courtier,
with an ease and volubility of which he had no conception, run over
all the commonplace topics of high-flown gallantry. It is true the good
sense and natural taste of young Glendinning soon informed him that the
gallant cavalier was speaking nonsense. But, alas! where is the man of
modest merit, and real talent, who has not suffered from being outshone
in conversation and outstripped in the race of life, by men of less
reserve, and of qualities more showy, though less substantial? and well
constituted must the mind be, that can yield up the prize without envy
to competitors more worthy than himself.

Edward Glendinning had no such philosophy. While he despised the jargon
of the gay cavalier, he envied the facility with which he could run on,
as well as the courtly tone and expression, and the perfect ease and
elegance with which he offered all the little acts of politeness to
which the duties of the table gave opportunity. And if I am to speak
truth, I must own that he envied those qualities the more as they
were all exercised in Mary Avenel's service, and, although only so
far accepted as they could not be refused, intimated a wish on the
stranger's part to place himself in her good graces, as the only person
in the room to whom he thought it worth while to recommend himself. His
title, rank, and very handsome figure, together with some sparks of wit
and spirit which flashed across the cloud of nonsense which he uttered,
rendered him, as the words of the old song say, "a lad for a lady's
viewing;" so that poor Edward, with all his real worth and acquired
knowledge, in his home-spun doublet, blue cap, and deerskin trowsers,
looked like a clown beside the courtier, and, feeling the full
inferiority, nourished no good-will to him by whom he was eclipsed.

Christie, on the other hand, as soon as he had satisfied to the full a
commodious appetite, by means of which persons of his profession could,
like the wolf and eagle, gorge themselves with as much food at one meal
as might serve them for several days, began also to feel himself more in
the back-ground than he liked to be. This worthy had, amongst his other
good qualities, an excellent opinion of himself; and, being of a bold
and forward disposition, had no mind to be thrown into the shade by
any one. With an impudent familiarity which such persons mistake for
graceful ease, he broke in upon the knight's finest speeches with as
little remorse as he would have driven the point of his lance through a
laced doublet. Sir Piercie Shafton, a man of rank and high birth, by no
means encouraged or endured this familiarity, and requited the intruder
either with total neglect, or such laconic replies as intimated a
sovereign contempt for the rude spearman, who affected to converse with
him upon terms of equality.

The Miller held his peace; for, as his usual conversation turned chiefly
on his clapper and toll-dish, he had no mind to brag of his wealth in
presence of Christie of the Clinthill, or to intrude his discourse on
the English cavalier.

A little specimen of the conversation may not be out of place, were it
but to show young ladies what fine things they have lost by living when
Euphuism is out of fashion.

"Credit me, fairest lady," said the knight, "that such is the cunning
of our English courtiers, of the hodiernal strain, that, as they
have infinitely refined upon the plain and rusticial discourse of
our fathers, which, as I may say, more beseemed the mouths of country
roisterers in a May-game than that of courtly gallants in a galliard,
so I hold it ineffably and unutterably impossible, that those who may
succeed us in that garden of wit and courtesy shall alter or amend it.
Venus delighted but in the language of Mercury, Bucephalus will stoop to
no one but Alexander, none can sound Apollo's pipe but Orpheus."

"Valiant sir," said Mary, who could scarcely help laughing, "we have
but to rejoice in the chance which hath honoured this solitude with a
glimpse of the sun of courtesy, though it rather blinds than enlightens
us."

"Pretty and quaint, fairest lady," answered the Euphuist. "Ah, that I
had with me my Anatomy of Wit--that all-to-be-unparalleled volume--that
quintessence of human wit--that treasury of quaint
invention--that exquisitively-pleasant-to-read, and
inevitably-necessary-to-be-remembered manual, of all that is worthy
to be known--which indoctrines the rude in civility, the dull in
intellectuality, the heavy in jocosity, the blunt in gentility, the
vulgar in nobility, and all of them in that unutterable perfection, of
human utterance, that eloquence which no other eloquence is sufficient
to praise, that art which, when we call it by its own name of Euphuism,
we bestow on it its richest panegyric."

"By Saint Mary," said Christie of the Clinthill, "if your worship
had told me that you had left such stores of wealth as you talk of at
Prudhoe Castle, Long Dickie and I would have had them off with us if man
and horse could have carried them; but you told us of no treasure I wot
of, save the silver tongs for turning up your mustachoes."

The knight treated this intruder's mistake--for certainly Christie had
no idea that all these epithets which sounded so rich and splendid,
were lavished upon a small quarto volume--with a stare, and then turning
again to Mary Avenel, the only person whom he thought worthy to address,
he proceeded in his strain of high-flown oratory, "Even thus," said he,
"do hogs contemn the splendour of Oriental pearls; even thus are the
delicacies of a choice repast in vain offered to the long-eared grazer
of the common, who turneth from them to devour a thistle. Surely as
idle is it to pour forth the treasures of oratory before the eyes of the
ignorant, and to spread the dainties of the intellectual banquet before
those who are, morally and metaphysically speaking, no better than
asses."

"Sir Knight, since that is your quality," said Edward, "we cannot strive
with you in loftiness of language; but I pray you in fair courtesy,
while you honour my father's house with your presence, to spare us such
vile comparisons."

"Peace, good villagio," said the knight, gracefully waving his hand, "I
prithee peace, kind rustic; and you, my guide, whom I may scarce call
honest, let me prevail upon you to imitate the laudable taciturnity of
that honest yeoman, who sits as mute as a mill-post, and of that
comely damsel, who seems as with her ears she drank in what she did not
altogether comprehend, even as a palfrey listening to a lute, whereof,
howsoever, he knoweth not the gamut."

"Marvellous fine words," at length said Dame Glendinning, who began to
be tired of sitting so long silent, "marvellous fine words, neighbour
Happer, are they not?"

"Brave words--very brave words--very exceeding pyet words," answered the
Miller; "nevertheless, to speak my mind, a lippy of bran were worth a
bushel of them."

"I think so too, under his worship's favour," answered Christie of the
Clinthill. "I well remember that at the race of Morham, as we call
it, near Berwick, I took a young Southern fellow out of saddle with my
lance, and cast him, it might be, a gad's length from his nag; and so,
as he had some gold on his laced doublet, I deemed he might ha' the like
on it in his pocket too, though that is a rule that does not aye hold
good--So I was speaking to him of ransom, and out he comes with a
handful of such terms as his honour there hath gleaned up, and craved me
for mercy, as I was a true son of Mars, and such like."

"And obtained no mercy at thy hand, I dare be sworn," said the knight,
who deigned not to speak Euphuism excepting to the fair sex.

"By my troggs," replied Christie, "I would have thrust my lance down his
throat, but just then they flung open that accursed postern-gate, and
forth pricked old Hunsdon, and Henry Carey, and as many fellows at their
heels as turned the chase northward again. So I e'en pricked Bayard with
the spur, and went off with the rest; for a man should ride when he may
not wrestle, as they say in Tynedale."

"Trust me," said the knight, again turning to Mary Avenel, "if I do
not pity you, lady, who, being of noble blood, are thus in a manner
compelled to abide in the cottage of the ignorant, like the precious
stone in the head of the toad, or like a precious garland on the brow of
an ass.--But soft, what gallant have we here, whose garb savoureth more
of the rustic than doth his demeanour, and whose looks seem more lofty
than his habit; even as--"

"I pray you, Sir Knight," said Mary, "to spare your courtly similitudes
for refined ears, and give me leave to name unto you my foster-brother,
Halbert Glendinning."

"The son of the good dame of the cottage, as I opine," answered the
English knight; "for by some such name did my guide discriminate
the mistress of this mansion, which you, madam, enrich with your
presence.--And yet, touching this juvenal, he hath that about him which
belongeth to higher birth, for all are not black who dig coals--"

"Nor all white who are millers," said honest Happer, glad to get in a
word, as they say, edgeways.

Halbert, who had sustained the glance of the Englishman with some
impatience, and knew not what to make of his manner and language,
replied with some asperity, "Sir Knight, we have in this land of
Scotland an ancient saying, 'Scorn not the bush that bields you'--you
are a guest of my father's house to shelter you from danger, if I am
rightly informed by the domestics. Scoff not its homeliness, nor that of
its inmates--ye might long have abidden at the court of England, ere
we had sought your favour, or cumbered you with our society. Since your
fate has sent you hither amongst us, be contented with such fare and
such converse as we can afford you, and scorn us not for our kindness;
for the Scots wear short patience and long daggers."

All eyes were turned on Halbert while he was thus speaking, and
there was a general feeling that his countenance had an expression of
intelligence, and his person an air of dignity, which they had never
before observed. Whether it were that the wonderful Being with whom
he had so lately held communication, had bestowed on him a grace and
dignity of look and bearing which he had not before, or whether the
being conversant in high matters, and called to a destiny beyond that
of other men, had a natural effect in giving becoming confidence to his
language and manner, we pretend not to determine. But it was evident
to all, that, from this day, young Halbert was an altered man; that
he acted with the steadiness, promptitude, and determination,
which belonged to riper years, and bore himself with a manner which
appertained to higher rank.

The knight took the rebuke with good humour. "By my mine honour," he
said, "thou hast reason on thy side, good juvenal--nevertheless, I spoke
not as in ridicule of the roof which relieves me, but rather in your own
praise, to whom, if this roof be native, thou mayst nevertheless rise
from its lowliness; even as the lark, which maketh its humble nest
in the furrow, ascendeth towards the sun, as well as the eagle which
buildeth her eyry in the cliff."

This high-flown discourse was interrupted by Dame Glendinning, who, with
all the busy anxiety of a mother, was loading her son's trencher with
food, and dinning in his ear her reproaches on account of his prolonged
absence. "And see," she said, "that you do not one day get such a sight
while you are walking about among the haunts of them that are not of our
flesh and bone, as befell Mungo Murray when he slept on the greensward
ring of the Auld Kirkhill at sunset, and wakened at daybreak in the wild
hills of Breadalbane. And see that, when you are looking for deer, the
red stag does not gall you as he did Diccon Thorburn, who never
overcast the wound that he took from a buck's horn. And see, when you go
swaggering about with a long broadsword by your side, whilk it
becomes no peaceful man to do, that you dinna meet with them that have
broadsword and lance both--there are enow of rank riders in this land,
that neither fear God nor regard man."

Here her eye "in a fine frenzy rolling," fell full upon that of Christie
of the Clinthill, and at once her fears for having given offence
interrupted the current of maternal rebuke, which, like rebuke
matrimonial, may be often better meant than timed. There was something
of sly and watchful significance in Christie's eye, an eye gray, keen,
fierce, yet wily, formed to express at once cunning, and malice, which
made the dame instantly conjecture she had said too much, while she
saw in imagination her twelve goodly cows go lowing down the glen in a
moonlight night, with half a score of Border spearsmen at their heels.

Her voice, therefore, sunk from the elevated tone of maternal authority
into a whimpering apologetic sort of strain, and she proceeded to say,
"It is no that I have ony ill thoughts of the Border riders, for Tibb
Tacket there has often heard me say that I thought spear and bridle as
natural to a Borderman as a pen to a priest, or a feather-fan to a lady;
and--have you not heard me say it, Tibb?"

Tibb showed something less than her expected alacrity in attesting her
mistress's deep respect for the freebooters of the southland hills; but,
thus conjured, did at length reply, "Hout ay, mistress, I'se warrant I
have heard you say something like that."

"Mother!" said Halbert, in a firm and commanding tone of voice, "what
or whom is it that you fear under my father's roof?--I well hope that
it harbours not a guest in whose presence you are afraid to say your
pleasure to me or my brother? I am sorry I have been detained so late,
being ignorant of the fair company which I should encounter on my
return.--I pray you let this excuse suffice: and what satisfies you,
will, I trust, be nothing less than acceptable to your guests."

An answer calculated so jistly betwixt the submission due to his parent,
and the natural feeling of dignity in one who was by birth master of
the mansion, excited universal satisfaction. And as Elspeth herself
confessed to Tibb on the same evening, "She did not think it had been in
the callant. Till that night, he took pets and passions if he was spoke
to, and lap through the house like a four-year-auld at the least word of
advice that was minted at him, but now he spoke as grave and as douce as
the Lord Abbot himself. She kendna," she said, "what might be the upshot
of it, but it was like he was a wonderfu' callant even now."

The party then separated, the young men retiring to their apartments,
the elder to their household cares. While Christie went to see his horse
properly accommodated, Edward betook himself to his book, and Halbert,
who was as ingenious in employing his hands as he had hitherto appeared
imperfect in mental exertion, applied himself to constructing a place
of concealment in the floor of his apartment by raising a plank, beneath
which he resolved to deposit that copy of the Holy Scriptures which had
been so strangely regained from the possession of men and spirits.

In the meanwhile Sir Piercie Shafton sate still as a stone, in the chair
in which he had deposited himself, his hands folded on his breast, his
legs stretched straight out before him and resting upon the heels, his
eyes cast up to the ceiling as if he had meant to count every mesh of
every cobweb with which the arched roof was canopied, wearing at the
same time a face of as solemn and imperturbable gravity, as if his
existence had depended on the accuracy of his calculation.

He could scarce be roused from his listless state of contemplative
absorption so as to take some supper, a meal at which the younger
females appeared not. Sir Piercie stared around twice or thrice as if he
missed something; but he asked not for them, and only evinced his sense
of a proper audience being wanting, by his abstraction and absence of
mind, seldom speaking until he was twice addressed, and then replying,
without trope or figure, in that plain English which nobody could speak
better when he had a mind.

Christie, finding himself in undisturbed possession of the conversation,
indulged all who chose to listen with details of his own wild and
inglorious warfare, while Dame Elspeth's curch bristled with horror,
and Tibb Tacket, rejoiced to find herself once more in the company of
a jackman, listened to his tales, like Desdemona to Othello's, with
undisguised delight. Meantime the two young Glendinnings were each
wrapped up in his own reflections, and only interrupted in them by the
signal to move bedward.

In the morning Christie of the Clinthill was nowhere to be seen. As this
worthy personage did seldom pique himself on sounding a trumpet before
his movements, no one was surprised at his moonlight departure, though
some alarm was excited lest he had not made it empty-handed. So, in the
language of the national ballad,

  Some ran to cupboard, and some to kist,
  But nought was away that could be mist.

All was in order, the key of the stable left above the door, and that of
