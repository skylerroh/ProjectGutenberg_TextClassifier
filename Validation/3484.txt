"Unfortunately, we cannot repeat Tornado Six.
When I approved it, I intended it as a one-time
operation to, shall we say, test the waters.
It succeeded through your command, and the
extraordinary initiative of Brad Curtin. We
must now go on to other probing and design new
confrontations from which the UIPS will be forced
to retreat. Our tactics will, at times, include
diversions, as we must keep both INOR governments
and the UIPS off-balance. They must be kept
guessing -- not certain -- where I will move next."

"How do you expect them to react to such
provocation?"

"There is little likelihood the UIPS will gamble
with the future of our solar civilization by
retreating from Slingshot; they cannot risk the
system-wide demoralization and desolation that
would follow. I intend to play on their fears and
on public pressures to attain my ends. That's where
threats come in; we must use them regularly, but
with cunning and consistency. UIPS perception of
danger to Slingshot, compounded by the enormous
distances from their military centers, will
compel them to be reasonable. If our tactics
are convincing the UIPS will have no alternatives.
They will accede to my demands."

"What if they resist?"

Narval's pudgy fists resumed their cadenced
pounding.

"Let them," he snarled, "I will be ready; I will go
further and challenge them. They will be compelled
to come to me, and I command the high ground.
I will defeat them, and move on quickly to my
ultimate objective."

"And what is that?"

"Isn't it obvious?"

"Yes, President Narval, but I must be certain."
Drummer's face was pale. "My ears want to hear
what my mind has been forced to conclude."

"Very well, Drummer, hear this. Planet Pluto
is strategically situated at this time to be the
single, most influential force in human affairs. I
will use that influence to consolidate my military
control over INOR. When I have that I will confront
the UIPS and beat them down. I, Narval, will
dominate the Solar System."

Narval's ultimate objective was clear and set.
Drummer knew better than to dissuade him.

Having confided in Drummer, Narval waxed garrulous.

"I have debts to pay," he said, "and I shall get
much pleasure in making good on them. Many insults
and humiliations need to be returned to former
colleagues on Callisto. And there are others,
in tank towns throughout the Outer Region and
in the UIPS. They will feel my wrath."

"Is vengeance all there is to it?"

Narval caught himself.

"No, no, of course not," he said, hurriedly. "I
shall govern. I shall be wise and magnanimous.
Magnanimous, that is, to those who support
me, and," clenching his fists again, "merciless to
those who oppose me or seek to undermine my will."

"Considering Planet Pluto's distance from the
centers of social and industrial activity," Drummer
interjected, "and our planet's far-ranging orbit,
this could be a difficult location from which to
govern the Solar System."

"I've thought of that, Drummer. I shall move to
Luna and rule from there. In stages, we can adjust
to its gravity. Once Slingshot goes operational,
this planet will revert to an outpost, for most of
its orbit beyond the solar rim. It was never meant
to be more. To me, Planet Pluto has always been
just another stepping stone."

A broad grin rippled across Narval's features.
Drummer, somber-faced, returned Narval's gaze
and saw his eyes shrink into lumpy flesh.

"Drummer, my plans include a position of great
power and prestige for you."

"Indeed?"

"A new elite and a new hierarchy will be created
when I take control. I will want a council of
advisors, commanders and administrators for
internal affairs, constabulary and military forces,
security, intelligence, and a vast bureaucracy to
manage the affairs of government for an entire
system of planets, satellites, and thousands of
artificial colonies. Much will need to be done, and
you will be in the forefront."

"You honor me."

"I expect faithful service, Drummer."

"I shall do my best."

"Good. Now, as to Brad Curtin."

Narval leaned back and entwined his fingers
across his abdomen.

"I had him here a short time ago and questioned
him under a psychic probe. He withstood the inquiry.
The probe did not disclose any inconsistencies to
my questions; therefore, I can only conclude he is
what he claims to be. What is your opinion?"

"My talks with Brad and his companions led me
to that conclusion."

"So be it then."

Narval's attention seemed to wander. He reached
for a document on the desk, and he perused it as
if his mind was elsewhere.

"Drummer," he said, raising his eyes, "I want you
to give Brad a special assignment, and report to
me periodically how it is progressing. Keep Brad's
group together, but watch them, and report to me
immediately of any suspicious activities. I've also
ordered Scarf to keep an eye on Brad and his crew."

"Scarf? To what purpose?"

"I have plans for Brad, if he does well."

"What is the task?"

Narval locked eyes with Drummer.

"Tell Brad to prepare plans and evaluate our
military capabilities to penetrate the protective
shield around the Logistics Depot, to capture it
and use it as hostage."

"Good God! Take the depot as hostage? For what
purpose?"

"The reason you will give Brad is that INOR will
hold it hostage for a greater share in decisions on
the disposition of Slingshot-generated assets."

"That isn't the real reason, is it?"

"No. The objective is diversionary."

"And the real objective?"

"You will be told when it is time."





 Chapter TWENTY-THREE


The Sentinels slouched in chairs, or sat on
the floor, backs against the walls of the small
workroom. Their faces reflected fatigue.

"About fleet capabilities for sustained combat,"
Brad said. "I need a 'how goes it' on the status of
your evaluations. Give me a quick rundown and a
documented report by the end of the day. Myra,
you first."

Myra spoke from where she sat on a chair tilted
against the wall.

"I had training facilities and systems, emergency
medical support, and general administrative backup.
What I saw was guys and gals floundering around,
leaning on each other, and making excuses. The
training programs are antiquated; many aren't even
remotely tied in with the equipment installed on
ships of the line. Equipment operators are learning
by hit-or-miss, and they miss much too often.
Can't blame them for low effectiveness because
the procedures are hazardous to their health. If
we don't improve the situation fast, the crews will
deteriorate to where they won't be worth a damn
when the going gets even a mite rough."

Myra paused, tipped her chair forward, crossed
her arms, and gave Brad a hard look.

"I mean it, Brad. What's more, the medical backup
for combat support is atrocious. If we incur
casualties, the injured won't have much to
depend on, and if the troops have no faith in their
medics, their morale will drop, and I mean fast.
There goes your combat capability. For example,
medical supplies haven't been checked and updated
for years, if they were ever checked at all. They
don't know what they've got or where.

"The system needs a complete overhaul. I
spot-checked the software and links on training,
medical, and administrative systems, and found them
to be full of gaps and obsolete links and citations.
My report, Brad, is that these areas need one hell
of a lot of work to get them up to even minimum
standards."

Myra tipped her chair back until her head and
shoulders touched the wall and she closed her
eyes. Her exhaustion was unmistakable.

"Document your findings, Myra," Brad said. "I
want specific recommendations to deal with each
deficiency that you find, the name of the person
accountable, and a list of the supplies, equipment
and skills to clear the problem."

Turning to the others, he added, "That goes for
everyone; there isn't much to work with, so be
realistic. If you report a problem, tell me how to
fix it. If the shortages can't be filled, we might
have to take from one ship or facility to fix
others. Clear?"

Silence.

"OK, you're next, Zolan. What's the story on
communications?"

"The equipment is generally good. It all came
from the Inner Region, and not very long ago. Part
of what we have was taken in the raids on UIPS
ships; the rest is original equipment installed
here during the Slingshot build-up. Most of the
space-to-space systems are fully operational; there
are some weaknesses in space-to-surface links."

"That part can be handled."

Zolan paused to nod at Myra.

"There's a 'but', though, and here's where I tie in
with Myra's findings on training. We've got a good
supply of comm spares, but not enough skills to do
the work. The comm folks can operate the equipment,
no sweat there. The problem is that although
much of the gear is self-repairing through built-in
robotics, when the robies themselves need fixing,
no one knows how. Chain reaction; it won't take
long for subsystems to break down as the pressure
of sustained ops builds. Barely enough maintenance
robots on each ship and station to keep the
equipment working. The number of out-of-commission
robots is increasing steadily, and no one seems
to know what to do about it. In time, this could
easily lead to wide gaps in communications
capabilities."

"Do you know what to do about it?" Brad asked.

"Yes."

"Lay it out in your report. That's one area where
we can't afford any screw-ups. Adari, let's hear it
on ship's navigation systems and surface nav-aids."

"Well, Brad," Adari grinned, "I had a nice summary
all arranged in my mind, but I won't waste time
by repeating what Zolan and Myra reported. Comm
maintenance also applies to nav, as does training
and data. The equipment is good, but only because
it's fairly new and is robotically self-maintained.
But nav robotics have no backups. Generally, when
maintenance robies need fixing the work's done
by human specialists or other specialized robies.
They're not on board. Eventually, this fleet is
going to be in a sad predicament: nav equipment
will go down with no way to get 'em back on line."

"How are you on fixing nav robots, Adari," Brad
smiled.

"I get by."

"Put that in your report, too." Brad turned to
Kumiko and nodded.

"Guns, power packs, tracking and fire-control
systems in fair shape. Ordnance controllers and
gunners are a breed apart, especially when they're
taking care of their own, and even when working
conditions are tight. They normally do most of
their own maintenance. The guns are modern, and
there's a good supply of ready-to-install chargers.
Ship commanders exercise their gun crews frequently,
and many have been on the raids, so they have ops
experience that the UIPS Space Force lacks. As
far as armaments go, this fleet will be a powerful
adversary in any confrontation."

"Sounds encouraging," Brad said wryly. "When
you prepare your report, just tell it like it is. A bit
of good news would be welcome." Motioning to Hodak,
he added with a tight grin, "Last, but not least,
what's the situation on structures, facilities,
energy sources, and general logistical support."

Hodak, leaning against the wall, rubbed his bald
spot and frowned.

"I ain't happy at all," he said. "As I told you on
the Dragon, maintenance training of ships' crews
is sloppy, and standards are either just not there
or obsolete. We're working on the ops and logistical
support checklists but they're still far from
compatible with facilities and installed systems.
These guys operate by the seat-of-their-pants.
What's more, ship's structural and power plant
robies are down for maintenance half the time
and spare parts are a mess. That also applies
to surface shops and equipment.

"When ships are taken out of the line for repair,
the process is too damn long, mostly because of
the marginal and nonstandard support equipment.
We got a real problem here, Brad. The sooner we
get on it the better."

Brad leveled a finger at Hodak.

"I want you to include in your report a way to
update direct support from surface shops. If we're
going to do ourselves any good on this rim rock
one thing we can't afford is a fleet that can't stand
up to a confrontation with the Inner Region. I'm not
about to be hauled back to that tin can Guardian
Station to face escape charges. I don't think any
of us want that."

Adari and Hodak nodded; the rest sat motionless.
All looked somber.

Brad stood. "That's all for now. I'm going to give
an oral report to Narval as soon as I can arrange
to see him. He needs to issue a heads up with a
whip in his hands. Meanwhile, you all have jobs to
do. Be where I can reach you."

 ##

Narval and Drummer turned away from the view tank
in which they had observed Brad and heard his words
and those of his cohorts.

"Well, what do you think?" Narval bit into a
fingernail.

"They raise valid issues, President Narval. If we
are to challenge the UIPS military we certainly
can't do it with an inferior force. I think we
should listen carefully to what Brad suggests,
and then, considering your objectives, adopt those
ideas that will assist you in attaining them."

"I will listen to Brad, Drummer," Narval said.
"Then, I will tell him to report the details of his
findings to you. I want you both to do what's
necessary to bring our military fleet to a high
level of readiness. Prepare instructions to our
commanders for my signature. We must reach
our maximum combat capability in the shortest
possible time."

Narval's eyes gleamed beady-bright.

"The shortest possible time. Did you hear me,
Drummer?"

"Yes, Mr. President, I heard you."

"I want to be informed, within the next one hundred
hours, when you and Brad expect the fleet will
be ready for sustained operations, and I mean
'combat readiness'. The names of ship and facility
commanders who do not cooperate with you or
Brad will be reported to me immediately. Do you
understand?"

"I do."

"Very well. Now, I have a special assignment for
Brad. As soon as the two of you have the fleet
upgrading program under way, I want Brad to conduct
a joint review with INOR military commanders to
find out what shape they're in for a confrontation
with the UIPS, should it come to that. I've already
communicated with the heads of Outer Region
governments, and they've agreed in principle to
a preliminary meeting. I've approved a meeting
place off Neptune; Scarf has the schedule and the
coordinates. He will accompany Brad as my Security
representative and sit in on all discussions. Tell
Brad to use the Dragon for the mission and to chair
the meeting. Let the INOR people tour our ship; we
must give the impression of power. Any questions?"

"Brad may need to reveal what he knows of plans
to take the Depot."

"I want him to do just that early on in the
meeting. It will give them all a target against
which to plan and integrate deployment schedules,
vectors, tactics and combined operations.
Anything else?"

"No, President Narval."





 Chapter TWENTY-FOUR


Brad stood beside Captain Crisper and surveyed
the scene in the tank on the Dragon's bridge. Scarf
lounged in an accello-net within sight and sound,
as he had for most of the voyage from Pluto.

The Dragon's pilot and communicator, upper bodies
insulated in instrumented cubicles, concentrated
on their tasks. Arms folded across his chest, Zolan
stood along a bulkhead where his eyes could take
in the full compartment without altering stance.

Ahead lay Triton in its retrograde orbit around
