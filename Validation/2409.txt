 _Herbert was truly a gentleman
  robot. The ladies' slightest
    wish was his command...._

     BY CHARLES L. FONTENAY


Herbert bowed with a muted clank--indicating he probably needed oiling
somewhere--and presented Alice with a perfect martini on a silver tray.
He stood holding the tray, a white, permanent porcelain smile on his
smooth metal face, as Alice sipped the drink and grimaced.

"It's a good martini, Herbert," said Alice. "Thank you. But, dammit, I
wish you didn't have that everlasting smile!"
