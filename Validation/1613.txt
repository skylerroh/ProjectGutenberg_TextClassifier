feathers till the storm has passed. Into His haven of
Soul there enters no element of earth to cast out angels,
to silence the right intuition which guides you safely
home.

Exercise more faith in God and His spiritual means [30]

[Page 153.]

and methods, than in man and his material ways and [1]
means, of establishing the Cause of Christian Science.
If right yourself, God will confirm His inheritance. "Be
not weary in well doing." Truth is restful, and Love is
triumphant. [5]

When God went forth before His people, they were
fed with manna: they marched through the wilderness:
they passed through the Red Sea, untouched by the bil-
lows. At His command, the rock became a fountain;
and the land of promise, green isles of refreshment. In [10]
the words of the Psalmist, when "the Lord gave the word:
great was the company of those that published it."

God is good to Israel,--washed in the waters of
Meribah, cleansed of the flesh,--good to His Israel
encompassed not with pride, hatred, self-will, and self- [15]
justification; wherein violence covereth men as a gar-
ment, and as captives are they enchained.

Christian Scientists bring forth the fruits of Spirit,
not flesh; and God giveth this "new name" to no man
who honors Him not by positive proof of trustworthiness. [20]
May you be able to say, "I have not cleansed my heart
in vain."

Sir Edwin Arnold, to whom I presented a copy of
my first edition of "Science and Health with Key to the
Scriptures," writes:-- [25]


    Peace on earth and Good-will!
    Souls that are gentle and still
    Hear the first music of this
    Far-off, infinite, Bliss!


So may the God of peace be and abide with this church. [30]

Affectionately yours,

To First Church Of Christ, Scientist, In Lawrence


_Beloved Brethren_:--The spreading branches of The
Church of Christ, Scientist, are fast reaching out their
broad shelter to the entire world. Your faith has not [5]
been without works,--and God's love for His flock is
manifest in His care. He will dig about this little church,
prune its encumbering branches, water it with the dews
of heaven, enrich its roots, and enlarge its borders with
divine Love. God only waits for man's worthiness to [10]
enhance the means and measure of His grace. You
have already proof of the prosperity of His Zion. You
sit beneath your own vine and fig-tree as the growth
of spirituality--even that vine whereof our Father is
husbandman. [15]

It is the purpose of divine Love to resurrect the under-
standing, and the kingdom of God, the reign of har-
mony already within us. Through the word that is
spoken unto you, are you made free. Abide in His word,
and it shall abide in you; and the healing Christ will [20]
again be made manifest in the flesh--understood and
glorified.

Honor thy Father and Mother, God. Continue in
His love. Bring forth fruit--"signs following"--that
your prayers be not hindered. Pray without ceasing. [25]
Watch diligently; never desert the post of spiritual ob-
servation and self-examination. Strive for self-abnega-
tion, justice, meekness, mercy, purity, love. Let your
light reflect Light. Have no ambition, affection, nor
aim apart from holiness. Forget not for a moment, that [30]

[Page 155.]

God is All-in-all--therefore, that in reality there is but [1]
one cause and effect.

The pride of circumstance or power is the prince of
this world that has nothing in Christ. All power and
happiness are spiritual, and proceed from goodness. [5]
Sacrifice self to bless one another, even as God has
blessed you. Forget self in laboring for mankind; then
will you woo the weary wanderer to your door, win the
pilgrim and stranger to your church, and find access to
the heart of humanity. While pressing meekly on, be [10]
faithful, be valiant in the Christian's warfare, and peace
will crown your joy.

Lovingly yours,
MARY BAKER EDDY




To Correspondents


_Beloved Students_:--Because Mother has not the time
even to read all of her interesting correspondence, and
less wherein to answer it (however much she desires
thus to do), she hereby requests: First, that you, her
students' students, who write such excellent letters to [20]
her, will hereafter, as a general rule, send them to the
editors of _The Christian Science Journal_ for publication,
and thereby give to us all the pleasure of hearing from you.

If my own students cannot spare time to write to God,
--when they address me I shall be apt to forward their [25]
letters to Him as our common Parent, and by way of
_The Christian Science Journal_; thus fulfilling their moral
obligation to furnish some reading-matter for our denomi-
national organ. Methinks, were they to contemplate the
universal charge wherewith divine Love has entrusted us, [30]

[Page 156.]

in behalf of a suffering race, they would contribute oftener [1]
to the pages of this swift vehicle of scientific thought;
for it reaches a vast number of earnest readers, and seek-
ers after Truth.

With love,
MARY BAKER EDDY




To Students


_Beloved Christian Scientists_:--Please send in your
contributions as usual to our _Journal_. All is well at head-
quarters, and when the mist shall melt away you will see
clearly the signs of Truth and the heaven of Love within [10]
your hearts. Let the reign of peace and harmony be
supreme and forever yours.

I proposed to merge the adjourned meeting in the one
held at Chicago, because I saw no advantage, but great
disadvantage, in one student's opinions or _modus oper-_ [15]
_andi_ becoming the basis for others: read "Retrospection"
on this subject. Science is absolute, and best under-
stood through the study of my works and the daily Chris-
tian demonstration thereof. It is their _materiality_ that
clogs the progress of students, and "this kind goeth not [20]
forth but by prayer and fasting." It is materialism through
which the animal magnetizer preys, and in turn becomes
a prey. Spirituality is the basis of all true thought and
volition. Assembling themselves together, and listening
to each other amicably, or contentiously, is no aid to [25]
students in acquiring solid Christian Science. Experi-
ence and, above all, _obedience_, are the aids and tests of
growth and understanding in this direction.

With love,
MARY B. G. EDDY [30]

[Page 157.]




To A Student


_My Dear Student_:--It is a great thing to be found
worthy to suffer for Christ, Truth. Paul said, "If we
suffer, we shall also reign with him." Reign then, my
beloved in the Lord. He that marketh the sparrow's fall [5]
will direct thy way.

I have written, or caused my secretary to write, to Mr.
and Mrs. Stewart, of Toronto, Canada (you will find their
card in _The C. S. Journal_,) that you or your lawyer will
ask them all questions important for your case, and re- [10]
quested that they furnish all information possible. They
will be glad to help you. Every true Christian Scientist
will feel "as bound with you," but as free in Truth and
Love, safe under the shadow of His wing.

Yes, my student, my Father is your Father; and He [15]
helps us most when help is most needed, for He is the
ever-present help.

I am glad that you are in good cheer. I enclose you
the name of Mr. E. A. Kimball, C. S. D., of Chicago,--
5020 Woodlawn Ave.,--for items relative to Mrs. Steb- [20]
bin's case.

"Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in Him;
and He shall bring it to pass. And He shall bring forth
thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the
noonday." This I know, for God is for us. [25]

Write me when you need me. Error has no power
but to destroy itself. It _cannot harm you_; it cannot stop
the eternal currents of Truth.

Ever with love,
MARY B. G. EDDY

[Page 158.]




To A Student


_My Beloved Student:_--In reply to your letter I will
say: God's ways are not as our ways; but higher far
than the heavens above the earth is His wisdom above
ours. When I requested you to be ordained, I little [5]
thought of the changes about to be made. When I insisted
on your speaking without notes, I little knew that
so soon another change in your pulpit would be demanded.
But now, after His messenger has obeyed the message
of divine Love, comes the interpretation thereof. But you [10]
see we both had first to obey, and to do this through faith,
not sight.

The meaning of it all, as now shown, is this: when
you were bidden to be ordained, it was in reward for your
faithful service, thus to honor it. The second command, [15]
to drop the use of notes, was to rebuke a lack of faith in
divine help, and to test your humility and obedience in
bearing this cross.

All God's servants are minute men and women. As
of old, I stand with sandals on and staff in hand, wait- [20]
ing for the watchword and the revelation of what, how,
whither. Let us be faithful and obedient, and God will
do the rest.

In the April number of _The Christian Science Journal_
you will find the forthcoming completion (as I now think) [25]
of the divine directions sent out to the churches. It is
satisfactory to note, however, that the order therein given
corresponds to the example of our Master. Jesus was
not ordained as our churches ordain ministers. We
have no record that he used notes when preaching. He

[Page 159.]

spake in their synagogues, reading the Scriptures and [1]
expounding them; and God has given to this age "Science
and Health with Key to the Scriptures," to elucidate
His Word.

You may read this letter to your church, and then [5]
send it to Rev. Mr. Norcross, and he will understand.
May the God of all grace give you peace.

With love,
MARY BAKER EDDY




Extract From A Christmas Letter


_Beloved Students_:--My heart has many rooms: one
of these is sacred to the memory of my students. Into
this upper chamber, where all things are pure and of
good report,--into this sanctuary of love,--I often
retreat, sit silently, and ponder. In this chamber is [15]
memory's wardrobe, where I deposit certain recollec-
tions and rare grand collections once in each year. This
is my Christmas storehouse. Its goods commemorate,
--not so much the Bethlehem babe, as the man of God,
the risen Christ, and the adult Jesus. Here I deposit [20]
the gifts that my dear students offer at the shrine of
Christian Science, and to their lone Leader. Here I talk
once a year,--and this is a bit of what I said in 1890:
"O glorious Truth! O Mother Love! how has the sense
of Thy children grown to behold _Thee_! and how have [25]
many weary wings sprung upward! and how has our
Model, Christ, been unveiled to us, and to the age!"

I look at the rich devices in embroidery, silver, gold,
and jewels,--all gifts of Christian Scientists from all
parts of our nation, and some from abroad,--then al- [30]

[Page 160.]

most marvel at the power and permanence of affection [1]
under the _regime_ of Christian Science! Never did grati-
tude and love unite more honestly in uttering the word
_thanks_, than ours at this season. But a mother's love
behind words has no language; it may give no material [5]
token, but lives steadily on, through time and circum-
stance, as part and paramount portion of her being.

Thus may our lives flow on in the same sweet rhythm
of head and heart, till they meet and mingle in bliss super-
nal. There is a special joy in knowing that one is gaining [10]
constantly in the knowledge of Truth and divine Love.
Your progress, the past year, has been marked. It satis-
fies my present hope. Of this we rest assured, that every
trial of our faith in God makes us stronger and firmer in
understanding and obedience. [15]

Lovingly yours,
MARY BAKER G. EDDY





CHAPTER VI. SERMONS.


[Page 161.]




A Christmas Sermon


Delivered in Chickering Hall, Boston, Mass., on the
Sunday Before Christmas, 1888

SUBJECT: _The Corporeal and Incorporeal Saviour_

TEXT: _For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the_ [5]
_government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called_
_Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The_
_Prince of Peace._--ISAIAH ix. 6.

To the senses, Jesus was the son of man: in Science,
man is the son of God. The material senses could [10]
not cognize the Christ, or Son of God: it was Jesus'
approximation to this state of being that made him the
Christ-Jesus, the Godlike, the anointed.

The prophet whose words we have chosen for our
text, prophesied the appearing of this dual nature, as [15]
both human and divinely endowed, the personal and the
impersonal Jesus.

The only record of our Master as a public benefactor,
or personal Saviour, opens when he was thirty years of
age; owing in part, perhaps, to the Jewish law that none [20]
should teach or preach in public under that age. Also,
it is natural to conclude that at this juncture he was
specially endowed with the Holy Spirit; for he was given
the new name, Messiah, or Jesus Christ,--the God-

[Page 162.]

anointed; even as, at times of special enlightenment, [1]
Jacob was called Israel; and Saul, Paul.

The third event of this eventful period,--a period of
such wonderful spiritual import to mankind!--was the
advent of a higher Christianity. [5]

From this dazzling, God-crowned summit, the Naza-
rene stepped suddenly before the people and their schools
of philosophy; Gnostic, Epicurean, and Stoic. He must
stem these rising angry elements, and walk serenely over
their fretted, foaming billows. [10]

Here the cross became the emblem of Jesus' history;
while the central point of his Messianic mission was peace,
good will, love, teaching, and healing.

Clad with divine might, he was ready to stem the tide
of Judaism, and prove his power, derived from Spirit, to [15]
be supreme; lay himself as a lamb upon the altar of
materialism, and therefrom rise to his nativity in Spirit.

The corporeal Jesus bore our infirmities, and through
his stripes we are healed. He was the Way-shower, and
suffered in the flesh, showing mortals how to escape from [20]
the sins of the flesh.

There was no incorporeal Jesus of Nazareth. The
spiritual man, or Christ, was after the similitude of the
Father, without corporeality or finite mind.

Materiality, worldliness, human pride, or self-will, by [25]
demoralizing his motives and Christlikeness, would have
dethroned his power as the Christ.

To carry out his holy purpose, he must be oblivious of
human self.

Of the lineage of David, like him he went forth, simple [30]
as the shepherd boy, to disarm the Goliath. Panoplied
in the strength of an exalted hope, faith, and understand-

[Page 163.]

ing, he sought to conquer the three-in-one of error: the [1]
world, the flesh, and the devil.

Three years he went about doing good. He had for
thirty years been preparing to heal and teach divinely;
but his three-years mission was a marvel of glory: its [5]
chaplet, a grave to mortal sense dishonored--from which
sprang a sublime and everlasting victory!

He who dated time, the Christian era, and spanned
eternity, was the meekest man on earth. He healed
and taught by the wayside, in humble homes: to arrant [10]
hypocrite and to dull disciples he explained the Word
of God, which has since ripened into interpretation
through Science.

His words were articulated in the language of a de-
clining race, and committed to the providence of God. [15]
In no one thing seemed he less human and more divine
than in his unfaltering faith in the immortality of Truth.
Referring to this, he said, "Heaven and earth shall
pass away, but my words shall not pass away!" and
they have not: they still live; and are the basis of divine [20]
liberty, the medium of Mind, the hope of the race.

Only three years a personal Saviour! yet the founda-
tions he laid are as eternal as Truth, the chief corner-stone.

After his brief brave struggle, and the crucifixion of [25]
the corporeal man, the incorporeal Saviour--the Christ
or spiritual idea which leadeth into all Truth--must
needs come in Christian Science, demonstrating the spir-
itual healing of body and mind.

This idea or divine essence was, and is, forever about [30]
the Father's business; heralding the Principle of health,
holiness, and immortality.

[Page 164.]

Its divine Principle interprets the incorporeal idea, or [1]
Son of God; hence the incorporeal and corporeal are
distinguished thus: the former is the spiritual idea that
represents divine good, and the latter is the human
presentation of goodness in man. The Science of Chris- [5]
tianity, that has appeared in the ripeness of time, re-
veals the incorporeal Christ; and this will continue
to be seen more clearly until it be acknowledged, under-
stood,--and the Saviour, which is Truth, be compre-
hended. [10]

To the vision of the Wisemen, this spiritual idea of the
Principle of man or the universe, appeared as a star. At
first, the babe Jesus seemed small to mortals; but from
the mount of revelation, the prophet beheld it from the
beginning as the Redeemer, who would present a wonder- [15]
ful manifestation of Truth and Love.

In our text Isaiah foretold, "His name shall be called
Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting
Father, The Prince of Peace."

As the Wisemen grew in the understanding of Christ, [20]
the spiritual idea, it grew in favor with them. Thus it
will continue, as it shall become understood, until man
be found in the actual likeness of his Maker. Their
highest human concept of the man Jesus, that portrayed
him as the only Son of God, the only begotten of the [25]
Father, full of grace and Truth, will become so magnified
to human sense, by means of the lens of Science, as to
reveal man collectively, as individually, to be the son of
God.

The limited view of God's ideas arose from the testimony [30]
of the senses. Science affords the evidence that God is the
Father of man, of all that is real and eternal. This spir-

[Page 165.]

itual idea that the personal Jesus demonstrated, casting [1]
out evils and healing, more than eighteen centuries ago,
disappeared by degrees; both because of the ascension
of Jesus, in which it was seen that he had grown beyond
the human sense of him, and because of the corruption of [5]
the Church.

The last appearing of Truth will be a wholly spiritual
idea of God and of man, without the fetters of the flesh, or
corporeality. This infinite idea of infinity will be, is, as
eternal as its divine Principle. The daystar of this appear- [10]
ing is the light of Christian Science--the Science which
rends the veil of the flesh from top to bottom. The light
of this revelation leaves nothing that is material; neither
darkness, doubt, disease, nor death. The material cor-
poreality disappears; and individual spirituality, perfect [15]
and eternal, appears--never to disappear.

The truth uttered and lived by Jesus, who passed on
and left to mortals the rich legacy of what he said and
did, makes his followers the heirs to his example; but
they can neither appreciate nor appropriate his treasures [20]
of Truth and Love, until lifted to these by their own
growth and experiences. His goodness and grace pur-
chased the means of mortals' redemption from sin; but,
they never paid the price of sin. This cost, none but the
sinner can pay; and accordingly as this account is settled [25]
with divine Love, is the sinner ready to avail himself of
the rich blessings flowing from the teaching, example,
and suffering of our Master.

The secret stores of wisdom must be discovered, their
treasures reproduced and given to the world, before man [30]
can truthfully conclude that he has been found in the
order, mode, and virgin origin of man according to divine

[Page 166.]

Science, which alone demonstrates the divine Principle [1]
and spiritual idea of being.

The monument whose finger points upward, commemorates
the earthly life of a martyr; but this is not all of
the philanthropist, hero, and Christian. The Truth he [5]
has taught and spoken lives, and moves in our midst a
divine afflatus. Thus it is that the ideal Christ--or
impersonal infancy, manhood, and womanhood of Truth
and Love--is still with us.

And what of _this_ child?--"For unto us a child _is_ [10]
born, unto us a son _is_ given: and the government shall
be upon his shoulder."

This child, or spiritual idea, has evolved a more ready
ear for the overture of angels and the scientific under-
standing of Truth and Love. When Christ, the incor- [15]
poreal idea of God, was nameless, and a Mary knew not
how to declare its spiritual origin, the idea of man was
not understood. The Judaean religion even required the
Virgin-mother to go to the temple and be purified, for
having given birth to the corporeal child Jesus, whose [20]
origin was more spiritual than the senses could inter-
pret. Like the leaven that a certain woman hid in three
measures of meal, the Science of God and the spiritual
idea, named in this century Christian Science, is leaven-
ing the lump of human thought, until the whole shall [25]
be leavened and all materialism disappear. This action
of the divine energy, even if not acknowledged, has
come to be seen as diffusing richest blessings. This
spiritual idea, or Christ, entered into the minutiae of the
life of the personal Jesus. It made him an honest man, [30]
a good carpenter, and a good man, before it could make
him the glorified.

[Page 167.]

The material questions at this age on the reappearing [1]
of the infantile thought of God's man, are after the man-
ner of a mother in the flesh, though their answers per-
tain to the spiritual idea, as in Christian Science:--

Is he deformed? [5]

He is wholly symmetrical; the one altogether lovely.

Is the babe a son, or daughter?

Both son and daughter: even the compound idea of
all that resembles God.

How much does he weigh? [10]

His substance outweighs the material world.

How old is he?

Of his days there is no beginning and no ending.

What is his name?

Christ Science. [15]

Who are his parents, brothers, and sisters?

His Father and Mother are divine Life, Truth, and
Love; and they who do the will of his Father are his is
brethren.

Is he heir to an estate? [20]

"The government shall be upon his shoulder!" He
has dominion over the whole earth; and in admiration
of his origin, he exclaims, "I thank Thee, O Father, Lord
of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things
from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto [25]
babes!"

Is he wonderful?

His works thus prove him. He giveth power, peace,
and holiness; he exalteth the lowly; he giveth liberty

[Page 168.]
