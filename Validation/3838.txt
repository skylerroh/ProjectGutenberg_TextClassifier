THE CELEBRATED
_COLD-ROLLED SHAFTING._

This Shafting is in every particular superior to any turned Shafting
ever made. It is the most ECONOMICAL SHAFTING to buy, being so very
much stronger than turned Shafting. Less diameter answers every
purpose, causing a great saving in coupling, pulleys and hangers.
It is perfectly round, and made to Whitworth Gage. All who give it a
trial continue to use it exclusively. We have it in large quantities.
Call and examine it, or send for price list.

EPILEPSY OR FITS.

A sure cure for this distressing complaint is now made known in
a Treatise of 48 octavo pages, on Foreign and Native Herbal
Preparations, published by Dr. O. Phelps Brown. The prescription
was discovered by him in such a providential manner that he cannot
conscientiously refuse to make it known, as it has cured everybody
who has used it for Fits, never having failed in a single case. The
ingredients may be obtained from any druggist. Persons desiring a copy
may address Dr. O. Phelps Brown, No. 21 Grand Street, Jersey City,
