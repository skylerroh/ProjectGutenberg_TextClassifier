
"I can get a boy, who will answer very well for a fireman."

"I think not, Lawry. You need a man of experience and judgment. He
can save his wages for you in coal. The man whom I employed as a
fireman is just the person, and he is at the village now."

"What must I pay him, sir?"

"Two dollars a day. Then your parties will want some dinner on
board, and you will need a cook, and two stewards. A woman to do the
cooking, and two girls to tend the table, will answer your purpose.
You can obtain the three for about seven dollars a week; but your
passengers must pay extra for their meals, and you need not charge
the expenses of the steward's department to the boat."

"If you expect to succeed, Lawry, you must do your work well. Your
boat must be safe and comfortable, and your dinners nice and well
served. You will want two deck-hands. Your expenses, including coal,
oil for machinery, and hands, will be about twenty dollars a day. If
you add repairs, of which steamboats are continually in need, you
will run it up to twenty-five dollars a day."

"That will leave me a profit of twenty-five dollars a day," added
Lawry, delighted at the thought.

"If you are employed every day, it will; but you cannot expect to do
anything with parties for more than two months in the year."

"I can get some towing to do; and I may make something with
passengers."

"Parties will pay best in July and August, and perhaps part of
September; but you must be wide-awake."

"I intend to be."

"I advise you to get up a handbill of your steamer, announcing that
she is to be let to parties by the day, at all the large ports on the
lake. There are plenty of wealthy people, spending the summer in this
vicinity, who would be glad to engage her, even for a week at once."

"Will you write me a handbill, Mr. Sherwood?"

"Yes, and get it printed."

"Thank you, sir."

"The _Woodville_ is engaged to me for to-morrow," added Mr.
Sherwood.




CHAPTER XV

THE NEW CAPTAIN


Lawry was bewildered by the magnificence of the arrangements
suggested by Mr. Sherwood; but if the _Woodville_ was to be
employed in taking out parties of genteel people, nothing less
magnificent would answer the purpose. His influential friend, it
appeared, had already exerted himself to procure employment of this
kind for the steamer, and the proprietor of the beautiful craft was
not only willing to conform to his ideas, but was grateful for the
kindly interest he manifested in the prosperity of the enterprise.

Mrs. Wilford had engaged a cook, and two girls for the steward's
department; the fireman was sent for; and two boys were employed as
deck-hands.

Now, Lawry thought it was quite necessary that his crew should be
trained a little before any passengers were received on board, and
after Mr. Sherwood and his party had gone home, the fires were
revived, and a short trip down the lake determined upon. As soon as
there was steam enough for the purpose, the pilot, now the captain,
rang his bell to back her, and the deck-hands were instructed in
getting the fasts on board. Ben Wilford, who was standing on the
wharf, cast off the hawsers, and then jumped aboard, himself. The
bells jingled for a few moments, and then the _Woodville_ went
off on her course.

"This is all very fine," said Ben.

"First-rate," laughed Lawry.

"What am I to do?" demanded Ben, rather gruffly.

"You?" said the pilot.

"Everybody seems to have something to do with her except me."

"What do you want to do?"

"I suppose you think I'm not fit for anything."

"I had an idea that you would stay at home, and run the ferry-boat."

"Did you?" sneered Ben.

"Some one must do that; and of course I can't now."

"Hang the ferry-boat!"

"It must be run, or we shall forfeit the privilege."

"I shall not run it, whatever happens."

"I don't see how I can."

"Lawry, I don't think you are using me right," added Ben sourly.

"Why, what have I done?"

"You've got this boat, and though you know I'm a steamboat man, you
don't say a word to me about taking any position on board of her."

"I don't know what position there is on board for you, unless you
take a deck-hand's place."

"A deck-hand!"

"That is what you have always been."

"Do you think I'm going to be bossed by you?"

"Ben, if you will tell me just what you want, I shall understand you
better," said Lawry, rather impatiently.

"You know what I want. There is only one place in the boat I would
be willing to take."

"You mean captain."

"Of course I do."

"I intended to be captain myself."

"I thought you were going to be pilot of her."

"So I am; and captain, too."

"Then you mean to leave me out entirely."

"Ben, I don't want to have any row; and I won't quarrel with my
brother; but I don't think it is quite fair for you to ask so much of
me."

"Don't I know all about a steamboat?"

"Can you pilot one up and down the lake?"

"Well, no; I never did that kind of work."

"Can you run an engine?"

"No; and you can't, either. The captain doesn't have to be a pilot,
nor an engineer."

"What must he do, then?"

"He must look out for everything, make the landing, and see that the
people on board are comfortable."

"I intend to do all that."

"How can you do it, and stay in the wheel-house?"

"I shall not stay there all the time. The deck-hands know how to
steer. I want to do what's fair and right, Ben. The steamer was given
to me; and I don't exactly like to have any one to boss me on board."

"The captain don't have much to do with the pilot, and I sha'n't
boss you."

"Suppose the question should come up, whether or not the boat should
take a certain job; who would decide the question--you or I?"

"I'm the oldest, and I think I ought to have the biggest voice in
the matter."

"But the boat is mine," added Lawry, with emphasis.

"As to that, she is just as much mine as she is yours."

"I'm willing to do what's fair and right; but I shall not have any
captain over me in this boat," replied Lawry.

"Lawry, you are my brother," said Ben angrily; "but I don't care for
that. You set yourself up above me; you make me a nobody. I won't
stand it!"

"I don't set myself up above you, Ben."

"Yes, you do. You offered me the place of deck-hand!"

"I didn't ask you to take any place. I'll tell you what I will do,
Ben. I'll talk with mother and Mr. Sherwood about the matter, and if
they think you ought to be captain of the _Woodville_, you shall
be."

"Mr. Sherwood don't know everything."

"I think he would know what is right in a case like this."

"He thinks you are a little god, and I know what he would say."

"I will do as mother says, then."

"What do women know about these things?"

"I don't think Mr. Sherwood or mother would like it if I should give
up the command of this boat to any one."

"Let them lump it, then," replied Ben, as he rushed out of the
wheel-house, incensed beyond measure at Lawry's opposition to his
unreasonable proposal.

Captain Lawry was sorely disturbed by the conduct of his brother. He
could not enjoy his pleasant position at the wheel, and he put the
steamer about, heading her toward Port Rock.

"Lawry," said Ben, returning to the wheel-house, "I want you to tell
me what you are going to do. I'm older than you, and I have seen more
steamboating than you have. I think it's my right to be captain of
this boat."

"I don't think so."

"I don't want to jaw any more about it."

"I'm sure I don't."

"All I've got to say is, that if I don't run this boat no one will."

"What do you mean by that, Ben?" demanded Lawry.

"No matter what I mean. I'm going to have what belongs to me. Once
for all, am I to be captain, or not?"

"No," replied Lawry firmly.

Ben went out of the wheel-house, and the pilot did not see him again
till after the _Woodville_ reached her wharf. Lawry was sadly
grieved at the attitude of his brother; and if Ben had been a
reliable person, fit for the position he aspired to obtain, he would
have yielded the point. But the would-be captain was an intemperate
and dissolute fellow, as unsuitable for the command as he would have
been for the presidency of a bank.

Early on the following morning the supplies for the _Woodville_
were taken on board, and at eight o'clock everything was in readiness
for the reception of Mr. Sherwood's party. The steam was merrily
hissing from the escape-pipe; Ethan was busy, as he always was, in
rubbing down the polished parts of the engine, and Lawry was walking
up and down the forward deck. Quite a collection of people had
assembled on the unfinished wharf and the shore to witness the
departure of the steamer. As Captain Lawry paced the deck, there was
a slight commotion in the crowd, and three persons passed through,
making their way to the deck. One of them was the sheriff who had
arrested the ferryman a few days before. He was followed by Mr.
Taylor, his father's creditor, and Ben Wilford.

"I'm sorry to trouble you, Lawry," said the official; "but I suppose
I must do my duty."

"What's the matter, sir?" asked Lawry. "What have I done?"

"Nothing, my boy. I think this is rather mean business; but I can't
help it," replied the sheriff, as he produced certain documents.
"Your father owes Mr. Taylor a note of nine hundred and fifty
dollars, on which the interest has not been paid for two years,
making the debt ten hundred and sixty-four dollars."

"But the place is mortgaged for that," replied Lawry.

"I have just foreclosed the mortgage; and now I must attach this
steamboat."

"Attach it!" groaned Lawry.

"Such are my orders; your father's place would hardly sell for
enough to pay the debt."

"But this boat is mine," pleaded Lawry.

"You are a minor, Lawry; and your father is entitled by law to all
your earnings, as you have a claim on him for your support. I can't
stop to explain this matter. The steamer is in my possession now,
subject to the decree of the court. I shall appoint a person to take
charge of her and run her for the benefit of the parties in interest."

"That's too bad!" exclaimed Lawry.

"I know it is; but I can't help it," replied the sheriff. "I shall
appoint your brother, and from this time he has full control of her."

It was evident even to Lawry, who had not been informed of his
brother's worst intentions, that Ben was at the bottom of this
conspiracy. Such was indeed the truth. Mr. Taylor was a young man who
had recently inherited a large fortune, which, it was plain, would
soon be squandered, for he was both intemperate and reckless. Ben had
helped him home one night after a drunken carousal, which had been
the beginning of an intimacy between them, for the younger tippler
was not one to neglect an opportunity to secure a wealthy friend.

They had talked together about the _Woodville_ on several
occasions, and Ben had suggested in what manner he might obtain the
debt due him. On the night before the visit of the sheriff to the
steamer, the malignant and jealous brother had repeated to his
dissipated patron the story of his grievances--that he was a "nobody"
at home, and that Lawry wanted to make a deck-hand of him. Though not
a badly disposed man in the main, Taylor listened with interest and
sympathy to the exaggerated and distorted narrative, and the plan by
which Ben was to be put in possession of the steamer was matured.

The creditor went to a lawyer, one of his boon companions, who was
quite willing to make business for himself; and he had looked up the
law and arranged the facts, by which he expected to hold the steamer.
Doubtless it was a very ingenious scheme, and perhaps it is
unfortunate that the case never came to trial, for it involved some
interesting legal points. Thus far the design had been carried out,
and Ben was in command of the steamer, as an employee of the sheriff.

"I won't be as hard with you, Lawry, as you were with me," said Ben,
as he walked up to Lawry in the wheel-house, to which he had
retreated to hide his confusion.

"This is your work, Ben," replied the youth bitterly.

"I was bound to have the command of this steamer, and I have got
it," added Ben, with malignant triumph.

"I know you have; you put Mr. Taylor up to this, or he never would
have done it."

"Don't snarl about it, Lawry; the thing is done, and you can't help
yourself. The sheriff has given me the command of the boat."

"And he has attached the place. Mother will be turned out of house
and home!" cried Lawry, unable to repress his tears.

"No, she won't; that will be all right."

"Oh, Ben! How could you do it?"

"You drove me to it. It is all your fault, Lawry; so you needn't
whine about it. Don't make a fuss; here comes Taylor."

"I don't want to see him," said Lawry, moving toward the door.

"Don't go off; I'm going to take Taylor and his friends up the lake,
