In the Maya scale we have one of the best and most extended examples of
vigesimal numeration ever developed by any race. To show in a more striking
and forcible manner the perfect regularity of the system, the following
tabulation is made of the various Maya units, which will correspond to the
"10 units make one ten, 10 tens make one hundred, 10 hundreds make one
thousand," etc., which old-fashioned arithmetic compelled us to learn in
childhood. The scale is just as regular by twenties in Maya as by tens in
English. It is[364]

  20 hun     = 1 kal          =         20.
  20 kal     = 1 bak          =        400.
  20 bak     = 1 pic          =       8000.
  20 pic     = 1 calab        =    160,000.
  20 calab   = 1 { kinchil  } =  3,200,000.
                 { tzotzceh }
  20 kinchil = 1 alau         = 64,000,000.

The original meaning of _pic_, given in the scale as "a sack," was rather
"a short petticoat, somtimes used as a sack." The word _tzotzceh_ signified
"deerskin." No reason can be given for the choice of this word as a
numeral, though the appropriateness of the others is sufficiently manifest.
No evidence of digital numeration appears in the first 10 units, but,
judging from the almost universal practice of the Indian tribes of both
North and South America, such may readily have been the origin of Maya
counting. Whatever its origin, it certainly expanded and grew into a system
whose perfection challenges our admiration. It was worthy of the splendid
civilization of this unfortunate race, and, through its simplicity and
regularity, bears ample testimony to the intellectual capacity which
originated it.

The only example of vigesimal reckoning which is comparable with that of
the Mayas is the system employed by their northern neighbours, the Nahuatl,
or, as they are more commonly designated, the Aztecs of Mexico. This system
is quite as pure and quite as simple as the Maya, but differs from it in
some important particulars. In its first 20 numerals it is quinary (see p.
141), and as a system must be regarded as quinary-vigesimal. The Maya scale
is decimal through its first 20 numerals, and, if it is to be regarded as a
mixed scale, must be characterized as decimal-vigesimal. But in both these
instances the vigesimal element preponderates so strongly that these, in
common with their kindred number systems of Mexico, Yucatan, and Central
America, are always thought of and alluded to as vigesimal scales. On
account of its importance, the Nahuatl system[365] is given in fuller
detail than most of the other systems I have made use of.

Up to 160,000 the Nahuatl system is as simple and regular in its
construction as the English. But at this point it fails in the formation of
a new unit, or rather in the expression of its new unit by a simple word;
and in the expression of all higher numbers it is forced to resort in some
measure to compound terms, just as the English might have done had it not
been able to borrow from the Italian. The higher numeral terms, under such
conditions, rapidly become complex and cumbersome, as the following
analysis of the number 1,279,999,999 shows.[366] The analysis will be
readily understood when it is remembered that _ipan_ signifies plus.
_Caxtolli onnauhpoaltzonxiquipilli ipan caxtolli onnauhtzonxiquipilli ipan
caxtolli onnauhpoalxiquipilli ipan caxtolli onnauhxiquipilli ipan caxtolli
onnauhtzontli ipan caxtolli onnauhpoalli ipan caxtolli onnaui;_ _i.e._
1,216,000,000 + 60,800,000  + 3,040,000 + 152,000 + 7600 + 380 + 19. To
show the compounding which takes place in the higher numerals, the analysis
may be made more literally, thus:  + (15 + 4) x 400 x 800 + (15 + 4) x 20 x
8000 + (15  + 4) x 8000 + (15 + 4) x 400 + (15 + 4) x 20 + 15  + 4. Of
course this resolution suffers from the fact that it is given in digits
arranged in accordance with decimal notation, while the Nahuatl numerals
express values by a base twice as great. This gives the effect of a
complexity and awkwardness greater than really existed in the actual use of
the scale. Except for the presence of the quinary element the number just
given is really expressed with just as great simplicity as it could be in
English words if our words "million" and "billion" were replaced by
"thousand thousand" and "thousand thousand thousand." If Mexico had
remained undisturbed by Europeans, and science and commerce had been left
to their natural growth and development, uncompounded words would
undoubtedly have been found for the higher units, 160,000, 3,200,000, etc.,
and the system thus rendered as simple as it is possible for a
quinary-vigesimal system to be.

Other number scales of this region are given as follows:


  HUASTECA.[367]

    10.  laluh.
    20.  hum-inic       = 1 man.
    30.  hum-inic-lahu  = 1 man 10.
    40.  tzab-inic      = 2 men.
    50.  tzab-inic-lahu = 2 men 10.
    60.  ox-inic        = 3 men.
    70.  ox-inic-lahu   = 3 men 10.
    80.  tze-tnic       = 4 men.
    90.  tze-ynic-kal-laluh = 4 men and 10.
   100.  bo-inic        = 5 men.
   200.  tzab-bo-inic   = 2 x 5 men.
   300.  ox-bo-inic     = 3 x 5 men.
   400.  tsa-bo-inic    = 4 x 5 men.
   600.  acac-bo-inic   = 6 x 5 men.
   800.  huaxic-bo-inic = 8 x 5 men.
  1000.  xi.
  8000.  huaxic-xi = 8-1000.

The essentially vigesimal character of this system changes in the formation
of some of the higher numerals, and a suspicion of the decimal enters. One
hundred is _boinic_, 5 men; but 200, instead of being simply _lahuh-inic_,
10 men, is _tsa-bo-inic_, 2 x 100, or more strictly, 2 times 5 men.
Similarly, 300 is 3 x 100, 400 is 4 x 100, etc. The word for 1000 is simple
instead of compound, and the thousands appear to be formed wholly on the
decimal base. A comparison of this scale with that of the Nahuatl shows how
much inferior it is to the latter, both in simplicity and consistency.


  TOTONACO.[368]

    10.  cauh.
    20.  puxam.
    30.  puxamacauh    = 20 + 10.
    40.  tipuxam       = 2 x 20.
    50.  tipuxamacauh  = 40 + 10.
    60.  totonpuxam    = 3 x 20.
   100.  quitziz puxum = 5 x 20.
   200.  copuxam       = 10 x 20.
   400.  tontaman.
  1000.  titamanacopuxam = 2 x 400 + 200.

The essential character of the vigesimal element is shown by the last two
numerals. _Tontamen_, the square of 20, is a simple word, and 1000 is, as
it should be, 2 times 400, plus 200. It is most unfortunate that the
numeral for 8000, the cube of 20, is not given.


  CORA.[369]

    10.  tamoamata.
    20.  cei-tevi.
    30.  ceitevi apoan tamoamata = 20 + 10.
    40.  huapoa-tevi  = 2 x 20.
    60.  huaeica-tevi = 3 x 20.
   100.  anxu-tevi    = 5 x 20.
   400.  ceitevi-tevi = 20 x 20.

Closely allied with the Maya numerals and method of counting are those of
the Quiches of Guatemala. The resemblance is so obvious that no detail in
the Quiche scale calls for special mention.


  QUICHE.[370]

    10.  lahuh.
    20.  hu-uinac       = 1 man.
    30.  hu-uinac-lahuh = 20 + 10.
    40.  ca-uinac       = 2 men.
    50.  lahu-r-ox-kal  = -10 + 3 x 20.
    60.  ox-kal         = 3 x 20.
    70.  lahu-u-humuch  = -10 + 80.
    80.  humuch.
    90.  lahu-r-ho-kal  = -10 + 100.
   100.  hokal.
  1000.  o-tuc-rox-o-kal.

Among South American vigesimal systems, the best known is that of the
Chibchas or Muyscas of the Bogota region, which was obtained at an early
date by the missionaries who laboured among them. This system is much less
extensive than that of some of the more northern races; but it is as
extensive as almost any other South American system with the exception of
the Peruvian, which was, however, a pure decimal system. As has already
been stated, the native races of South America were, as a rule, exceedingly
deficient in regard to the number sense. Their scales are rude, and show
great poverty, both in formation of numeral words and in the actual extent
to which counting was carried. If extended as far as 20, these scales are
likely to become vigesimal, but many stop far short of that limit, and no
inconsiderable number of them fail to reach even 5. In this respect we are
reminded of the Australian scales, which were so rudimentary as really to
preclude any proper use of the word "system" in connection with them.
Counting among the South American tribes was often equally limited, and
even less regular. Following are the significant numerals of the scale in
question:


  CHIBCHA, OR MUYSCA.[371]

    10.  hubchibica.
    20.  quihica ubchihica = thus says the foot, 10 = 10-10,
          or gueta         = house.
    30.  guetas asaqui ubchihica = 20 + 10.
    40.  gue-bosa    = 20 x 2.
    60.  gue-mica    = 20 x 3.
    80.  gue-muyhica = 20 x 4.
   100.  gue-hisca   = 20 x 5.


  NAGRANDA.[372]

    10.  guha.
    20.  dino.
    30.  'badinoguhanu = 20 + 10.
    40.  apudino       = 2 x 20.
    50.  apudinoguhanu = 2 x 20 + 10.
    60.  asudino       = 3 x 20.
    70.  asudinoguhanu = 3 x 20 + 10.
    80.  acudino       = 4 x 20.
    90.  acudinoguhanu = 4 x 20 + 10.
   100.  huisudino     = 5 x 20,
          or guhamba   = great 10.
   200.  guahadino     = 10 x 20.
   400.  dinoamba      = great 20.
  1000.  guhaisudino   = 10 x 5 x 20.
  2000.  hisudinoamba  = 5 great 20's.
  4000.  guhadinoamba  = 10 great 20's.

In considering the influence on the manners and customs of any people which
could properly be ascribed to the use among them of any other base than 10,
it must not be forgotten that no races, save those using that base, have
ever attained any great degree of civilization, with the exception of the
ancient Aztecs and their immediate neighbours, north and south. For reasons
already pointed out, no highly civilized race has ever used an exclusively
quinary system; and all that can be said of the influence of this mode of
counting is that it gives rise to the habit of collecting objects in groups
of five, rather than of ten, when any attempt is being made to ascertain
their sum. In the case of the subsidiary base 12, for which the Teutonic
races have always shown such a fondness, the dozen and gross of commerce,
the divisions of English money, and of our common weights and measures are
probably an outgrowth of this preference; and the Babylonian base, 60, has
fastened upon the world forever a sexagesimal method of dividing time, and
of measuring the circumference of the circle.

The advanced civilization attained by the races of Mexico and Central
America render it possible to see some of the effects of vigesimal
counting, just as a single thought will show how our entire lives are
influenced by our habit of counting by tens. Among the Aztecs the universal
unit was 20. A load of cloaks, of dresses, or other articles of convenient
size, was 20. Time was divided into periods of 20 days each. The armies
were numbered by divisions of 8000;[373] and in countless other ways the
vigesimal element of numbers entered into their lives, just as the decimal
enters into ours; and it is to be supposed that they found it as useful and
as convenient for all measuring purposes as we find our own system; as the
tradesman of to-day finds the duodecimal system of commerce; or as the
Babylonians of old found that singularly curious system, the sexagesimal.
Habituation, the laws which the habits and customs of every-day life impose
upon us, are so powerful, that our instinctive readiness to make use of any
concept depends, not on the intrinsic perfection or imperfection which
pertains to it, but on the familiarity with which previous use has invested
it. Hence, while one race may use a decimal, another a quinary-vigesimal,
and another a sexagesimal scale, and while one system may actually be
inherently superior to another, no user of one method of reckoning need
ever think of any other method as possessing practical inconveniences, of
which those employing it are ever conscious. And, to cite a single instance
which illustrates the unconscious daily use of two modes of reckoning in
one scale, we have only to think of the singular vigesimal fragment which
remains to this day imbedded in the numeral scale of the French. In
counting from 70 to 100, or in using any number which lies between those
limits, no Frenchman is conscious of employing a method of numeration less
simple or less convenient in any particular, than when he is at work with
the strictly decimal portions of his scale. He passes from the one style of
counting to the other, and from the second back to the first again,
entirely unconscious of any break or change; entirely unconscious, in fact,
that he is using any particular system, except that which the daily habit
of years has made a part himself.

Deep regret must be felt by every student of philology, that the primitive
meanings of simple numerals have been so generally lost. But, just as the
pebble on the beach has been worn and rounded by the beating of the waves
and by other pebbles, until no trace of its original form is left, and
until we can say of it now only that it is quartz, or that it is diorite,
so too the numerals of many languages have suffered from the attrition of
the ages, until all semblance of their origin has been lost, and we can say
of them only that they are numerals. Beyond a certain point we can carry
the study neither of number nor of number words. At that point both the
mathematician and the philologist must pause, and leave everything beyond
to the speculations of those who delight in nothing else so much as in pure
theory.
