
So now he made sure that a tree was going to fall clear and just where
he wanted it. Then he sat up on his hind legs, and with his great broad
tail for a brace, began to make the chips fly. You know Paddy has the
most wonderful teeth for cutting. They are long and broad and sharp.
He would begin by making a deep bite, and then another just a little
way below. Then he would pry out the little piece of wood between.
When he had cut very deep on one side so that the tree would fall that
way, he would work around to the other side. Just as soon as the tree
began to lean and he was sure that it was going to fall, he would
scamper away so as to be out of danger. He loved to see those tall
trees lean forward slowly, then faster and faster, till they struck
the ground with a crash.

Just as soon as they were down, he would trim off the branches until
the trees were just long poles. This was easy work, for he could take
off a good-sized branch with one bite. On many he left their bushy
tops. When he had trimmed them to suit him and had cut them into the
right lengths, he would tug and pull them down to the place where he
meant to build his dam.

There he placed the poles side by side, not across the Laughing Brook
like a bridge, but with the big ends pointing up the Laughing Brook,
which was quite broad but shallow right there. To keep them from
floating away, he rolled stones and piled mud on the bushy ends. Clear
across on both sides he laid those poles until the land began to rise.
Then he dragged more poles and piled on top of these and wedged short
sticks crosswise between them.

And all the time the Laughing Brook was having harder and harder work
to run. Its merry laugh grew less merry and finally almost stopped,
because, you see, the water could not get through between all those
poles and sticks fast enough. It was just about that time that the
little people of the Smiling Pool decided that it was time to see just
what Paddy was doing, and they started up the Laughing Brook, leaving
only Grandfather Frog and the tadpoles in the Smiling Pool, which for a
little while would smile no more.

PADDY HAS MANY VISITORS


Paddy the Beaver knew perfectly well that he would have visitors just
as soon as he began to build his dam. He expected a lot of them. You
see, he knew that none of them ever had seen a Beaver at work unless
perhaps it was Prickly Porky the Porcupine, who also had come down
from the North. So as he worked he kept his ears open, and he smiled
to himself as he heard a little rustle here and then a little rustle
there. He knew just what those little rustles meant. Each one meant
another visitor. Yes, Sir, each rustle meant another visitor, and yet
not one had shown himself.

Paddy chuckled. "Seems to me that you are dreadfully afraid to show
yourselves," said he in a loud voice, just as if he were talking to
nobody in particular. Everything was still. There wasn't so much as a
rustle after Paddy spoke. He chuckled again. He could just _feel_ ever
so many eyes watching him, though he didn't see a single pair. And he
knew that the reason his visitors were hiding so carefully was because
they were afraid of him. You see, Paddy was much bigger than most of the
little meadow and forest people, and they didn't know what kind of a
temper he might have. It is always safest to be very distrustful of
strangers. That is one of the very first things taught all little meadow
and forest children.

Of course, Paddy knew all about this. He had been brought up that way.
"Be sure, and then you'll never be sorry" had been one of his mother's
favorite sayings, and he had always remembered it. Indeed, it had saved
him a great deal of trouble. So now he was perfectly willing to go right
on working and let his hidden visitors watch him until they were sure
that he meant them no harm. You see, he himself felt quite sure that
none of them was big enough to do him any harm. Little Joe Otter was
the only one he had any doubts about, and he felt quite sure that Little
Joe wouldn't try to pick a quarrel. So he kept right on cutting trees,
trimming off the branches, and hauling the trunks down to the dam he
was building. Some of them he floated down the Laughing Brook. This
was easier.

Now when the little people of the Smiling Pool, who were the first to
find out that Paddy the Beaver had come to the Green Forest, had started
up the Laughing Brook to see what he was doing, they had told the Merry
Little Breezes where they were going. The Merry Little Breezes had been
greatly excited. They couldn't understand how a stranger could have been
living in the Green Forest without their knowledge. You see, they quite
forgot that they very seldom wandered to the deepest part of the Green
Forest. Of course they started at once as fast as they could go to tell
all the other little people who live on or around the Green Meadows, all
but Old Man Coyote. For some reason they thought it best not to tell
him. They were a little doubtful about Old Man Coyote. He was so big and
strong and so sly and smart that all his neighbors were afraid of him.
Perhaps the Merry Little Breezes had this fact in mind, and knew that
none would dare go to call on the stranger if they knew that Old Man
Coyote was going too. Anyway, they simply passed the time of day with
Old Man Coyote and hurried on to tell every one else, and the very last
one they met was Sammy Jay.

Sammy was terribly put out to think that anything should be going on
that he didn't know about first. You know he is very fond of prying into
the affairs of other people, and he loves dearly to boast that there is
nothing going on in the Green Forest or on the Green Meadows that he
doesn't know about. So now his pride was hurt, and he was in a terrible
rage as he started after the Merry Little Breezes for the place deep in
the Green Forest where they said Paddy the Beaver was at work. He didn't
believe a word of it, but he would see for himself.

SAMMY JAY SPEAKS HIS MIND


When Sammy Jay reached the place deep in the Green Forest where Paddy
the Beaver was so hard at work, he didn't hide as had the little
four-footed people. You see, of course, he had no reason to hide,
because he felt perfectly safe. Paddy had just cut a big tree, and it
fell with a crash as Sammy came hurrying up. Sammy was so surprised
that for a minute he couldn't find his tongue. He had not supposed
that anybody but Farmer Brown or Farmer Brown's boy could cut down so
large a tree as that, and it quite took his breath away. But he got it
again in a minute. He was boiling with anger, anyway, to think that he
should have been the last to learn that Paddy had come down from the
North to make his home in the Green Forest, and here was a chance to
speak his mind.

"Thief! thief! thief!" he screamed in his harshest voice.

Paddy the Beaver looked up with a twinkle in his eyes. "Hello, Mr. Jay!
I see you haven't any better manners than your cousin who lives up where
I came from," said he.

"Thief! thief! thief!" screamed Sammy, hopping up and down, he was
so angry.

"Meaning yourself, I suppose," said Paddy. "I never did see an honest
Jay, and I don't suppose I ever will."

"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Peter Rabbit, who had quite forgotten that he
was hiding.

"Oh, how do you do, Mr. Rabbit? I'm very glad you have called on me this
morning," said Paddy, just as if he hadn't known all the time just where
Peter was. "Mr. Jay seems to have gotten out of the wrong side of his
bed this morning."

Peter laughed again. "He always does," said he. "If he didn't, he
wouldn't be happy. You wouldn't think it to look at him, but he is happy
right now. He doesn't know it, but he is. He always is happy when he can
show what a bad temper he has."

Sammy Jay glared down at Peter. Then he glared at Paddy. And all the
time he still shrieked "Thief!" as hard as ever he could. Paddy kept
right on working, paying no attention to Sammy. This made Sammy more
angry than ever. He kept coming nearer and nearer until at last he
was in the very tree that Paddy happened to be cutting. Paddy's
eyes twinkled.

"I'm no thief!" he exclaimed suddenly.

"You are! You are! Thief! Thief!" shrieked Sammy. "You're stealing
our trees!"

"They're not your trees," retorted Paddy. "They belong to the Green
Forest, and the Green Forest belongs to all who love it, and we all have
a perfect right to take what we need from it. I need these trees, and
I've just as much right to take them as you have to take the fat acorns
that drop in the fall."

"No such thing!" screamed Sammy. You know he can't talk without
screaming, and the more excited he gets, the louder he screams. "No such
thing! Acorns are food. They are meant to eat. I have to have them to
live. But you are cutting down whole trees. You are spoiling the Green
Forest. You don't belong here. Nobody invited you, and nobody wants you.
You're a thief!"

Then up spoke Jerry Muskrat, who, you know, is cousin to Paddy
the Beaver.

"Don't you mind him," said he, pointing at Sammy Jay. "Nobody does.
He's the greatest trouble-maker in the Green Forest or on the Green
Meadows. He would steal from his own relatives. Don't mind what he
says, Cousin Paddy."

Now all this time Paddy had been working away just as if no one was
around. Just as Jerry stopped speaking, Paddy thumped the ground with
his tail, which is his way of warning people to watch out, and suddenly
scurried away as fast as he could run. Sammy Jay was so surprised that
he couldn't find his tongue for a minute, and he didn't notice anything
peculiar about that tree. Then suddenly he felt himself falling. With a
frightened scream, he spread his wings to fly, but branches of the tree
swept him down with them right into the Laughing Brook.

You see while Sammy had been speaking his mind, Paddy the Beaver had cut
down the very tree in which he was sitting.

Sammy wasn't hurt, but he was wet and muddy and terribly
frightened,--the most miserable looking Jay that ever was seen.
It was too much for all the little people who were hiding. They
just had to laugh. Then they all came out to pay their respects
to Paddy the Beaver.

PADDY KEEPS HIS PROMISE


Paddy the Beaver kept right on working just as if he hadn't any
visitors. You see, it is a big undertaking to build a dam. And when that
was done there was a house to build and a supply of food for the winter
to cut and store. Oh, Paddy the Beaver had no time for idle gossip, you
may be sure! So he kept right on building his dam. It didn't look much
like a dam at first, and some of Paddy's visitors turned up their noses
