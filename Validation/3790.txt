     Mattup had killed a man, so it was logical
 he should be punished. It was Danny who came up

It was Orley Mattup's killing of the old lab technician that really made
us hate him.

Mattup was a guard at the reactor installation at Bayless, Kentucky,
where my friend Danny Hern and I were part of the staff when the
Outsiders took everything over. In what god-forsaken mountain hole they
had found Mattup, and how they got him to sell out to them, I don't
know. He was an authentic human, though. You can tell an Outsider.

Mattup and Danny and I were playing high-low-jack the night Uncle Pete
was killed, sitting on the widewalk where Mattup had a view of the part
of the station he was responsible for. High-low-jack is a back-country
card game; Danny had learned it in northern Pennsylvania, where he came
from, and Mattup loved the game, and they had taught it to me because
the game is better three-handed. The evening sessions had been Danny's
idea--I think he figured it might give him a line on Mattup.

On the night in question, Mattup was on a week's losing streak and was
in a foul humor. He was superstitious, and he had called for a new deck
twice that evening and walked around his seat four different times. His
bidding was getting wilder.
