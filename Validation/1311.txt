218     Come to Jesus.

Come to Jesus, come to Jesus,
  Come to Jesus just now,
Just now come to Jesus,
  Come to Jesus just now.

14 Jesus loves you.

15 Don't reject him.

16 Only trust him.

17 Hallelujah. Amen.


219     Who'll Be the Next? P.M.

_Delay Deplored._

Who'll be the next to follow Jesus?
  Who'll be the next the cross to bear?
Someone is ready, someone is waiting;
  Who'll be the next a crown to wear?

Ref.--Who'll be the next? Who'll be the next?
      Who'll be the next to follow Jesus?
      Who'll be the next to follow Jesus now?
      Follow Jesus now?

2 Who'll be the next to follow Jesus--
  Follow his weary, bleeding feet?
Who'll be the next to lay ev'ry burden
  Down at the Father's mercy-seat?

3 Who'll be the next to follow Jesus?
  Who'll be the next to praise his name?
Who'll swell the chorus of free redemption--
  Sing, hallelujah! praise the Lamb?

4 Who'll be the next to follow Jesus,
  Down thro' the Jordan's rolling tide?
Who'll be the next to join with the ransomed,
  Singing upon the other side?

220     Let Him In. P.M.

_The Stranger at the Door._

There's a stranger at the door,
         Let him in,
He has been there oft before,
        Let him in;
Let him in ere he is gone,
Let him in, the Holy One,
Jesus Christ, the Father's Son,
        Let him in.

2 Open now to him your heart,
        Let him in,
If you wait he will depart,
        Let him in;
Let him in, he is your Friend,
He your soul will sure defend,
He will keep you to the end,
        Let him in.

3 Hear you now his loving voice?
        Let him in,
Now, oh, now make him your choice
        Let him in;
He is standing at the door,
Joy to you he will restore,
And his name you will adore,
        Let him in.

4 Now admit the heavenly Guest,
        Let him in,
He will make for you a feast,
        Let him in;
He will speak your sins forgiv'n,
And when earth ties all are riven,
He will take you home to heaven,
        Let him in.

     Rev. J. B. Atchison.


221     Almost Persuaded. P.M.

_"Almost," but Lost._     (475)

"Almost persuaded" now to believe;
"Almost persuaded" Christ to receive;
Seems now some soul to say,
"Go, Spirit, go thy way;
Some more convenient day
  On thee I'll call."

2 "Almost persuaded," come, come to-day;
"Almost persuaded," turn not away,
Jesus invites you here,
Angels are ling'ring near,
Pray'rs rise from hearts so dear;
  Oh, wand'rer, come!

3 "Almost persuaded," harvest is past!
"Almost persuaded," doom comes at last!
"Almost" cannot avail;
"Almost" is but to fail!
Sad, sad that bitter wail,--
  "Almost," but lost!

     P. P. Bliss.


222     To-Day. 6s & 4s.

     (476)

To-day the Savior calls!
  Ye wand'rers, come,
Oh, ye benighted souls,
  Why longer roam?

2 To-day the Savior calls!
  Oh, hear him now;
Within these sacred walls
  To Jesus bow.

3 Today the Savior calls!
  For refuge fly!
The storm of justice falls,
  And death is nigh.

4 The Spirit calls to-day;
  Yield to his power;
Oh, grieve him not away,
  'Tis mercy's hour.


223     Greenville. 8s, 7s, & 4s.

_Invitation Hymn._     (463)

Come, ye sinners, poor and needy,
  Weak and wounded, sick and sore;
Jesus ready stands to save you,
  Full of pity, love, and pow'r;
        He is able,
  He is willing, doubt no more.

2 Now, ye needy, come and welcome;
  God's free bounty glorify;
True belief and true repentance,
  Every grace that brings you nigh,
        Without money,
  Come to Jesus Christ and buy.

3 Let not conscience make you linger,
  Nor of fitness fondly dream;
All the fitness he requireth
  Is to feel your need of him;
        This he gives you;
  'Tis the Spirit's glimmering beam.

4 Come, ye weary, heavy laden,
  Bruised and mangled by the fall;
If you tarry till you're better,
  You will never come at all;
        Not the righteous,--
  Sinners Jesus came to call.

     Joseph Hart, 1759.

Cho.--Turn to the Lord and seek salvation,
        Sound the praise of his dear name:
      Glory, honor, and salvation,
        Christ, the Lord, is come to reign.

Cho.--I will arise and go to Jesus,
        He will embrace me in his arms,
      In the arms of my dear Savior,
        Oh, there are ten thousand charms!


224     Greenville. 8s, 7s, & 4s.

_The Voice of Mercy._     (466)

Listen, sinner! mercy hails you;
  With her sweetest voice she calls;
Bids you hasten to the Savior,
  Ere the hand of justice falls:
        Listen, sinner!
  'Tis the voice of mercy calls.

2 See! the storm of vengeance gathering
  O'er the path you dare to tread!
Hark! the awful thunders rolling
  Loud and louder o'er your head!
        Flee, oh, sinner!
  Lest the lightnings strike you dead.

3 Haste, ah! hasten to the Savior;
  Sue his mercy while you may;
Soon the day of grace is over;
  Soon your life will pass away,
        Hasten sinner!
  You must perish, if you stay.

     Andrew Reed, 1817.


225     Rhinehart. 7s & 6s.

_Penitents Encouraged._     (458)

Dropping souls! no longer mourn,
  Jesus still is precious;
If to him you now return,
  Heav'n will be propitious;
Jesus now is passing by,
  Calling wand'rers near him;
Drooping souls! you need not die,
  Go to him and hear him!

2 He has pardons full and free,
  Drooping souls to gladden;
Still he cries--"Come unto me,
  Weary, heavy laden!"
Tho' your sins, like mountains high,
  Rise, and reach to heaven,
Soon as you on him rely,
  All shall be forgiven.

3 Precious is the Savior's name,
  All his saints adore him;
He to save the dying came;--
  Prostrate bow before him!
Wand'ring sinner! now return;
  Contrite souls! believe him!
Jesus calls you; cease to mourn;
  Worship him; receive him.

     Thomas Hastings. 1831.


226     Are You Ready? 8s & 7s.

_Judgment Day._

Soon the evening shadows falling
  Close the day of mortal life;
Soon the hand of death appalling
  Draws thee from its weary strife.

Cho.--Are you ready? are you ready?
        'Tis the Spirit calling, why delay?
      Are you ready? are you ready?
        Do not linger longer, come to-day.

2 Soon the awful trumpet sounding
  Calls thee to the judgment throne;
Now prepare, for love abounding
  Yet has left thee not alone.

3 Oh, how fatal 'tis to linger!
  Art thou ready--ready now?
Ready should Death's icy finger
  Lay its chill upon thy brow?

4 Priceless love and free salvation
  Freely still are offered thee;
Yield no longer to temptation,
  But from sin and sorrow flee.

     J. W. Slaughenhaupt.


227     Windham. L.M.

_The Broad Road._

Broad is the road that leads to death,
  And thousands walk together there;
But wisdom shows a narrow path,
  With here and there a traveler.

2 "Deny thyself and take thy cross,"
  Is the Redeemer's great command;
Nature must count her gold but dross,
  If she would gain this heavenly land.

3 The fearful soul that tires and faints,
  And walks the ways of God no more,
Is but esteemed almost a saint.
  And makes his own destruction sure.

4 Lord, let not all my hopes be vain;
  Create my heart entirely new--
Which hypocrites could ne'er attain,
  Which false apostates never knew.

     Isaac Watts.


228     Gorton. S.M.

_The Second Death._     (504)

Oh, where shall rest be found--
  Rest for the weary soul?
'Twere vain the ocean depths to sound,
  Or pierce to either pole.

2 The world can never give
  The bliss for which we sigh;
'Tis not the whole of life to live,
  Nor all of death to die.

3 Beyond this vale of tears
  There is a life above,
Unmeasured by the flight of years;
  And all that life is love.

4 There is a death, whose pang
  Outlasts the fleeting breath;
Oh, what eternal horrors hang
  Around the second death!

5 Lord God of truth and grace,
  Teach us that death to shun,
Lest we be banished from thy face,
  And evermore undone.

     James Montgomery, 1819.


229     No Room in Heaven. P.M.

_Shut Out._

How sad would it be, if when thou didst call,
  All hopeless and unforgiven,
The angel that stands at the beautiful gate,
  Should answer, No room in heaven.

Ref.--Sad, sad, sad would it be!
        No room in heaven for thee!
      No room, no room,
        No room in heaven for thee!

2 How sad it would be, the harvest all past,
  The bright summer days all over;
To know that the reapers had gathered the grain,
  And left thee alone forever.

3 Oh, haste thee, and fly, while mercy is near,
  Remember the love that he gave you;
The love that has sought thee is seeking thee still,
  And Jesus now waits to save you.

     W. O. Cushing.


230     When the King Comes in. P.M.

_The Final Test._

Called to the feast by the King are we,
  Sitting, perhaps, where his people be,
How will it fare, friend, with thee and me,
  When the King comes in?

Ref.--When the King comes in, brother,
        When the King comes in!
      How will it fare with thee and me
        When the King comes in?

2 Crowns on the head where the thorns have been,
  Glorified he who once died for men,
Splendid the vision before us then,
  When the King comes in.

3 Like lightning's flash will that instant show
  Things hidden long from both friend and foe,
Just what we are will each neighbor know,
  When the King comes in.

4 Joyful his eye shall on each one rest
  Who is in white wedding garments dressed,
Ah, well for us if we stand the test,
  When the King comes in.

5 Endless the separation then,
  Bitter the cry of deluded men,
Awful that moment beyond all ken,
  When the King comes in.

6 Lord, grant us all, we implore thee, grace,
  So to await thee each in his place,
That we may fear not to see thy face
  When thou comest in.

     J.E. Landor.


231     When the Door is Shut. P.M.

_The Present Invitation._

The door of salvation is open wide,
  And Jesus invites you to come;
While mercy and pardon await within,
  Oh, enter while yet there is room.

Ref.--When the door once is shut,
        To entreat will be vain;
      'Twill never, no, never
        Be opened again.

2 The feast of the gospel awaits its guests,
  The day and the hour are at hand;
Ye hungry and perishing souls, draw near;
  Oh, why do you doubtingly stand?

3 Dear friends, if you ever should stand without,
  And plead for admittance in vain,
You'd think of the Savior's entreating voice,
  And long for this moment again.

     M. E. Servoss.


232     Hebron. L.M.

_My Yoke is Easy, My Burden Light._     (495)

Oh, that my load of sin were gone;
  Oh, that I could at last submit
At Jesus' feet to lay it down--
  To lay my soul at Jesus' feet.

2 Rest for my soul I long to find;
  Savior of all, if mine thou art,
Give me the meek and lowly mind,
  And stamp thine image on my heart.

3 Break off the yoke of inbred sin,
  And fully set my spirit free;
I cannot rest till pure within--
  Till I am wholly lost in thee.

4 Fain would I learn of thee, my God;
  Thy light and easy burden prove;
The cross all stained with hallowed blood,
  The labor of thy dying love.

5 I would, but thou must give the power;
  My heart from every sin release;
Bring near, bring near the joyful hour,
  And fill me with thy perfect peace.

     Charles Wesley, 1742.


233     Hebron. L.M.

_Pardon Penitently Implored._     (493)

Show pity, Lord, O Lord, forgive;
  Let a repenting rebel live;
Are not thy mercies large and free?
  May not a sinner trust in thee?

2 My crimes, though great, cannot surpass
  The power and glory of thy grace;
Great God, thy nature hath no bound,
  So let thy pard'ning love be found.

3 Oh, wash my soul from every sin,
  And make my guilty conscience clean;
Here, on my heart, the burden lies
  And past offenses pain mine eyes.

4 My lips with shame my sins confess,
  Against thy law, against thy grace;
Lord, should thy judgment grow severe,
  I am condemned, but thou art clear.

5 Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord,
  Whose hope, still hovering round thy word,
Would light on some sweet promise there,
  Some sure support against despair.

     Charles Wesley, 1742.


234     Hebron. L.M.

_Deprecating the Withdrawal of the Spirit._   (494)

Stay, thou insulted Spirit, stay,
  Though I have done thee such despite,
Nor cast the sinner quite away,
  Nor take thine everlasting flight.

2 Though I have steeled my stubborn heart,
  And still shook off my guilty fears;
And vexed and urged, thee to depart,
  For many long rebellious years.

3 Though I have most unfaithful been,
  Of all whoe'er thy grace received!
Ten thousand times thy goodness seen;
  Ten thousand times thy goodness grieved;

4 This only woe I deprecate;
  This only plague I pray remove;
Nor leave me in my lost estate;
  Nor curse me with this want of love.

5 Now, Lord, my weary soul release,
  Upraise me with thy gracious hand,
And guide into thy perfect peace,
  And bring me to the promised land.

     Charles Wesley, 1749.


235     Woodworth. L.M.

_Coming in Humility._    (489)

Just as I am, without one plea,
But that thy blood was shed for me,
And that thou bidd'st me come to thee,
  O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

2 Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
  O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

3 Just as I am, tho' tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings within, and fears without,
  O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

4 Just as I am--poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need, in thee to find,
  O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

5 Just as I am--thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because thy promise I believe,
  O Lamb of God, I come! I come!
