A
PRACTICAL DISCOURSE
ON SOME
PRINCIPLES OF HYMN-SINGING

What St. Augustin says of the emotion which he felt on hearing the music
in the Portian basilica at Milan in the year 386 has always seemed to me
a good illustration of the relativity of musical expression; I mean how
much more its ethical significance depends on the musical experience of
the hearer, than on any special accomplishment or intrinsic development
of the art. Knowing of what kind that music must have been and how few
resources of expression it can have had,--being rudimental in form,
without suggestion of harmony, and in its performance unskilful, its
probably nasal voice-production unmodified by any accompaniment,--one
marvels at his description,

  'What tears I shed at Thy hymns and canticles, how acutely was my soul
  stirred by the voices and sweet music of Thy Church! As those voices
  entered my ears, truth distilled in my heart, and thence divine
  affection welled up in a flood, in tears o'erflowing, and happy was I
  in those tears[1].'

St. Augustin appears to have witnessed the beginnings of the great music
of the Western Church. It was the year of his baptism when, he tells us,
singing was introduced at Milan to cheer the Catholics who had shut
themselves up in the basilica with their bishop, to defend him from the
imperial violence:

  'It was then instituted that psalms and hymns should be sung, after the
  manner of the Eastern Churches, lest the folk in the weariness of their
  grief should altogether lose heart: and from that day to this the
  custom has been retained; many, nay, nearly all Thy flocks, in all
  regions of the world, following the example[2].'

What great emotional power St. Augustin attributed to ecclesiastical
music, and of what importance he thought it, may be seen in the tenth
book of the _Confessions_: he is there examining himself under the heads
of the senses, and after the sense of smell, his chapter on the sense of
hearing is as follows:

  'The lust of the ears entangled and enslaved me more firmly, but Thou
  hast loosened and set me free. But even now I confess that I do yield a
  very little to the beauty of those sounds which are animated by Thy
  eloquence, when sung with a sweet and practised voice; not, indeed, so
  far that I am limed and cannot fly off at pleasure[3]: and yield though
  I do, yet these sweet sounds, joined with the divine words which are
  their life, cannot be admitted to my heart save to a place of some
  dignity, and I hesitate to give them one as lofty as their claim[4].

  'For sometimes I seem to myself to be allowing them undue honour, when
  I feel that our minds are really moved to a warmer devotion and more
  ardent piety by the holy words themselves when they are so sung than
  when they are not so sung; and when I recognize that all the various
  moods of our spirit have their proper tones in speech and song, by
  which they are, through I know not what secret familiarity, excited.
  But the mere sensuous delight, to which it is not fitting to resign the
  mind to be enervated thereby, often deceives me, whenever (that is) the
  delight of the senses does not so accompany the reason as to be
  cheerfully in submission thereto, but, having been admitted only for
  reason's sake, then even attempts to go before and to lead. Thus I sin
  without knowing, but afterwards I know.

  'Then awhile, from too immoderate caution against this deception, I err
  on the side of too great severity; and sometimes go so far as to wish
  that all the melody of the sweet chants which are used in the Davidian
  psalter were utterly banished from my ears, and from the ears of the
  Church; and that way seems to me safer which I remember often to have
  heard told of Athanasius, archbishop of Alexandria, that he would have
  the lector of the psalm intone it with but a slight modulation of
  voice, so as to be more like one reading than one singing. And yet,
  when I remember my tears, which I shed at the hearing of the song of
  Thy Church in the first days of my recovered faith, and that now I
  still feel the same emotion, and am moved not by the singing but by
  what is sung, when it is sung with a liquid voice and in the most
  fitting "modulation," then (I say) I acknowledge again the great
  utility of the institution.

  'Thus I fluctuate between the peril of sensuous pleasure and the proof
  of wholesomeness, and am more inclined (though I would not offer an
  irrevocable judgement) to approve of the use of singing in the Church,
  that, by the pleasure of the ear, weaker minds may rise to the emotion
  of piety. Yet when it happens to me to be more moved by the music than
  by the words that are sung I confess that I have sinned (poenaliter
  peccare), and it is then that I would rather not hear the singer[5].'

What would St. Augustin have said could he have heard Mozart's Requiem,
or been present at some Roman Catholic cathedral where an
eighteenth-century mass was performed, a woman hired from the Opera-House
whooping the _Benedictus_ from the western gallery?

It is possible that such music would not have had any ethical
significance to him, bad or good. Augustin lived before what we reckon
the very beginnings of modern music, with nothing to entice and delight
his ears in the choir but the simplest ecclesiastical chant and hymn-tune
sung in unison. We are accustomed to an almost over-elaborated art,
which, having won powers of expression in all directions, has so
squandered them that they are of little value: and we may confidently say
that the emotional power of our church music is not so great as that
described by him 1,500 years ago. In fact if we feel at all out of
sympathy with Augustin's words, it is because he seems to over-estimate
the danger of the emotion[6].

There is something very strange and surprising in this state of things,
this contrast between the primitive Church with its few simple melodies
that ravished the educated hearer, and our own full-blown institution
with its hymn-book of some 600 tunes, which when it is opened fills the
sensitive worshipper with dismay, so that there are persons who would
rather not go inside a church than subject themselves to the trial.
