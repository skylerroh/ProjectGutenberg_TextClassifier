not look upon her, lest he, too, be turned to stone; but, guided
by the reflection in the buckler, smote off her head, carried it
high over Libya, the dropping blood turning to serpents, which
have infested those deserts ever since.

The human mind has always been ready to deify and throne in the
skies the heroes that labor for others. Both Perseus and Hercules
are divine by one parent, and human by the other. They go up and
down the earth, giving deliverance to captives, and breaking every
yoke. They also seek to purge away all evil; they slay dragons,
gorgons, devouring monsters, cleanse the foul places of earth,
and one of them so wrestles with death as to win a victim from his
grasp. Finally, by [Page 201] an ascension in light, they go up to
be in light forever. They are not ideally perfect. They right wrong
by slaying wrong-doers, rather than by being crucified themselves;
they are just murderers; but that only plucks the fruit from the
tree of evil. They never attempted to infuse a holy life. They
punished rather than regenerated. It must be confessed, also, that
they were not sinless. But they were the best saviors the race could
imagine, and are examples of that perpetual effort of the human mind
to incarnate a Divine Helper who shall labor and die for the good of
men.

_Equatorial Constellations._

If we turn our backs on Polaris on the 10th of November, at 10
o'clock in the evening, and look directly overhead, we shall see
the beautiful constellation of Andromeda. Together with the square
of Pegasus, it makes another enormous dipper. The star a Alpheratz
is in her face, the three at the left cross her breast. b and the
two above mark the girdle of her loins, and g is in the foot. Perseus
is near enough for help; and Cetus, the sea-monster, is far enough
away to do no harm. Below, and east of Andromeda, is the Ram of
the golden fleece, recognizable by the three stars in an acute
triangle. The brightest is called Arietis, or Hamel. East of this
are the Pleiades, and the V-shaped Hyades in Taurus, or the Bull.
The Pleiades rise about 9 o'clock on the evening of the 10th of
September, and at 3 o'clock A.M. on June 10th.

[Page 203]
[Illustration: Fig. 69.--Capella (45 deg. from the Pole) and Rigel
(100 deg.) are on the Meridian at 8 o'clock February 7th, 9 o'clock
January 22d, and at 10 o'clock January 7th.]

Fig. 69 extends east and south of our last map. It is the most
gorgeous section of our heavens. (See the Notes to the Frontispiece.)
Note the triangle, 26 deg. on a side, made by Betelguese, Sirius, and
Procyon. A line from Procyon to Pollux leads quite near to Polaris.
Orion is the mighty hunter. Under his feet is a hare, behind him
are two dogs, and before him is the rushing bull. The curve of
stars to the right of Bellatrix, g, represents his shield of the
Nemean lion's hide. The three stars of his belt make a measure
3 deg. long; the upper one, Mintaker, is less than 30' south of the
equinoctial. The ecliptic passes between Aldebaran and the Pleiades.
Sirius rises about 9 o'clock P.M. on the 1st of December, and about
4 o'clock A.M. on the 16th of August. Procyon rises about half an
hour earlier.

[Page 204]
[Illustration: Fig. 70--Regulus comes on the Meridian, 79 deg. south
from the Pole, at 10 o'clock March 23d, 9 o'clock April 8th, and
at 8 o'clock April 23d.]

Fig. 70 continues eastward. Note the sickle in the head and neck
of the Lion. The star b is Denebola, in his tail. Arcturus appears
by the word Bootes, at the edge of the map. These two stars make
a triangle with Spica, about 35 deg. on a side. The geometric head of
Hydra is easily discernible east of Procyon: The star g in the
Virgin is double, with a period of 145 years. z is just above the
equinoctial. There is a fine nebula two-thirds of the way from d to
ae, and a little above the line connecting the two. Coma Berenices
is a beautiful cluster of faint stars. Spica rises at 9 o'clock on
the 10th of February, at 5 o'clock A.M. on the 6th of November.

[Page 205]
[Illustration: Fig. 7l.--Arcturus comes to the Meridian, 70 deg. from
the Pole, at 10 o'clock May 25th, 9 o'clock June 9th, and at 8
o'clock June 25th.]

Fig. 71 represents the sky to the eastward and northward of the
last. A line drawn from Polaris and Benetnasch comes east of Arcturus
to the little triangle called his sons. Bootes drives the Great
Bear round the pole. Arcturus and Denebola make a triangle with
a, also called Cor Coroli, in the Hunting Dogs. This triangle, and
the one having the same base, with Spica for its apex, is called
the "Diamond of the Virgin." Hercules appears head down--a in the
face, b, g, d; in his shoulders, p; and ae; in the loins, t in the
knee, the foot being bent to the stars at the right. The Serpent's
head, making an X, is just at the right of the g of Hercules, and
the partial circle of the Northern Crown above. The head of Draco
is seen at b on the left of the map. Arcturus rises at 9 o'clock
about the 20th of February, and at 5 A.M. on the 22d of October;
Regulus 3h. 35m. Earlier.

[Page 206]
[Illustration: Fig. 72.--Altair comes to the Meridian, 82 deg. from
the Pole, at 10 o'clock P.M. August 18th, at 9 o'clock September
2d, and at 8 o'clock September 18th.]

Fig. 72 portrays the stars eastward and southward. Scorpio is one
of the most brilliant and easily traced constellations. Antares, a,
in the heart, is double. In Sagittarius is the Little Milk-dipper,
and west of it the bended bow. Vega is at the top of the map. Near
it observe z, a double, and e, a quadruple star. The point to which
the solar system is tending is marked by the sign of the earth
below p; Herculis. The Serpent, west of Hercules, and coiled round
nearly to Aquila, is very traceable. In the right-hand lower corner
is the Centaur. Below, and always out of our sight, is the famous
a Centauri. The diamond form of the Dolphin is sometimes called
"Job's Coffin." The ecliptic passes close [Page 207] to b of
Scorpio, which star is in the head. Antares, in Scorpio, rises at 9
o'clock P.M. on May 9th, and at 5 o'clock A.M. on January 5th.

[Illustration: Fig. 73.--Fomalhaut comes to the Meridian, only 17 deg.
from the horizon, at 8 o'clock November 4th.]

In Fig. 73 we recognize the familiar stars of Pegasus, which tell
us we have gone quite round the heavens. Note the beautiful cross
in the Swan. b in the bill is named Albireo, and is a beautiful
double to almost any glass. Its yellow and blue colors are very
distinct. The place of the famous double star 61 Cygni is seen. The
first magnitude star in the lower left-hand corner is Fomalhaut, in
the Southern Fish. a Pegasi is in the diagonal corner from Alpharetz,
in Andromeda. The star below Altair is b Aquilae, and is called
Alschain; the one above is g Aquilae, named Tarazed. This is not
a brilliant section of the sky. Altair rises at 9 o'clock on the
29th of May, and at 6 o'clock A.M. on the 11th of January.

[Page 208]
[Illustration: Fig. 74.--Southern Circumpolar Constellations invisible
north of the Equator.]

Fig. 74 gives the stars that are never seen by persons north of
the earth's equator. In the Ship is brilliant Canopus, and the
remarkable variable ae. Below it is the beautiful Southern Cross,
near the pole of the southern heavens. Just below are the two first
magnitude stars Bungala, a, and Achernar, b, of the Centaur. Such
a number of unusually brilliant stars give the southern sky an
unequalled splendor. In the midst of them, as if for contrast,
is the dark hole, called by the sailors the "Coal-sack," where
even the telescope reveals no sign of light. Here, also, are the
two Magellanic clouds, both easily discernible by the naked eye;
the larger two hundred times the apparent size of the moon, lying
between the pole and Canopus, and the other between Achernar and
the pole. The smaller cloud is only one-fourth the size of the
other. Both are mostly resolvable into groups of stars from the
fifth to the fifteenth magnitude.

time, see star-maps at end of the book.

_Characteristics of the Stars._

Such a superficial examination of stars as we have made scarcely
touches the subject. It is as the study of the baptismal register,
where the names were anciently recorded, without any knowledge
of individuals. The heavens signify much more to us than to the
Greeks. We revolve under a dome that investigation has infinitely
enlarged from their estimate. Their little lights were turned by
clumsy machinery, held together by material connections. Our vast
worlds are connected by a force so fine that it seems to pass out
of the realm of the material into that of the spiritual. Animal
ferocity or a human Hercules could image their idea of power. Ours
finds no symbol, but rises to the Almighty. Their heavens were full
of fighting Orions, wild bulls, chained Andromedas, and devouring
monsters. Our heavens are significant of harmony and unity; all
worlds carried by one force, and all harmonized into perfect music.
All their voices blend their various significations into a personal
speaking, which says, "Hast thou not heard that the everlasting
God, the Lord, the creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not,
neither is weary?" There is no searching of his understanding.
Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created all these
things, that brought out their host by number, that calleth them
all by their names in the greatness of his power; for that he is
strong in power not one faileth.

[Page 210]
_Number._

We find about five thousand stars visible to the naked eye in the
whole heavens, both north and south. Of these twenty are of the
first magnitude, sixty-five of the second, two hundred of the third,
four hundred of the fourth, eleven hundred of the fifth, and three
thousand two hundred of the sixth. We think we can easily number
the stars; but train a six-inch telescope on a little section of the
Twins, where six faint stars are visible, and over three thousand
luminous points appear. The seventh magnitude has 13,000 stars;
the eighth, 40,000; the ninth, 142,000. There are 18,000,000 stars
in the zone called the Milky Way. When our eyes are not sensitive
enough to be affected by the light of far-off stars the tastimetre
feels their heat, and tells us the word of their Maker is true--"they
are innumerable."[*]

[Footnote *: _Telescopic Work._--Look at the Hyades and Pleiades
in Taurus. Notice the different colors of stars in them both. Find
the cluster Praesepe in Fig. 70, just a trifle above a point midway
between Procyon and Regulus. It is equally distant from Procyon and
a point a little below Pollux. Sweep along the Milky Way almost
anywhere, and observe the distribution of stars; in some places
perfect crowds, in others more sparsely scattered. Find with the
naked eye the rich cluster in Perseus. Draw a line from Algol to
a of Perseus (Fig. 67); turn at right angles to the right, at a
distance of once and four-tenths the first line a brightness will
be seen. The telescope reveals a gorgeous cluster.]

_Double and Multiple Stars._

If we look up during the summer months nearly overhead at the star
e Lyra, east of Vega (Fig. 72), we shall see with the naked eye
that the star appears a little [Page 211] elongated. Turn your
opera-glass upon it, and two stars appear. Turn a larger telescope
on this double star, and each of the components separate into two.
It is a double double star. We know that if two stars are near in
reality, and not simply apparently so by being in the same line of
sight, they must revolve around a common centre of gravity, or rush
to a common ruin. Eagerly we watch to see if they revolve. A few
years suffice to show them in actual revolution. Nay, the movement
of revolution has been decided before the companion star was
discovered. Sirius has long been known to have a proper motion, such
as it would have if another sun were revolving about it. Even the
direction of the unseen body could always be indicated. In February,
1862, Alvan Clark, artist, poet, and maker of telescopes (which
requires even greater genius than to be both poet and artist),
discovered the companion of Sirius just in its predicted place. As a
matter of fact, one of Mr. Clark's sons saw it first; but their fame
is one. The time of revolution of this pair is fifty years. But one
companion does not meet the conditions of the movements. Here must
also be one or more planets too small or dark to be seen. The double
star x in the Great Bear (see Fig. 70) makes a revolution in
fifty-eight years.

Procyon moves in an orbit which requires the presence of a companion
star, but it has as yet eluded our search. Castor is a double star;
but a third star or planet, as yet undiscovered, is required to
account for its perturbations. Men who discovered Neptune by the
perturbations of Uranus are capable of judging the cause of the
perturbations of suns. We have spoken of [Page 212] the whole orbit
of the earth being invisible from the stars. The nearest star in our
northern hemisphere, 61 Cygni, is a telescopic double star; the
constituent parts of it are forty-five times as far from each other
as the earth is from the sun, yet it takes a large telescope to show
any distance between the stars.[*]

[Footnote *: _Telescopic Work._--Only such work will be laid out
here as can be done by small telescopes of from two to four inch
object-glasses. The numbers in Fig. 75 correspond to those of the
table.

When g Virginis was observed in 1718 by Bradley, the component
parts were 7" asunder. He incidentally remarked in his note-book
that the line of their connection was parallel to the line of the
two stars Spica, or a and d Virginis. By 1840 they were not more
than 1" apart, and the line of their connection greatly changed.
The appearance of the star is given in Fig. 75 (15), commencing
at the left, for the years 1837 '38 '39 '40 '45 '50 '60 and '79.
also a conjectural [Page 213] orbit, placed obliquely, and the
position of the stars at the times mentioned, commencing at the top.
The time of its complete revolution is one hundred and fifty years.

[Illustration: Fig. 75.--Aspects and Revolution of Double Stars.]

The meaning of these double stars is that two or more suns revolve
about their centre of gravity, as the moon and earth about their
centre. If they have planets, as doubtless they have, the movement
is no more complicated than the planets we call satellites of Saturn
revolving about their central body, and also about the sun. Kindle
Saturn and Jupiter to a blaze, or let out their possible light, and
our system would appear a triple star in the distance. Doubtless,
in the far past, before these giant planets were cooled, it so
appeared.

We find some stars double, others triple, quadruple, octuple, and
multiple. It is an extension of the same principles that govern
our system. Some of these suns are so far asunder that they can
swing their Neptunes between them, with less perturbation than
Uranus and Neptune have in ours. Light all our planets, and there
would be a multiple star with more or less suns seen,
[Page 214]
according to the power of the instrument. Perhaps the octuple star
s in Orion differs in no respect from our system, except in the
size and distance of its separate bodies, and less cooling, either
from being younger, or from the larger bodies cooling more slowly.
Suns are of all ages. Infinite variety fills the sky. It is as
preposterous to expect that every system or world should have analogous
circumstances to ours at the present time, as to insist that every
member of a family should be of the same age, and in the same state
of development. There are worlds that have not yet reached the
conditions of habitability by men, and worlds that have passed
these conditions long since. Let them go. There are enough left,
and an infinite number in the course of preparation. Some are fine
and lasting enough to be eternal mansions.

_Colored Stars._

In the cloudy morning we get only red light, but the sun is white.
So Aldebaran and Betelguese may be girt by vapors, that only the
strong red rays can pass. Again, an iron moderately heated gives
out dull red light; becoming hotter, it emits white light. Sirius,
Regulus, Vega, and Spica may be white from greater intensity of
vibration. Procyon, Capella, and Polaris are yellow from less intensity
of vibration. Again, burn salt in a white flame, and it turns to
yellow; mix alcohol and boracic acid, ignite them, and a beautiful
green flame results; alcohol and nitrate of strontia give red flame;
alcohol and nitrate of barytes give yellow flame. So the composition
of a sun, or the special development of anyone substance thereof
at any time, may determine the color of a star.

[Page 215]
The special glory of color in the stars is seen in the marked contrasts
presented in the double and multiple stars. The larger star is
usually white, still in the intensity of heat and vibration; the
others, smaller, are somewhat cooled off, and hence present colors
lower down the scale of vibration, as green, yellow, orange, and
even red.

That stars should change color is most natural. Many causes would
produce this effect. The ancients said Sirius was red. It is now
white. The change that would most naturally follow mere age and
cooling would be from white, through various colors, to red. We are
charmed with the variegated flowers of our gardens of earth, but
he who makes the fields blush with flowers under the warm kisses of
the sun has planted his wider gardens of space with colored stars.
"The rainbow flowers of the footstool, and the starry flowers of
the throne," proclaim one being as the author of them all.

_Clusters of Stars._

From double and multiple we naturally come to groups and clusters.
Allusion has been made to the Hyades, Pleiades, etc. Everyone has
noticed the Milky Way. It seems like two irregular streams of compacted
stars. It is not supposed that they are necessarily nearer together
than the stars in the sparse regions about the pole. But the 18,000,000
suns belonging to our system are arranged within a space represented
by a flattened disk. If one hundred lights, three inches apart,
are arranged on a hoop ten feet in diameter, they would be in a
circle. Add a thousand or two more the same distance apart, filling
up the centre, and [Page 216] extending a few inches on each side of
the inner plane of the hoop: an eye in the centre, looking out
toward the edge, would see a milky way of lights; looking out toward
the sides or poles, would see comparatively few. It would seem as if
this oblate spheroidal arrangement was the result of a revolution of
all the suns composing the system. Jupiter and earth are flattened
at the poles for the same reason.

[Illustration: Fig. 76.--Sprayed Cluster below ae in Hercules.]

[Illustration: Fig. 77.--Globular Cluster.]

In various parts of the heavens there are small globular well-defined
clusters, and clusters very irregular in form, marked with sprays
of stars. There is a cluster of this latter class in Hercules,
just under the S, in Fig. 72. "Probably no one ever saw it with a
good telescope without a shout of wonder." Here is a cluster of the
former class represented in Fig. 77. "The noble globular cluster,
o Centauri is beyond all comparison the richest and largest object
of the kind in the heavens. Its stars are literally innumerable;
and as their total light, when received by the naked eye, affects
it hardly more than a star of the fifth to fourth
[Page 217]
magnitude, the minuteness of each star may be imagined."
