CHAPTER I.  CONIC SECTION.

It was just after that happy visit of which I told at the end of "What
Katy Did," that Elsie and John made their famous excursion to Conic
Section; an excursion which neither of them ever forgot, and about
which the family teased them for a long time afterward.

The summer had been cool; but, as often happens after cool summers,
the autumn proved unusually hot.  It seemed as if the months had been
playing a game, and had "changed places" all round; and as if September
were determined to show that he knew how to make himself just as
disagreeable as August, if only he chose to do so.  All the last half
of Cousin Helen's stay, the weather was excessively sultry.  She felt
it very much, though the children did all they could to make her
comfortable, with shaded rooms, and iced water, and fans.  Every
evening the boys would wheel her sofa out on the porch, in hopes of
coolness; but it was of no use: the evenings were as warm as the days,
and the yellow dust hanging in the air made the sunshine look thick
and hot.  A few bright leaves appeared on the trees, but they were
wrinkled, and of an ugly color.  Clover said she thought they had been
_boiled_ red like lobsters.  Altogether, the month was a trying one,
and the coming of October made little difference: still the dust
continued, and the heat; and the wind, when it blew, had no refreshment
in it, but seemed to have passed over some great furnace which had
burned out of it all life and flavor.

In spite of this, however it was wonderful to see how Katy gained and
improved.  Every day added to her powers.  First she came down to
dinner, then to breakfast.  She sat on the porch in the afternoons;
she poured the tea.  It was like a miracle to the others, in the
beginning, to watch her going about the house;  but they got used
to it surprisingly soon,--one does to pleasant things.  One person,
however, never got used to it, never took it as a matter of course;
and that was Katy herself.  She could not run downstairs, or out into
the garden; she could not open the kitchen door to give an order,
without a sense of gladness and exultation which was beyond words.
The wider and more active life stimulated her in every way.  Her
cheeks grew round and pink, her eyes bright.  Cousin Helen and papa
watched this change with indescribable pleasure; and Mrs. Worrett,
who dropped in to lunch one day, fairly screamed with surprise at
the sight of it.

"To think of it!" she cried, "why, the last time I was here you looked
as if you had took root in that chair of yours for the rest of your
days, and here you are stepping around as lively as I be.  Well, well!
wonders will never cease.  It does my eyes good to see you, Katherine.
I wish your poor aunt were here to-day; that I do.  How pleased she'd
be?"

It is doubtful whether Aunt Izzie would have been so pleased, for the
lived-in look of the best parlor would have horrified her extremely;
but Katy did not recollect that just then.  She was touched at the
genuine kindness of Mrs. Worrett's voice, and took very willingly
her offered kiss.  Clover brought lemonade and grapes, and they all
devoted themselves to making the poor lady comfortable.  Just before
she went away she said,

"How is it that I can't never get any of you to come out to the Conic
Section?  I'm sure I've asked you often enough.  There's Elsie, now,
and John, they're just the age to enjoy being in the country.  Why
won't you send 'em out for a week?  Johnnie can feed chickens, and
chase 'em, too, if she likes," she added, as Johnnie dashed just then
into view, pursuing one of Phil's bantams round the house.  "Tell her
so, won't you, Katherine?  There is lots of chickens on the farm.  She
can chase 'em from morning to night, if she's a mind to."

Katy thanked her, but she didn't think the children would care to go.
She gave Johnnie the message, and then the whole matter passed out of
her mind.  The family were in low spirits that morning because of
Cousin Helen's having just gone away; and Elsie was lying on the sofa
fanning herself with a great palm-leaf fan.

"Oh, dear!" she sighed.  "Do you suppose it's every going to be cool
again?  It does seem as if I couldn't bear it any longer."

"Aren't you well, darling?" inquired Katy, anxiously.

"Oh, yes! well enough," replied Elsie.  "It's only this horrid heat,
and never going away to where it's cooler.  I keep thinking about the
country, and wishing I were there feeling the wind blow.  I wonder
if papa wouldn't let John and me go to Conic Section, and see Mrs.
Worrett.  Do you think he would, if you asked him?"

"But," said Katy, amazed, "Conic Section isn't exactly country, you
know.  It is just out of the city,--only six miles from here.  And
Mrs. Worrett's house is close to the road, papa said.  Do you think
you'd like it, dear?  It _can't_ be very much cooler than this."

"Oh, yes! it can," rejoined Elsie, in a tone which was a little fretful.
"It's _always_ cooler on a farm.  There's more room for the wind, and--
oh, every thing's pleasanter!  You can't think how tired I am of this
hot house.  Last night I hardly slept at all; and, when I did, I
dreamed that I was a loaf of brown bread, and Debby was putting me
into the oven to bake.  It was a horrid dream.  I was so glad to wake
up.  Won't you ask papa if we may go, Katy?"

"Why, of course I will, if you wish it so much.  Only"--Katy stopped
and did not finish her sentence.  A vision of fat Mrs. Worrett had
risen before her, and she could not help doubting if Elsie would find
the farm as pleasant as she expected.  But sometimes the truest
kindness is in giving people their own unwise way, and Elsie's eyes
looked so wistful that Katy had no heart to argue or refuse.

Dr. Carr looked doubtful when the plan was proposed to him.

"It's too hot," he said.  "I don't believe the girls will like it."

"Oh, yes! we will, papa; indeed we will," pleaded Elsie and John, who
had lingered near the door to learn the fate of their request.

Dr. Carr smiled at the imploring faces, but he looked a little
quizzical.  "Very well," he said, "you may go.  Mr. Worrett is coming
into town to-morrow, on some bank business.  I'll send word by him;
and in the afternoon, when it is cooler, Alexander can drive you out."

"Goody!  Goody!" cried John, jumping up and down, while Elsie put her
arms round papa's neck and gave him a hug.

"And Thursday I'll send for you," he continued.

"But, papa," expostulated Elsie, "That's only two days.  Mrs. Worrett
said a week."

"Yes, she said a week," chimed in John; "and she's got ever so many
chickens, and I'm to feed 'em, and chase 'em as much as I like.  Only
it's too hot to run much," she added reflectively.

"You won't really send for us on Thursday, will you, papa?" urged
Elsie, anxiously.  "I'd like to stay ever and ever so long; but Mrs.
Worrett said a week."

"I shall send on Thursday," repeated Dr. Carr, in a decided tone.
Then, seeing that Elsie's lip was trembling, and her eyes were full
of tears, he continued: "Don't look so woeful, Pussy.  Alexander shall
drive out for you; but if you want to stay longer, you may send him
back with a note to say what day you would like to have him come
again.  Will that do?"

"Oh, yes!" said Elsie, wiping her eyes; "that will do beautifully,
papa.  Only, it seems such a pity that Alexander should have to go
twice when it's so hot; for we're perfectly sure to want to stay
a week."

Papa only laughed, as he kissed her.  All being settled the children
began to get ready.  It was quite an excitement packing the bags, and
deciding what to take and what not to take.  Elsie grew bright and gay
with the bustle.  Just to think of being in the country,--the cool
green country,--made her perfectly happy, she declared.  The truth
was, she was a little feverish and not quite well, and didn't know
exactly how she felt or what she wanted.

The drive out was pleasant, except that Alexander upset John's gravity,
and hurt Elsie's dignity very much, by inquiring, as they left the
gate, "Do the little misses know where it is that they want to go?"
Part of the way the road ran through woods.  They were rather boggy
woods; but the dense shade kept off the sun, and there was a spicy
smell of evergreens and sweet fern.  Elsie felt that the good time
had fairly begun and her spirits rose with every turn of the wheels.

By and by they left the woods, and came out again into the sunshine.
The road was dusty, and so were the fields, and the ragged sheaves
of corn-stalks, which dotted them here and there, looked dusty too.
Piles of dusty red apples lay on the grass, under the orchard trees.
Some cows going down a lane toward their milking shed, mooed in a
dispirited and thirsty way, which made the children feel thirsty also.

"I want a drink of water awfully," said John.  "Do you suppose it's
much farther?  How long will it be before we get to Mrs. Worrett's,
Alexander?"

"'Most there, miss," replied Alexander, laconically.

Elsie put her head out of the carriage, and looked eagerly round.
Where was the delightful farm?  She saw a big, pumpkin-colored house
by the roadside, a little farther on; but surely that couldn't be
it.  Yes: Alexander drew up at the gate, and jumped down to lift.
them out.  It really was!  The surprise quite took away her breath.

She looked about.  There were the woods, to be sure, but half a mile
away across the fields.  Near the house, there were no trees at all;
only some lilac bushes at one side; there was no green grass either.
A gravel path took up the whole of the narrow front yard; and, what
with the blazing color of the paint and the wide-awake look of the
blindless windows, the house had somehow the air of standing on
tip-toe and staring hard at something,--the dust in the road,
perhaps; for there seemed to be nothing to stare at.

Elsie's heart sank indescribably, as she and John got very slowly out
of the carryall, and Alexander, putting his arm over the fence, rapped
loudly at the front door.  It was some minutes before the rap was
answered.  Then a heavy step was heard creaking through the hall, and
somebody began fumbling at an obstinate bolt, which would not move.
Next, a voice which they recognized as Mrs. Worrett's called:
"Isaphiny, Isaphiny, come and see if you can open this door."

"How funny!"  whispered Johnnie, beginning to giggle.

"Isaphiny" seemed to be upstairs; for presently they heard her running
down, after which a fresh rattle began at the obstinate bolt.  But still
the door did not open, and at length Mrs. Worrett put her lips to the
keyhole, and asked,--

"Who is it?"

The voice sounded so hollow and ghostly, that Elsie jumped, as she
answered: "It's I, Mrs. Worrett,--Elsie Carr.  And Johnnie's here,
too."

"Ts, ts, ts!" sounded from within, and then came a whispering; after
which Mrs. Worrett put her mouth again to the keyhole, and called out:
"Go round to the back, children.  I can't make this door open anyway.
It's swelled up with the damp."

"Damp!" whispered Johnnie; "why, it hasn't rained since the third week
in August; papa said so yesterday."

"That's nothing, Miss Johnnie," put in Alexander, overhearing her.
"Folks hereaway don't open their front doors much,--only for weddings
and funerals and such like.  Very likely this has stood shut these
five years.  I know the last time I drove Miss Carr out, before she
died, it was just so; and she had to go round to the back, as you're
a-doing now."
