combustion into the same compounds as the carbohydrates. They rouse the
appetite, stimulate digestion, and finally form carbonates in combination
with the alkalies, thus increasing the alkalinity of the blood. The chief
vegetable acids are: malic acid, in the apple, pear, cherry, &c.; citric
acid, in the lemon, lime, orange, gooseberry, cranberry, strawberry,
raspberry, &c.; tartaric acid, in the grape, pineapple, &c.

Some place these under Class III. or food adjuncts. Oxalic acid (except
when in the insoluble state of calcium oxalate), and several other acids
are poisonous.

Proteids or Albuminoids are frequently termed flesh-formers. They are
composed of nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and a small quantity of
sulphur, and are extremely complex bodies. Their chief function is to form
flesh in the body; but without previously forming it, they may be
transformed into fat or merely give rise to heat. They form the essential
part of every living cell.

Proteids are excreted from the body as water, carbon dioxide, urea, uric
acid, sulphates, &c.

The principal proteids of animal origin have their corresponding proteids
in the vegetable kingdom. Some kinds, whether of animal or vegetable
origin, are more easily digested than others. They have the same
physiological value from whichever kingdom they are derived.

The Osseids comprise ossein, gelatin, cartilage, &c., from bone, skin,
and connective issue. They approach the proteids in composition, but
unlike them they cannot form flesh or fulfil the same purpose in
nutrition. Some food chemists wish to call the osseids, albuminoids; what
were formerly termed albuminoids to be always spoken of as proteids only.

Jellies are of little use as food; not only is this because of the low
nutritive value of gelatin, but also on account of the small quantity
which is mixed with a large proportion of water.

The Vegetable Kingdom is the prime source of all organic food; water,
and to a slight extent salts, form the only food that animals can derive
directly from the inorganic kingdom. When man consumes animal food--a
sheep for example--he is only consuming a portion of the food which that
sheep obtained from grass, clover, turnips, &c. All the proteids of the
flesh once existed as proteids in the vegetables; some in exactly the same
chemical form.

Flesh contains no starch or sugar, but a small quantity of glycogen. The
fat in an animal is derived from the carbohydrates, the fats and the
proteids of the vegetables consumed. The soil that produced the herbage,
grain and roots consumed by cattle, in most cases could have produced food
capable of direct utilisation by man. By passing the product of the soil
through animals there is an enormous economic loss, as the greater part of
that food is dissipated in maintaining the life and growth; little remains
as flesh when the animal is delivered into the hands of the butcher. Some
imagine that flesh food is more easily converted into flesh and blood in
our bodies and is consequently more valuable than similar constituents in
vegetables, but such is not the case. Fat, whether from flesh or from
vegetables is digested in the same manner. The proteids of flesh, like
those of vegetables, are converted into peptone by the digestive
juices--taking the form of a perfectly diffusible liquid--otherwise they
could not be absorbed and utilised by the body. Thus the products of
digestion of both animal and vegetable proteids and fats are the same.
Formerly, proteid matter was looked upon as the most valuable part of the
food, and a large proportion was thought necessary for hard work. It was
thought to be required, not only for the construction of the muscle
substance, but to be utilised in proportion to muscular exertion. These
views are now known to be wrong. A comparatively small quantity of proteid
matter, such as is easily obtained from vegetable food, is ample for the
general needs of the body. Increased muscular exertion requires but a
slight increase of this food constituent. It is the carbohydrates, or
carbohydrates and fats that should be eaten in larger quantity, as these
are the main source of muscular energy. The fact that animals, capable of
the most prolonged and powerful exertion, thrive on vegetables of
comparatively low proteid value, and that millions of the strongest races
have subsisted on what most Englishmen would consider a meagre vegetarian
diet, should have been sufficient evidence against the earlier view.

A comparison of flesh and vegetable food, shows in flesh an excessive
quantity of proteid matter, a very small quantity of glycogen (the animal
equivalent of starch and sugar) and a variable quantity of fat. Vegetable
food differs much, but as a rule it contains a much smaller quantity of
proteid matter, a large proportion of starch and sugar and a small
quantity of fat. Some vegetable foods, particularly nuts, contain much
fat.

Investigation of the digestive processes has shown that the carbohydrates
and fats entail little strain on the system; their ultimate products are
water and carbon dioxide, which are easily disposed of. The changes which
the proteids undergo in the body are very complicated. There is ample
provision in the body for their digestion, metabolism, and final
rejection, when taken in moderate quantity, as is the case in a dietary of
vegetables. The proteids in the human body, after fulfilling their
purpose, are in part expelled in the same way as the carbohydrates; but
the principal part, including all the nitrogen, is expelled by the kidneys
in the form of urea (a very soluble substance), and a small quantity of
uric acid in the form of quadurates.

There is reciprocity between the teeth and digestive organs of animals and
their natural food. The grasses, leaves, &c., which are consumed by the
herbivora, contain a large proportion of cellulose and woody tissue.
Consequently, the food is bulky; it is but slowly disintegrated and the
nutritious matter liberated and digested. The cellulose appears but
slightly acted upon by the digestive juices. The herbivora possess
capacious stomachs and the intestines are very long. The carnivora have
simpler digestive organs and short intestines. Even they consume
substances which leave much indigestible residue, such as skin, ligaments
and bones, but civilised man, when living on a flesh dietary removes as
much of such things as possible. The monkeys, apes, and man (comprised in
the order _Primates_) have a digestive canal intermediate in complexity
and in length to the herbivora and carnivora. A certain quantity of
indigestible matter is necessary for exciting peristaltic action of the
bowels. The carnivora with their short intestinal canal need the least,
the frugivora more, and the herbivora a much larger quantity. The
consumption by man of what is commonly called concentrated food is the
cause of the constipation to which flesh-eating nations are subject. Most
of the pills and other nostrums which are used in enormous quantities
contain aloes or other drugs which stimulate the action of the intestines.

Highly manufactured foods, from which as much as possible of the
non-nutritious matter has been removed is often advocated, generally by
those interested in its sale. Such food would be advantageous only if it
were possible to remove or modify a great part of our digestive canal (we
are omitting from consideration certain diseased conditions, when such
foods may be useful). The eminent physiologist and bacteriologist, Elie
Metchnikoff, has given it as his opinion that much of man's digestive
organs is not only useless but often productive of derangement and
disease. In several cases where it has been necessary, in consequence of
serious disease, to remove the entire stomach or a large part of the
intestines, the digestive functions have been perfectly performed. It is
not that our organs are at fault, but our habits of life differ from that
of our progenitors. In past times, when a simple dietary in which flesh
food formed little or no part, and to-day, in those countries where one
wholly or nearly all derived from vegetable sources and simply prepared is
the rule, diseases of the digestive organs are rare. The Englishman going
to a tropical country and partaking largely of flesh and alcohol, suffers
from disease of the liver and other organs, to which the natives and the
few of his own countrymen, living in accordance with natural laws are
strangers.

Indigestible Matter--Food is never entirely digested. As a reason
against confining ourselves solely to vegetable food, it has been stated
that such is less perfectly digested than animal food and that it
therefore throws more work on the digestive organs. It is also urged that
on this account a greater quantity of vegetable food is required. We have
shown elsewhere that, on the contrary, vegetarians are satisfied with a
smaller amount of food. Man requires a small quantity of woody fibre or
cellulose in his food to stimulate intestinal action and prevent
constipation.

It is difficult to determine how much of a food is unassimilated in the
body. This is for the reason of the intestinal refuse consisting not only
of undigested food, but also of residues of the digestive juices, mucus
and epithelial debris. These latter have been shown to amount to from
one-third to one-half of the whole of the faeces, which is much more than
had previously been supposed.

John Goodfellow has shown that of very coarse wholemeal bread quite 14 per
cent. was undigested, whilst bread made from ordinary grade wholemeal
showed 12.5 per cent. Such a method of analysis was adopted as it was
believed would exclude other than the food waste. The experiments were
made on a person who was eating nothing but the bread. It seems probable
that a smaller proportion would have remained unassimilated had the bread
not formed the sole food. It is advisable that wheatmeal he ground as
finely as possible, the coarse is not only to a less extent assimilated
but apt to irritate the bowels. Notwithstanding that fine white bread gave
only 4.2 per cent. and a coarse white bread 4.9 per cent. of waste, a fine
wheatmeal bread is more economical as the same quantity of wheat produces
a greater weight of flour richer in proteid and mineral matter. From a
large number of experiments with man, it has been calculated that of
proteids there is digested when animal food is eaten 98 per cent., from
cereals and sugars 8 per cent., from vegetables and fruits 80 per cent.
The difference between the proportions digested of the other food
constituents was much less. Although there is here a theoretical advantage
in favour of animal food, there are other considerations of far more
importance than a little undigestible waste. The main question is one of
health. In some dietary experiments of a girl aged 7, living upon a fruit
diet, of whom we have given some particulars elsewhere, Professor Jaffa
gives the following particulars. During the ten days trial the percentages
absorbed were proteids 82.5, fat 86.9, nitrogen free extract 96, crude
fibre 80, ash 5.7, heat of combustion in calories 86.7. He says,
"generally speaking, the food was quite thoroughly assimilated, the
coefficients of digestibility being about the same as are found in an
ordinary mixed diet. It is interesting to note that 80 per cent. of the
crude fibre appeared to be digested. The results of a number of foreign
experiments on the digestibility of crude fibre by man are from 30 to 91.4
per cent., the former value being from mixed wheat and rye, and the latter
in a diet made of rice, vegetables and meat."

NOTES ON THE TABLE OF ANALYSIS.--Under calories are shown kilo-calories
per pound of food. In the analysis marked U the crude fibre or cellulose
is included with the carbo-hydrate, the figures being those given in
Atwater's table. He has found that from 30 to 91 per cent. of the crude
fibre was digested, according to the kind of food. The term fibre or
cellulose in analytical tables is not a very definite one. It depends upon
the details of the method of analysis. In the analyses other than U, the
cellulose is excluded in calculating the calories. Nutrient ratio is the
proportion of the sum of the carbo-hydrate and fat, compared with the
proteid as 1. The fat has first been multiplied by 2.225 to bring it to
the same nutrient value as the carbo-hydrate.

U indicates that the analyses are taken from the United States Department
of Agriculture Experimental Station, Bulletin 28, the tests being chiefly
made by Dr. W.O. Atwater, or under his direction. They are average
analyses of several samples. The refuse consists of such parts as are
rejected in preparing the food; the outer leaves, skin, stalk, seeds, &c.,
of vegetables; the shell of eggs; the bone, &c., of meat. E, indicates
that the edible portion only of the food has been analysed, and under
refuse, in brackets, is shown the quantity rejected before the analysis
was made.

There is considerable variation in the same kind of food, according to the
variety of seed and conditions of growth &c., especially is this the case
with wheat and flour; whenever it has been possible the average of the
analyses of many samples have been given. The method of analysis has not
always been uniform, frequently the cellulose is included with the
carbo-hydrates, and the proteid sometimes includes a very appreciable
quantity of non-proteid nitrogenous matter. This is the case in the
analysis of the mushrooms. G.--Analyses are by John Goodfellow; it will be
noticed that the wheatmeal bread is not made from the same flour as the
whole-meal. D.--B. Dyer, average of 19 fine and coarse oatmeals. S, from
U.S. Cons. Reports, 1899. C.--A.H. Church. The walnut kernels are in the
dried condition as purchased; originally of the same composition as shewn
in the fresh kernels. C.D.--Cavendish or Figi variety of banana, analysis
by D.W.M. Doherty, N.S. Wales. P.--A. Petermann, U.S. Cons. Banana flour,
_musca paradisiaca_ variety. This is widely used in Central America. The
flour is from the unripe fruit, and contains starch 45.7 per cent.; on
ripening the starch is converted into sugar. K.--Konig, mean of 90
analysis. Milk:--Average of many thousand analyses of the pure.
Butter.--Made without salt. L, from the "Lancet," 1903, I, p. 72. Oysters
at 2/6 per dozen. The 8.09 per cent. includes 0.91 glycogen (animal
starch). The shell was of course excluded, also the liquid in the shell.
Apples.--The refuse includes seeds, skin, &c., and such edible portion as
is wasted in cutting them away; the analysis was made on the rest.

Cookery.--Flesh is easier to digest raw. A few, on the advice of their
doctors, eat minced raw flesh, raw beef juice and even fresh warm blood.
Such practice is abhorrent to every person of refinement. Cooking lessens
the offensive appearance and qualities of flesh and changes the flavour;
thorough cooking also destroys any parasites that may be present. Raw
flesh is more stimulating to the animal passions, and excites ferocity in
both man and animals. If the old argument was valid, that as flesh is much
nearer in composition and quality to our own flesh and tissues, it is
therefore our best food, we do wrong in coagulating the albuminoids,
hardening the muscle substance and scorching it by cooking.

Fruits when ripe and in good condition are best eaten raw; cooking spoils
the flavour. Food requiring mastication and encouraging insalivation is
the best. Food is frequently made too sloppy or liquid, and is eaten too
hot, thus favouring indigestion and decay of the teeth. The cereals and
pulses can only with difficulty be eaten raw. When cooked in water the
starch granules swell and break up, the plant cells are ruptured, the
fibres are separated and the nutritious matter rendered easy of digestion.
The flavour is greatly improved. Cooking increases our range and variety
of food. The civilised races use it to excess and over-season their
dishes, favouring over-eating.

If baking powders are used they should only be of the best makes. They
should be composed of sodium bicarbonate and tartaric acid, in such
correct proportions that upon the addition of water only sodium tartrate
and carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) should result. Some powders contain an
excess of sodium bicarbonate. Self-raising flours should be avoided. They
are commonly composed of--in addition to sodium bicarbonate--acid calcium
phosphate, calcium superphosphate and calcium sulphate. Common baking
powders often consist of the same ingredients, and sometimes also of
magnesia and alum. These are often made and sold by ignorant men, whose
sole object is to make money. Calcium superphosphate and acid calcium
phosphate very frequently contain arsenic, and as the cheap commercial
qualities are often used there is danger in this direction. A good formula
for baking powder is, tartaric acid 8 ozs., sodium bicarbonate 9 ozs.,
rice flour 10 to 20 ozs. The last is added to baking powders to improve
the keeping quality and to add bulk. The ingredients must be first
carefully dried, the sodium bicarbonate at not too high a temperature or
it decomposes, and then thoroughly mixed; this must be preserved in well
closed and dry bottles. Another formula, which is slow rising and well
adapted for pastry, is sodium bicarbonate 4 ozs., cream of tartar 9 ozs.,
rice flour about 14 ozs. Custard powders consist of starch, colouring and
flavouring. Egg powders are similar to baking powders but contain yellow
colouring. Little objection can be taken to them if they are coloured with
saffron; turmeric would do if it were not that it gives a slightly
unpleasant taste. Artificial colouring matters or coal tar derivatives are
much used, several of these are distinctly poisonous.

Drinks.--It is better not to drink during eating, or insalivation may be
interfered with; a drink is better taken at the end of a meal. The
practice of washing down food with hot tea is bad. The refreshing nature
of a cup of hot tea, coffee, or cocoa is to a very great extent due to the
