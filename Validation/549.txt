           The first mele here offered as an accompaniment to this hula
           can boast of no great antiquity; it belongs to the middle of
           the nineteenth century, and was the product of some gallant
           at a time when princes and princesses abounded in Hawaii:


                       _Mele_

                Aole i manao ia.
                Kahi wai a o Alekoki.
                Hookohu ka ua i uka,
                Noho mai la i Nuuanu.

                           _Song_

                I spurn the thought with disdain
                Of that pool Alekoki:
                On the upland lingers the rain
                And fondly haunts Nuuanu.
            5   Sharp was the cold, bootless
                My waiting up there.
                I thought thou wert true,
                Wert loyal to me,
                Whom thou laids't under bonds.
           10   Take oath now and keep it;
                This body is sacred to thee,
                Bound by the word of thy mouth.
                My heart leaps up at thought
                Of the pool, pool of Kapena;
           15   To me it is fenced, shut off,
                The water-heads tightly sealed up.
                The fountains must be a-hoarding,
                For skies are ever down-pouring;
                The while I am lodged up aloft,
           20   Bestowed in the cleft of a rock.
                Now, tossed by sea at Mamala,
                The wind drives wildly the surf;
                I'm soaked with the scud of the ocean,
                My body is rough with the rime.
           25   But one stout hero and soldier,
                With heart to face such a storm.
                Wild scud the clouds,
                Hurled by the tempest,
                A tale-bearing wind,
           30   That gossips afar.
                The darkness and storm
                Are nothing to me.
                This way and that am I turning,
                Climbing the hill Ma'e-ma'e,
           35   To look on thy charms, dear one,
                The fragrant buds of the mountain.
                What perfume breathes from thy body,
                Such time as to thee I come close,
                My scarlet bloom of lehua
           40   Yields nectar sought by the birds.


           This mele is said to have been the production of Prince
[Page 110] William Lunalilo--afterward King of the Hawaiian islands--and
           to have been addressed to the Princess Victoria Kamamalu,
           whom he sought in marriage. Both of them inherited high chief
           rank, and their offspring, according to Hawaiian usage, would
           have outranked her brothers, kings Kamehameha IV and V.
           Selfish and political considerations, therefore, forbade the
           match, and thereby hangs a tale, the shadow of which darkens
           this song. Every lover is one part poet; and Lunalilo, even
           without the love-flame, was more than one part poet.

           The poem shows the influence of foreign ways and teachings
           and the pressure of the new environment that had entered
           Hawaii, in its form, in the moderation of its language and
           imagery, and in the coherence of its parts; at the same time
           the spirit of the song and the color of its native imagery
           mark it as the product of a Polynesian mind.

           According to the author's interpretation of the song,
           _Alekoki_ (verse 2), a name applied to a portion of the
           Nuuanu stream lower down than the basin and falls of _Kapena_
           (_Kahiwai a o Kapena_--verse 14), symbolizes a flame that may
           once have warmed the singer's imagination, but which he
           discards in favor of his new love, the pool of Kapena. The
           rain, which prefers to linger in the upland regions of Nuuanu
           (verses 3 and 4) and which often reaches not the lower
           levels, typifies his brooding affection. The cold, the storm,
           and the tempest that rage at _Mamala_ (verse 21)--a name
           given to the ocean just outside Honolulu harbor--and that
           fill the heavens with driving scud (verses 27 and 28)
           represent the violent opposition in high quarters to the
           love-match. The tale-bearing wind, _makani ahai-lono_ (verse
           29), refers, no doubt, to the storm of scandal. The use of
           the place-names _Ma'ema'e_ and _Mauna-ala_ seem to indicate
           Nuuanu as the residence of the princess.

                Playest fan with the breadfruit tree?
            5   Here sprawl Hala-lii's canes,
                There stands bird-haunted Lehua.

                           CANTO II

                My wreath-maker dwells at Waimea.
                Partnered is she to the swirling river;
                They plant with flowers the sandy lea,
           10   While the bearded surf, tossed by the breeze,
                Vaunts on the hills as the sun-bow,
                Looks on the crystal stream Makaweli,
                And in the wildwood makes her abode
                With Hinahina of silvern wreaths.
           15   Koaea's a speck to the eye,
                Under the low-hanging rain-cloud,
                Woodland home of the plaintive o-o.

                From frost-bitten Pa-ie-ie
                I bid you, guess me the fable:
           20   Paddle-maker on Pele's mount.

           This mele comes from Kauai, an Island in many respects
           individualized from the other parts of the group and that
           seems to have been the nurse of a more delicate imagination
           than was wont to flourish elsewhere. Its tone is archaic, and
           it has the rare merit of not transfusing the more crudely
           erotic human emotions into the romantic sentiments inspired
           by nature.

           The Hawaiians dearly loved fable and allegory. Argument or
           truth, dressed out in such fanciful garb, gained double force
           and acceptance. We may not be able to follow a poet in his
           wanderings; his local allusions may obscure to us much of his
           meaning; the doctrine of his allegory may be to us largely a
           riddle; and the connection between the body of its thought
           and illustration and the application, or solution, of the
           poetical conundrum may be past our comprehension; but the
[Page 112] play of the poet's fancy, whether childish or mature, is an
           interesting study, and brings us closer in human sympathy to
           the people who took pleasure in such things.

           In translating this poem, while not following literally the
           language of the poet, the aim has been to hit the target
           of his deeper meaning, without hopelessly involving the
           reader in the complexities of Hawaiian color and local
           topography. A few words of explanation must suffice.

           The _Makani Inu-wai_ (verse 1)--known to all the islands--is
           a wind that dries up vegetation, literally a water-drinking
           wind.

           The _Naulu_ (verse 3) is the ordinary sea-breeze at Waimea,
           Kauai, sometimes accompanied by showers.

           _Hala-li'i_ (verse 5) is a sandy plain on Niihau, and the
           peculiarity of its canes is that they sprawl along on the
           ground, and are often to a considerable extent covered by the
           loose soil.

           _Lehua_ (verse 6) is the well-known bird-island, lying north
           of Niihau and visible from the Waimea side of Kauai.

           The wreath-maker, _haku-lei_ (verse 7), who dwells at Waimea,
           is perhaps the ocean-vapor, or the moist sea-breeze, or, it
           may be, some figment of the poet's imagination--the author
           can not make out exactly what.

           The _hinahina_ (verse 14), a native geranium, is a mountain
           shrub that stands about 3 feet high, with silver-gray leaves.

           _Maka-weli, Maka-li'i, Koae'a_, and _Pa-ie-ie_ are names of
           places on Kauai.

           _Puu-ka-Pele_ (verse 20) as the name indicates, is a volcanic
           hill, situated near Waimea.

           The key or answer (_puana_), to the allegory given in verse
           20, _Ke kahuna kalai-hoe o Puu-ka-Pele_, the paddle-making
           kahuna of Pele's mount, when declared by the poet
           (_haku-mele_), is not very informing to the foreign mind; but
           to the Hawaiian auditor it, no doubt, took the place of our
           _haec fabula docet_, and it at least showed that the poet was
           not without an intelligent motive. In the poem in point the
           author acknowledges his inability to make connection between
           it and the body of the song.

           One merit we must concede to Hawaiian poetry, it wastes no
           time in slow approach. The first stroke of the artist places
           the auditor _in medias res_.

                             XIV.--THE HULA PUILI


           The character of a hula was determined to some extent by the
           nature of the musical instrument that was its accompaniment.
           In the hula _puili_ it certainly seems as if one could
           discern the influence of the rude, but effective, instrument
           that was its musical adjunct. This instrument, the _puili_
           (fig. 1), consisted of a section of bamboo from which one
           node with its diaphragm had been removed and the hollow
           joint at that end split up for a considerable distance into
           fine divisions, which gave forth a breezy rustling when the
           instrument was struck or shaken.

           The performers, all of them hoopaa, were often placed in two
           rows, seated or kneeling and facing one another, thus
           favoring a responsive action in the use of the puili as well
           as in the cantillation of the song. One division would
           sometimes shake and brandish their instruments, while the
           others remained quiet, or both divisions would perform at
           once, each individual clashing one puili against the other
           one held by himself, or against that of his vis-a-vis; or
           they might toss them back and forth to each other, one bamboo
           passing another in mid air.

           [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Puili, bamboo-rattle.]

           While the hula puili is undeniably a performance of classical
           antiquity, it is not to be regarded as of great dignity or
           importance as compared with many other hulas. Its character,
           like that of the meles associated with it, is light and
           trivial.

           The mele next presented is by no means a modern production.
           It seems to be the work of some unknown author, a fragment of
           folklore, it might be called by some, that has drifted down
           to the present generation and then been put to service in the
           hula. If hitherto the word _folklore_ has not been used it is
           not from any prejudice against it, but rather from a feeling
           that there exists an inclination to stretch the application
           of it beyond its true limits and to make it include popular
           songs, stories, myths, and the like, regardless of its
           fitness of application. Some writers, no doubt, would apply
           this vague term to a large part of the poetical pieces which
           are given in this book.
[Page 114]
           On the same principle, why should they not apply the term
           folklore to the myths and stories that make up the body of
           Roman and Greek mythology? The present author reserves the
           term folklore for application to those unappropriated scraps
           of popular song, story, myth, and superstition that have
           drifted down the stream of antiquity and that reach us in the
           scrap-bag of popular memory, often bearing in their battered
           forms the evidence of long use.

                                 _Song_

                It has come, it has come; lo the Sun!
                How I love the Sun that's on high;
                Below it swims Ka-wai-hoa,
                Oa the slope inclined from Lehua.
            5   On Kauai met I a pali,
                A beetling cliff that bounds Milo-lii,
                And climbing up Makua-iki,
                Crawling up was Pua, the child,
                An orphan that weeps out its tale.

           The writer has rescued the following fragment from the
           wastebasket of Hawaiian song. A lean-to of modern verse has
           been omitted; it was evidently added within a generation:

                            _Mele_

                Malua,[250] ki'i wai ke aloha,

                Kuhi no paha oe no Hopoe[252]

           a lehua tree in full bloom.]

                             _Song_

                Malua, fetch water of love,
                Give drink to this mamane bud.
                The birds, they are singing ecstatic,
                Sipping Panaewa's nectared lehua,
            5   Beside themselves with the fragrance
                Exhaled from the garden Ohele.
                Your love comes to me a tornado;
                It has rapt away my whole body,
                The heart you once sealed as your own,
           10   There planted the seed of desire.
                Thought you 'twas the tree of Hopoe,
                This tree, whose bloom you would pluck?

           What is the argument of this poem? A passion-stricken swain,
           or perhaps a woman, cries to _Malua_ to bring relief to his
           love-smart, to give drink to the parched _mamane_
           buds--emblems of human feeling. In contrast to his own
           distress, he points to the birds caroling in the trees,
           reveling in the nectar of _lehua_ bloom, intoxicated with the
           scent of nature's garden. What answer does the lovelorn swain
           receive from the nymph he adores? In lines 11 and 12 she
           banteringly asks him if he took her to be like the
           traditional lehua tree of Hopoe, of which men stood in awe as
           a sort of divinity, not daring to pluck its flowers? It is as
           if the woman had asked--if the poet's meaning is rightly
           interpreted--"Did you really think me plighted to vestal
           vows, a tree whose bloom man was forbidden to pluck?"

                             XV.--THE HULA KA-LAAU


           The hula _ka-laau_ (_ka_, to strike; _laau_, wood) was named
           from the instruments of wood used in producing the
           accompaniment, a sort of xylophone, in which one piece of
           resonant wood was struck against another. Both divisions of
           the performers, the hoopaa and the olapa, took part and each
           division was provided with the instruments. The cantillation
           was done sometimes by one division alone, sometimes by both
           divisions in unison, or one division would answer the other,
           a responsive chanting that was termed _haawe aku, haawe
           mai_--"to give, to return."

           Ellis gives a quotable description of this hula, which he
           calls the "hura ka raau:"

           Five musicians advanced first, each, with a staff in his left
           hand, five or six feet long, about three or four inches in
           diameter at one end, and tapering off to a point at the
           other. In his right hand he held a small stick of hard wood,
           six or nine inches long, with which he commenced his music by
           striking the small stick on the larger one, beating time all
           the while with his right foot on a stone placed on the ground
           beside him for that purpose. Six women, fantastically dressed
           in yellow tapas, crowned, with garlands of flowers, having
           also wreaths of native manufacture, of the sweet-scented
           flowers of the _gardenia_, on their necks, and branches of
           the fragrant _mairi_ (another native plant,) bound round
           their ankles, now made their way by couples through the
           crowd, and, arriving at the area, on one side of which the
           musicians stood, began their dance. Their movements were
           slow, and, though not always graceful, exhibited nothing
           offensive to modest propriety. Both musicians and dancers
           alternately chanted songs in honor of former gods and chiefs
           of the islands, apparently much to the gratification of the
           spectators. (Polynesian Researches, by William Ellis, IV,
           78-79, London, 1836.)

           The mele here first presented is said to be an ancient mele
           that has been modified and adapted to the glorification of
           that astute politician, genial companion, and pleasure-loving
           king, Kalakaua.

           It was not an uncommon thing for one chief to appropriate the
           _mele inoa_ of another chief. By substituting one name for
           another, by changing a genealogy, or some such trifle, the
           skin of the lion, so to speak, could be made to cover with
           more or less grace and to serve as an apparel of masquerade
           for the ass, and without interruption so long as there was no
           lion, or lion's whelp, to do the unmasking.

           The poets who composed the mele for a king have been spoken
           of as "the king's washtubs." Mele inoa were not crown-jewels
[Page 117] to be passed from one incumbent of the throne to another. The
           practice of appropriating the mele inoa composed in honor of
           another king and of another line was one that grew up with
           the decadence of honor in times of degeneracy.

                O Kalakaua, be inoa,

                E a mai ke alii kia-manu;

                      [Translation]

                          Song

                Ka-la-kaua, a great name,
                A flower not wilted by the sun;
                It blooms on the mountains,
                In the forests of Mauna-kea;
            5   It burns in Ki-lau-e-a,
                Illumines the cliff Wahine-kapu,
                The heights of Uwe-kabuna,
                The sacred pali of Ka-au-e-a.
                Shine forth, king of bird-hunters,
           10   Resplendent in plumage of mamo,
                Bright flower of Hawaii:
                Ka-la-kaua, the Illustrious!

           The proper names _Wahine-kapu, Uwe-kahuna_, and _Ka-au-e-a_
           in the sixth, seventh, and eighth verses are localities,
           cliffs, bluffs, precipices, etc., in and about the great
           caldera of Kilauea, following up the mention (in the fifth
           verse) of that giant among the world's active volcanoes.

           The purpose of the poem seems to be to magnify the prowess of
           this once famous king as a captivator of the hearts and
           loving attentions of the fair sex.

           weather-sign.]

           [Footnote 254: The word _na-u_ refers to a sportive contest
           involving a trial of lung-power, that was practised by the
           youth of Kona, Hawaii, as well as of other places. They stood
           on the shore at sunset, and as the lower limb of the sun
           touched the ocean horizon each one, having filled his lungs
           to the utmost, began the utterance of the sound _na-u-u-u-u_,
           which he must, according to the rules of the game, maintain
           continuously until the sun had disappeared, a lapse of about
           two minutes' time. This must be done without taking fresh
           breath. Anyone inhaling more air into his lungs or
           intermitting the utterance of the sound was compelled by the
           umpire to withdraw from the contest and to sit down, while
           anyone who maintained the droning utterance during the
           prescribed time was declared victor. It was no mean trial.]

                The cloud-piles o'er Kona's sea whet my joy,
                Clouds that drop fain in fair weather.
                The clustered dew-pearls shake to the ground;
                The boys drone out the na-u to the West,
            5   Eager for Sol to sink to his rest.

                This my day for a plunge in the sea--
                The Sun will be warming other shores--
                Happy the tribes of that land of calm!
