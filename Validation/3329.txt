you."

"I hope some day," Jack said, "that I shall be able to talk to you
without the aid of an interpreter. It is very difficult to speak when
every word has to be translated."

For a quarter of an hour the conversation was continued, the count and
countess asking questions about England. At the end of that time Jack
thought he might venture to take his leave. The count accompanied him to
the door, and begged him to consider his house as his own, and then with
many bows on each side Jack made his way into the street.

"Confound all this Spanish politeness!" he muttered to himself; "it's
very grand and stately, I have no doubt, but it's a horrible nuisance;
and as to talking through an interpreter, it's like repeating lessons,
only worse. I should like to see a man making a joke through an
interpreter, and waiting to see how it told. I must get up a little
Spanish as soon as possible. The earl has picked up a lot already, and
there will be no fun to be had here in Spain unless one can make one's
self understood."

The next day there were rumors current that the population were
determined to take vengeance upon Velasco. The earl marched eight
hundred men into the town, placed the governor in their center and
escorted him to the shore, and so took him safely on board a ship. He
was conveyed, by his own desire, to Alicante, as the revolt had spread
so rapidly through Catalonia that Rosas was now the only town which
favored the cause of the Duke d'Anjou.

The capture of Barcelona takes its place as one of the most brilliant
feats in military history, and reflects extraordinary credit upon its
general, who exhibited at once profound prudence, faithful adherence
to his sovereign's orders, patience and self command under the ill
concealed hatred of many of those with whom he had to cooperate--the
wrong headedness of the king, the insolence of the German courtiers, the
supineness of the Dutch, the jealousy of his own officers, and the open
discontent of the army and navy--and a secrecy marvelously kept up for
many weary and apparently hopeless days.

On the 28th of October King Charles made his public entry into
Barcelona, and for some days the city was the scene of continual fetes.
The whole province rose in his favor, and the gentlemen of the district
poured into the town to offer their homage to the king. Only about one
thousand men of the Spanish garrison had to be conveyed to Rosas in
accordance with the terms of capitulation, the rest of the troops taking
the oath of allegiance to King Charles and being incorporated with the
allied army.

Jack Stilwell entered into the festivities with the enjoyment of youth.
The officers of the allied army were made much of by the inhabitants,
and Jack, as one of the general's aides de camp, was invited to every
fete and festivity. The Count de Minas introduced him to many of
the leading nobles of the city as the preserver of his life; but his
inability to speak the language deprived him of much of the pleasure
which he would otherwise have obtained, and, like many of the other
officers, he set to work in earnest to acquire some knowledge of it.
In one of the convents were some Scottish monks, and for three or four
hours every morning Jack worked regularly with one of them.

Although Lord Peterborough threw himself heart and soul into the
festivities, he worked with equal ardor at the military preparations.
But here, as before, his plans for energetic action were thwarted by
the Germans and Dutch. At last, however, his energy, aided by the
active spirit of the king, prevailed, and preparations were made for
the continuance of the campaign. The season was so late that no further
operations could be undertaken by sea, and the allied fleet therefore
sailed for England and Holland, leaving four English and two Dutch
frigates in support of the land forces at Barcelona.

Garrisons of regular troops were dispatched to the various towns which
had either declared for the king or had been captured by the Miquelets
headed by the Marquis of Cifuentes, engineer officers being also sent to
put them in a state of defense. Of these Tortosa was, from its position,
the most important, as it commanded the bridge of boats on the Ebro, the
main communication between Aragon and Valencia. To this town two hundred
dragoons and one thousand foot were sent under Colonel Hans Hamilton.
The king turned his attention to the organization of the Spanish
army. He formed a regiment of five hundred dragoons for his bodyguard,
mounting them upon the horses of the former garrison, while from these
troops, swelled by levies from the province, he raised six powerful
battalions of infantry. He excited, however, a very unfavorable feeling
among the Spaniards by bestowing all the chief commands in these corps
upon his German followers.

But while the conquest of Barcelona had brought the whole of Catalonia
to his side, the cause of King Charles was in other parts of Spain less
flourishing. Lord Galway and General Fagel had been beaten by Marshal
Tesse before Badajos, and the allied army had retreated into Portugal,
leaving the French and Spanish adherents of Philip free to turn their
whole attention against the allies in Catalonia.

Weary weeks passed on before Lord Peterborough could overcome the apathy
and obstinacy of the Germans and Dutch. At a council of war held on the
30th of December Peterborough proposed to divide the army, that he in
person would lead half of it to aid the insurrection which had broken
out in Valencia, and that the other half should march into Aragon; but
Brigadier General Conyngham and the Dutch General Schratenbach strongly
opposed this bold counsel, urging that the troops required repose after
their labors, and that their numbers were hardly sufficient to guard
the province they had won. Such arguments drove Peterborough almost to
madness; the troops had, in fact, gone through no hard work during the
siege of Barcelona, and two months and a half had elapsed since that
city surrendered. Moreover, far from being reinvigorated from rest,
they were suffering from illness caused by inactivity in an unhealthy
country.

Already all the benefits derivable from the gallant capture of Barcelona
had been lost. The enemy had recovered from the surprise and dismay
excited by that event. The friendly and wavering, who would at once
have risen had the king boldly advanced after his striking success, had
already lost heart and become dispirited by the want of energy displayed
in his after proceedings, and from all parts of Spain masses of troops
were moving to crush the allies and stamp out the insurrection.

In Valencia only had the partisans of Charles gained considerable
advantages. In the beginning of December Colonel Nebot, commanding a
regiment of Philip's dragoons, declared for Charles, and, accompanied by
four hundred of his men, entered the town of Denia, where the people and
Basset, the governor, at once declared for Charles.

On the 11th Nebot and Basset attacked the little town of Xabea,
garrisoned by five hundred Biscayans, and carried it, and the same night
took Oliva and Gandia. The next day they pushed on through Alzira, where
they were joined by many of the principal inhabitants, and a detachment
of the dragoons under Nebot's brother, Alexander, surprised and routed
three troops of the enemy's horse, captured their convoy of ammunition,
and pursued them to the very gates of Valencia.

On the night of the 15th the main body marched from Alzira, and appeared
next morning before Valencia and summoned the town to surrender. The
Marquis de Villa Garcia refused, but Alexander Nebot put himself at the
head of his dragoons and galloped up to the gates shouting "Long live
the king!" The inhabitants overpowered the guard at the gate and threw
it open and Valencia was taken. When the news of these reverses reached
Madrid the Conde de las Torres, a veteran officer who had seen much
service in the wars of Italy, marched from Madrid in all haste to
prevent if possible the junction of the forces of Catalonia with the
Valencians.

He at once marched upon San Matteo, which lay on the main line of
communication, and commenced a vigorous siege of that city. The king
received the news on the 18th of January, 1706, and wrote at once to
Peterborough, urging him to go to the relief of San Matteo, but
giving him no troops whatever to assist him in his enterprise; and
Peterborough's difficulties were increased by General Conyngham, who
commanded a brigade at Fraga, hastily falling back upon Lerida upon
hearing exaggerated rumors of the strength of the enemy.

Peterborough, however, did not hesitate a moment, but mounting his
horse, and accompanied only by his aides de camp, Jack Stilwell and
Lieutenant Graham, rode for Tortosa. Changing his horse at the various
towns through which he passed, and riding almost night and day, he
reached Tortosa on the 4th, and at once summoned the magnates of the
town to give information as to the real state of things. He then found,
to his astonishment, that the details which the king had sent him
respecting the force of the enemy were entirely incorrect. Charles had
written that they were two thousand strong, and that sixteen thousand
peasants were in arms against them, whereas Las Torres had with him
seven thousand good troops, and not a single peasant had taken up arms.

General Killigrew, who now commanded the two hundred dragoons and
the thousand British infantry at Tortosa, together with his officers,
considered that under such circumstances it was absolutely hopeless to
attempt any movement for the relief of San Matteo; but Peterborough did
not hesitate a moment, and only said to his officers:

"Unless I can raise that siege our affairs are desperate, and therefore
capable only of desperate remedies. Be content; let me try my fortune,
whether I cannot by diligence and surprise effect that which by
downright force is apparently impracticable."

The officers had unbounded confidence in their general, and although
the enterprise appeared absolutely hopeless, they at once agreed to
undertake it. Accordingly the three weak English regiments marched from
Tortosa under Killigrew, and the next day the earl followed with the
dragoons and a party of Miquelets, and overtook the infantry that night.
The next morning he broke up his little army into small detachments in
order that they might march more rapidly, and, dividing the Miquelets
among them as guides, ordered them to assemble at Fraiguesa, two leagues
from San Matteo.

The advance was admirably managed. Small parties of dragoons and
Miquelets went on ahead along each of the roads to occupy the passes
among the hills. When arrived at these points they had strict orders
to let no one pass them until the troops appeared in sight, when the
advance again pushed forward and secured another position for the same
purpose.

Thus no indication of his coming preceded him; and the troops arriving
together with admirable punctuality before Fraiguesa, the place was
taken by surprise, and guards were at once mounted on its gates, with
orders to prevent any one from leaving the town on any excuse whatever.
Thus while the English force were within two leagues of San Matteo,
Las Torres remained in absolute ignorance that any hostile force was
advancing against him. Graham and Jack were nearly worn out by the
exertions which they had undergone with their indefatigable general.
They had ridden for three days and nights almost without sleep, and on
their arrival at Tortosa were engaged unceasingly in carrying out their
chief's instructions, in making preparations for the advance, and in
obtaining every possible information as to the country to be traversed.

Both the young officers had now begun to speak Spanish. A residence of
four months in the country, constant communication with the natives, and
two months and a half steady work with an instructor had enabled them
to make great progress, and they were now able to communicate without
difficulty with the Spaniards with whom they came in contact.



CHAPTER IX: THE ADVANCE INTO VALENCIA


The Earl of Peterborough had not satisfied himself with depriving the
enemy of all information as to his advance. He took steps to confuse and
alarm them by false news. By means of large bribes he prevailed upon two
peasants to carry each a copy of the same letter to Colonel Jones, who
commanded in San Matteo. He took the further step of insuring their
loyalty by arresting their families as hostages, and, moreover, took
care that they should know nothing as to the real state of things that
they could report if treacherously inclined.

He arranged that one of them should go in first and, passing through the
besiegers' lines, should arouse their suspicions, and should then, when
arrested, give up the letter concealed upon him, and should also betray
the route by which his companion was endeavoring to reach the city,
so that the second messenger would also be captured and his letter be
taken. The letters were as follows:

"To COLONEL JONES: You will hardly believe yourself what this letter
informs you of, if it come safe to you; and though I have taken the best
precaution, it will do little prejudice if it falls into the enemy's
hands, since they shall see and feel my troops almost as soon as they
can receive intelligence, should it be betrayed to them. The end for
which I venture it to you is that you may prepare to open the furthest
gate toward Valencia, and have four thousand Miquelets ready, who
will have the employment they love and are fit for, the pursuing and
pillaging a flying enemy. The country is as one can wish for their
entire destruction. Be sure, upon the first appearance of our troops and
the first discharge of our artillery, you answer with an English halloo,
and take to the mountains on the heights with all your men. The Conde
de las Torres must take the plains, the hills on the left being almost
impassable, and secured by five or six thousand of the country people.
But what will gall him most will be the whole regiment of Nebot, which
revolted to us near Valencia, is likewise among us.

"I was eight days ago myself in Barcelona, and I believe the Conde de
las Torres must have so good intelligence from thence that he cannot be
ignorant of it. What belongs to my own troops and my own resolutions
I can easily keep from them, though nothing else. You know the force I
have, and the multitudes that are gathering from all parts against us,
so I am forced to put the whole into this action, which must be decided
to give any hopes to our desperate game. By nine or ten, within an hour
after you can receive this, you will discover us on the tops of the
hills, not two cannon shot from their camp.

"The advantages of the sea are inconceivable, and have contributed to
bring about what you could never expect to see, a force almost equal
to the enemy in number, and you know that less would do our business.
Besides, never men were so transported as to be brought in such secrecy
so near an enemy. I have near six thousand men locked up this night
within the walls of Traguera. I do not expect you will believe it till
you see them.

"You know we had a thousand foot and two hundred dragoons in Tortosa.
Wills and a thousand foot English and Dutch came down the Ebro in boats,
and I embarked a thousand more at Tarragona when I landed at Vinaroz,
and the artillery from thence I brought in country carts. It was easy
to assemble the horse. Zinzendorf and Moras are as good as our own,
and with our English dragoons make up in all near two thousand. But the
whole depends upon leaving them a retreat without interruption.

"Dear Jones, prove a good dragoon, be diligent and alert, and preach the
welcome doctrine to your Miquelets, plunder without danger.

"Your friend, PETERBOROUGH."

The two letters fell into the hands of Las Torres, and so artfully had
the capture been contrived, that it never occurred to him to doubt the
truth of these mendacious documents. Orders were instantly given to
prepare for a march, and almost at the same time two events occurred in
the siege works which caused confusion of the troops. Several mines had
been unskillfully sunk and charged; one of these prematurely exploded
and destroyed forty of the workmen. The remaining mines Colonel Jones
contrived to swamp by turning the course of a brook into them, thus
rendering them harmless. While the troops were confused with these
disasters, the news of the contents of the intercepted letters spread
through the camp, causing a general panic; and almost immediately
afterward the advance guard of Peterborough's force were seen, according
to the promise contained in the letters, on the crests of the hills.

By able management the twelve hundred men were made to appear vastly
more numerous than they were. The dragoons showed in various parties
at different points of the hilltops, and, after pausing as if to
reconnoiter the camp, galloped back as if to carry information to a main
body behind; while the infantry availed themselves of the wooded and
uneven ground to conceal their weakness. It seemed, indeed, to the enemy
that the tops of all the hills and the avenues of approach were covered
by advancing columns. Las Torres, unsuspicious of stratagem, was now
convinced that his position was one of extreme danger, while confusion
reigned in the camp. The tents were hastily struck, the guns spiked, and
in a few minutes the Spanish army started along the Valencia road in a
retreat which might almost be called a flight.

Colonel Jones, seeing the confusion that reigned, instantly sallied from
the town with his whole force in pursuit, and followed Las Torres for
nearly two leagues to Penasol, inflicting a loss of nearly three hundred
men upon the Spaniards; while Peterborough on the other side marched his
force through the abandoned intrenchments and into the town. Scarcely
halting, however, he made a show of pursuit as far as Albocazer, but
