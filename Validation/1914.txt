6 Just as I am--thy love unknown
Hath broken every barrier down;
Now to be thine, yea, thine alone,
  O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

     Charlotte Elliott, 1836.


236     Badea. S.M.

_Decision._     (506)

And can I yet delay
  My little all to give?
To tear my soul from earth away,
  For Jesus to receive?

2 Nay, but I yield, I yield,
  I can hold out no more:
I sink, by dying love compelled,
  And own thee conqueror.

3 Tho' late, I all forsake,
  My friends, my all resign;
Gracious Redeemer, take, oh, take,
  And seal me ever thine.

4 Come and possess me whole,
  Nor hence again remove;
Settle and fix my wav'ring soul
  With all thy weight of love.

     Charles Wesley, 1746.


237     I am Listening. 8s & 7s.

_The Call Answered._

Do you hear the Savior calling,
  By the wooings of his voice?
Do you hear the accents falling?
  Will you make the precious choice?

Ref.--I am list'ning; oh, I'm list'ning
        Just to hear the accents fall!
      I am list'ning; oh, I'm list'ning
        To the Savior's gentle call!

2 By his Spirit he is wooing,
  Softly drawing us to him,
Thro' the day and night pursuing,
  With his gentle voice to win.

3 By the Word of Truth he's speaking
  To the wand'ring, erring ones;
List! the voice the stillness breaking!
  Hear the sweet and solemn tones!

4 In his providential dealings,
  Even in his stern decrees,
In the loudest thunders pealing,
  Or the murm'ring of the breeze.

     W. S. Marshall.


238     I Do Believe. C.M.

_Unwearied Earnestness._    (491)

Father, I stretch my hand to thee;
  No other help I know:
If thou withdraw thyself from me,
  Ah! whither shall I go?

Cho.--I do believe, I now believe
        That Jesus died for me;
      And thro' his blood, his precious blood,
        I shall from sin be free.

2 What did thine only Son endure.
  Before I drew my breath?
What pain, what labor, to secure
  My soul from endless death!

3 O Jesus, could I this believe,
  I now should feel thy power;
And all my wants thou would'st relieve,
  In this accepted hour.

4 Author of faith! to thee I lift
  My weary, longing eyes;
Oh, let me now receive that gift--
  My soul without it dies.

5 Surely thou canst not let me die;
  Oh, speak, and I shall live,
And here I will unwearied lie,
  Till thou thy Spirit give.

6 How would my fainting soul rejoice,
  Could I but see thy face;
Now let me hear thy quick'ning voice,
  And taste thy pard'ning grace.

     Charles Wesley


239     I Do Believe. C.M.

_The Friend of Sinners._    (485)

Jesus! thou art the sinner's Friend;
  As such I look to thee;
Now, in the fullness of thy love,
  O Lord! remember me.

2 Remember thy pure word of grace,--
  Remember Calvary;
Remember all thy dying groans,
  And, then, remember me.

3 Thou wondrous Advocate with God!
  I yield myself to thee;
While thou art sitting on thy throne,
  Dear Lord! remember me.

4 Lord! I am guilty--I am vile,
  But thy salvation's free;
Then, in thine all abounding grace,
  Dear Lord! remember me.

     Richard Burnham, 1783, _a._

_Approaching the Mercy-Seat._     (482)

Approach, my soul, the mercy-seat,
  Where Jesus answers prayer;
There humbly fall before his feet,
  For none can perish there.

2 Thy promise is my only plea,
  With this I venture nigh;
Thou call'st the burdened souls to thee,
  And such, O Lord, am I.

3 Bowed down beneath a load of sin,
  By Satan sorely pressed;
By wars without and fears within,
  I come to thee for rest.

4 Oh, wondrous love! to bleed and die,
  To bear the cross and shame;
That guilty sinners, such as I,
  Might plead thy gracious name.

     John Newton, 1779.


241     Take Me As I Am. P.M.

_No Hope in Self._

Jesus, my Lord, to thee I cry;
Unless thou help me, I must die;
Oh, bring thy free salvation nigh
  And take me as I am.

Ref.--Take me as I am,
      Take me as I am;
      Oh, bring thy free salvation nigh,
      And take me as I am.

2 Helpless I am, and full of guilt,
But yet for me thy blood was spilt,
And thou canst make me as thou wilt,
  But take me as I am.

3 I thirst, I long to know thy love,
Thy full salvation I would prove;
But since to thee I cannot move
  Oh, take me as I am.

4 If thou hast work for me to do,
Inspire my will, my heart renew,
And work both in and by me, too,
  But take me as I am.

5 And when at last the work is done.
The battle o'er, the victory won,
Still, still my cry shall be alone,
  Oh, take me as I am.

     Eliza H. Hamilton.


242     Fix Your Eyes Upon Jesus. P.M.

_The Source of Peace._

Would you lose your load of sin?
  Fix your eyes upon Jesus;
Would you know God's peace within?
  Fix your eyes upon Jesus.

Cho.--Jesus who on the cross did die,
      Jesus who lives and reigns on high,
      He alone can justify;
      Fix your eyes upon Jesus.

2 Would you calmly walk the wave?
  Fix your eyes upon Jesus;
Would you know his pow'r to save?
  Fix your eyes upon Jesus.

3 Would you have your cares grow light?
  Fix your eyes upon Jesus;
Would you songs have in the night?
  Fix your eyes upon Jesus.

4 Grieving, would you comfort know?
  Fix your eyes upon Jesus;
Humble be when blessings flow?
  Fix your eyes upon Jesus.

5 Would you strength in weakness have?
  Fix your eyes upon Jesus;
See a light beyond the grave?
  Fix your eyes upon Jesus.

     D. W. Whittle.


243     At the Cross. C.M.

_Rom. 5:2._     (664)

I stand; but not as once I did,
  Beneath my load of guilt;
The blessed Jesus bore it all--
  For me his blood was spilt.

2 I stand; but not on Calvary's Mount,
  With arms around the cross;
I have been there, and left behind
  Earth's pleasures, joys, and dross.

3 I stand e'en now where he appears,
  In union with my Lord;
In him I'm saved, oh, wondrous thought.
  I read it in his word.

4 Oh, bless the Lord! in him alone--
  In him we are complete;
We live by faith! but soon in sight
  Our coming Christ we'll greet.

     Unknown.


244     At the Cross. C.M.

_Salvation at the Cross._    (492)

Oh, wondrous, deep, unbounded love,
  My Savior, can it be
That thou hast borne the crown of thorns
  And suffered death for me?

Cho.--At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the light
        And, the burden of my heart rolled away--
      It was there by faith I received my sight,
        And now I am happy all the day.

2 I kneel, repenting, at thy feet,
  I give myself to thee;
I plead thy merits, thine alone,
  For thou hast died for me.

3 Oh, let me plunge beneath the tide,
  For sinners flowing free,
Then rise, renewed by grace divine,
  And shout salvation free.

4 And when I reach thy place above,
  My sweetest notes will be,
Redemption through a Savior's name,
  Who bled and died for me.

     Fanny Crosby, 1873.


245     Saved by Faith. P.M.

_Justified by Faith._

I have found redemption in the Savior's blood,
  I am saved by faith in his blood, in his blood;
I am sweetly trusting in the word of God
  I am saved by faith in his blood.

Cho.--I am saved, yes, sweetly saved,
      I am saved by faith in the blood he shed for me,
      I am saved, yes, sweetly saved,
      I am saved by faith in his blood.

2 Oh, how sweet the story of his wondrous grace,
I am saved by faith in his blood, in his blood;
I will trust in Jesus while I run my race,
I am saved by faith in his blood.

3 I will sing of Jesus while the days go by,
I am saved by faith in his blood, in his blood;
I will trust his promise, on his strength rely,
I am saved by faith in his blood.

4 I will keep on singing as I march along,
I am saved by faith in his blood, in his blood;
In my home in glory this shall be my song,
I am saved by faith in his blood.


246     Only Trust Him. C.M.

_Peace in Believing._

Come, ev'ry soul by sin oppressed,
  There's mercy with the Lord;
And he will surely give you rest
  By trusting in his word.

Cho.--Only trust him, only trust him,
        Only trust him now;
      He will save you, he will save you,
        He will save you now.

2 For Jesus shed his precious blood
  Rich blessings to bestow;
Plunge now into the crimson flood
  That washes white as snow.

3 Yes, Jesus is the Truth, the Way,
  That leads you into rest;
Believe in him without delay,
  And you are fully blest.

4 Come, then, and join this holy band,
  And on to glory go,
To dwell in that celestial land,
  Where joys immortal flow.

247     Is My Name Written There? P.M.

_The Book of Life._

Lord, I care not for riches,
  Neither silver nor gold;
I would make sure of heaven,
  I would enter the fold.
In the book of thy kingdom,
  With its pages so fair,
Tell me, Jesus, my Savior,
  Is my name written there?

Cho.--Is my name written there?
      On the page white and fair?
      In the book of thy kingdom,
      Is my name written there?

2 Lord, my sins, they are many,
  Like the sands of the sea,
But thy blood, oh, my Savior,
  Is sufficient for me;
For thy promise is written,
  In bright letters that glow,
"Tho' your sins be as scarlet,
  I will make them like snow."

3 Oh, that beautiful city,
  With its mansions of light,
With its glorified beings,
  In pure garments of white;
Where no evil thing cometh
  To despoil what is fair;
Where the angels are watching,
  Yes, my name's written there.

     Mrs. Mary A. Kidder.


248     Convert. P.M.

_Joy in Christ._

  Oh, how happy are they
  Who their Savior obey,
And have laid up their treasures above;
  Tongue cannot express
  The sweet comfort and peace
Of a soul in its earliest love.

2 That sweet comfort was mine,
  When the favor divine
I first found in the blood of the Lamb;
  When my heart it believed,
  What a joy I received,
What a heaven in Jesus' name.

3 'Twas a heaven below
  My Redeemer to know,
And the angels could do nothing more
  Than to fall at his feet,
  And the story repeat,
And the Lover of sinners adore.

4 Jesus, all the day long,
  Was my joy and my song;
O that all his salvation might see!
  He hath loved me, I cried,
  He hath suffered and died
To redeem such a rebel as me.

5 On the wings of his love
  I was carried above
All sin and temptation and pain,
  And I could not believe
  That I ever should grieve--
That I ever should suffer again.

6 I then rode on the sky,
  Freely justified I,
Nor did envy Elijah his seat;
  My soul mounted higher,
  In a chariot of tire,
And the moon it was under my feet.

7 O the rapturous height
  Of that holy delight
Which I felt in the life-giving blood,
  Of my Savior possessed,
  I was perfectly blest,
As if filled with the fullness of God.

8 Never more will I stray
  From my Savior away,
But I'll follow the Lamb till I die;
  I will take up my cross,
  And count all things but loss,
Till I meet with my Lord in the sky.

     Charles Wesley.


249     Hallowed Spot. P.M.

_The Place of Conversion._    (249)

There is a spot to me more dear
  Than native vale or mountain;
A spot to which affection's tear
  Springs grateful from its fountain;
'Tis not where kindred souls abound--
  Tho' that is almost heaven--
But where I first my Savior found,
  And felt my sins forgiven.

2 Hard was my toil to reach the shore,
  Long tossed upon the ocean,
Above me was the thunder's roar,
  Beneath, the wave's commotion.
Darkly the pall of night was thrown
  Around me, faint with terror;
In that dark hour how did my groans
  Ascend for years of error.

3 Sinking and panting as for breath,
  I knew not help was nigh me,
And cried, O save me, Lord, from death--
  Immortal Jesus, hear me.
Then, quick as thought, I felt him mine--
  My Savior stood before me;
I saw his brightness round me shine,
  And shouted glory, glory.

4 O sacred hour, O hallowed spot!
  Where love divine first found me;
Wherever falls my distant lot,
  My heart shall linger round thee:
And as from earth I rise, to soar
  Up to my home in heaven,
Down will I cast my eyes once more,
  Where I was first forgiven.

     William Hunter, D. D.


250     Boylston. S.M.

_The Need of Conversion_

How solemn are the words,
  And yet to faith how plain,
Which Jesus uttered while on earth--
  "Ye must be born again!"

2 "Ye must be born again!"
  For so hath God decreed;
No reformation will suffice--
  'Tis life poor sinners need.

3 "Ye must be born again!"
  And life in Christ must have;
In vain the soul may elsewhere go--
  'Tis he alone can save.

4 "Ye must be born again!"
  Or never enter heaven;
'Tis only blood-washed ones are there--
  The ransomed and forgiven.

     Anon.


251     It is Well with My Soul. P.M.

_The Soul Redeemed._

When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
  When sorrows, like sea-billows, roll;
Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,
  It is well, it is well with my soul.

Cho.--It is well with my soul,
      It is well, it is well with my soul.

2 Tho' Satan should buffet, tho' trials should come,
  Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,
  And hath shed his own blood for my soul.

3 My sin--oh, the bliss of this glorious tho't--
  My sin--not in part but the whole,
Is nailed to his cross and I bear it no more,
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh, my soul!

4 And, Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,
  The clouds be rolled back as a scroll,
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
  "Even so"--it is well with my soul.

     H.G. Spafford.


252     Hallelujah! 'Tis Done. 12s.

_An Accomplished Work._

'Tis the promise of God, full salvation to give
Unto him who on Jesus, his Son, will believe

Cho.--Hallelujah! 'tis done,
      I believe on the Son;
      I am saved by the blood of the crucified One.

2 Tho' the pathway be lonely, and dangerous, too,
Surely Jesus is able to carry me through.

3 Many loved ones have I in yon heavenly throng;
They are safe now in glory, and this is their song:

4 Little children I see standing close by their King,
And he smiles as their song of salvation they sing.

5 There are prophets and kings in that throng I behold,
And they sing as they march thro' the streets of pure gold,

6 There's a part in that chorus for you and for me,
And the theme of our praises forever will be.
