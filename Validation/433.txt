the midrib, and between these extremes all gradations are found. The
larger leaves are traversed by a strong midrib projecting strongly on
the lower side of the leaf, and from this the smaller veins branch.
The upper leaves have frequently two smaller veins starting from the
base of the leaf, and nearly parallel with the midrib (_C_ i). The
surface of the leaves is somewhat roughened with hairs, some of which,
if slightly magnified, look like little white stars.

Magnifying slightly a thin cross-section of the stem, it shows a
central, ground tissue (pith), whose cells are large enough to be seen
even when very slightly enlarged. Surrounding this is a ring of
fibro-vascular bundles (_L_, _fb._), appearing white and opaque, and
connected by a more transparent tissue. Outside of the ring of
fibro-vascular bundles is the green ground tissue and epidermis.
Comparing this with the section of the seedling pine stem, a
resemblance is at once evident, and this arrangement was also noticed
in the stem of the horse-tail.

Branches are given off from the main stem, arising at the point where
the leaves join the stem (axils of the leaves), and these may in turn
branch. All the branches terminate finally in an elongated
inflorescence, and the separate flowers are attached to the main axis
of the inflorescence by short stalks. This form of inflorescence is
known technically as a "raceme." Each flower is really a short branch
from which the floral leaves arise in precisely the same way as the
foliage leaves do from the ordinary branches. There are five sets of
floral leaves: I. four outer perigone leaves (sepals) (_F_), small,
green, pointed leaves traversed by three simple veins, and together
forming the calyx; II. four larger, white, inner perigone leaves
(petals) (_G_), broad and slightly notched at the end, and tapering to
the point of attachment. The petals collectively are known as the
"corolla." The veins of the petals fork once; III. and IV. two sets of
stamens (_E_), the outer containing two short, and the inner, four
longer ones arranged in pairs. Each stamen has a slender filament
(_H_, _f_) and a two-lobed anther (_an._). The innermost set consists
of two carpels united into a compound pistil. The ovary is oblong,
slightly flattened so as to be oval in section, and divided into two
chambers. The style is very short and tipped by a round, flattened
stigma.

The raceme continues to grow for a long time, forming new flowers at
the end, so that all stages of flowers and fruit may often be found in
the same inflorescence.

The flowers are probably quite independent of insect aid in
pollination, as the stamens are so placed as to almost infallibly shed
their pollen upon the stigma. This fact, probably, accounts for the
inconspicuous character of the flowers.

After fertilization is effected, and the outer floral leaves fall off,
the ovary rapidly enlarges, and becomes heart-shaped and much
flattened at right angles to the partition. When ripe, each half falls
away, leaving the seeds attached by delicate stalks (funiculi, sing.
funiculus) to the edges of the membranous partition. The seeds are
small, oval bodies with a shining, yellow-brown shell, and with a
little dent at the end where the stalk is attached. Carefully dividing
the seed lengthwise, or crushing it in water so as to remove the
embryo, we find it occupies the whole cavity of the seed, the young
stalk (_st._) being bent down against the back of one of the
cotyledons (_f_).

  A microscopic examination of a cross-section of the older root shows
  that the central portion is made up of radiating lines of
  thick-walled cells (fibres) interspersed with lines of larger, round
  openings (vessels). There is a ring of small cambium cells around
  this merging into the phloem, which is composed of irregular cells,
  with pretty thick, but soft walls. The ground tissue is composed of
  large, loose cells, which in the older roots are often ruptured and
  partly dried up. The epidermis is usually indistinguishable in the
  older roots. To understand the early structure of the roots, the
  smallest rootlets obtainable should be selected. The smallest are so
  transparent that the tips may be mounted whole in water, and will
  show very satisfactorily the arrangement of the young tissues. The
  tissues do not here arise from a single, apical cell, as we found in
  the pteridophytes, but from a group of cells (the shaded cells in
  Fig. 94, _B_). The end of the root, as in the fern, is covered with
  a root cap (_r_) composed of successive layers of cells cut off from
  the growing point. The rest of the root shows the same division of
  the tissues into the primary epidermis (dermatogen) (_d_), young
  fibro-vascular cylinder (plerome) (_pl._), and young ground tissue
  (periblem) (_pb._). The structure of the older portions of such
  a root is not very easy to study, owing to difficulty in making
  good cross-sections of so small an object. By using a very
  sharp razor, and holding perfectly straight between pieces of pith,
  however, satisfactory sections can be made. The cells contain so
  much starch as to make them almost opaque, and potash should be used
  to clear them. The fibro-vascular bundle is of the radial type,
  there being two masses of xylem (_xy._) joined in the middle, and
  separating the two phloem masses (_ph._), some of whose cells are
  rather thicker walled than the others. The bundle sheath is not so
  plain here as in the fern. The ground tissue is composed of
  comparatively large cells with thickish, soft walls, that contain
  much starch. The epidermis usually dies while the root is still
  young. In the larger roots the early formation of the cambium ring,
  and the irregular arrangement of the tissues derived from its
  growth, soon obliterate all traces of the primitive arrangement of
  the tissues. Making a thin cross-section of the stem, and magnifying
  strongly, we find bounding the section a single row of epidermal
  cells (Fig. 94, _A_, _ep._) whose walls, especially the outer ones,
  are strongly thickened. Within these are several rows of thin-walled
  ground-tissue cells containing numerous small, round chloroplasts.
  The innermost row of these cells (_sh._) are larger and have but
  little chlorophyll. This row of cells forms a sheath around the ring
  of fibro-vascular bundles very much as is the case in the
  horse-tail. The separate bundles are nearly triangular in outline,
  the point turned inward, and are connected with each other by masses
  of fibrous tissue (_f_), whose thickened walls have a peculiar,
  silvery lustre. Just inside of the bundle sheath there is a row of
  similar fibres marking the outer limit of the phloem (_ph._). The
  rest of the phloem is composed of very small cells. The xylem is
  composed of fibrous cells with yellowish walls and numerous large
  vessels (_tr._). The central ground tissue (pith) has large,
  thin-walled cells with numerous intercellular spaces, as in the stem
  of _Erythronium_. Some of these cells contain a few scattered
  chloroplasts in the very thin, protoplasmic layer lining their
  walls, but the cells are almost completely filled with colorless
  cell sap.

  A longitudinal section shows that the epidermal cells are much
  elongated, the cells of the ground tissue less so, and in both the
  partition walls are straight. In the fibrous cells, both of the
  fibro-vascular bundle and those lying between, the end walls are
  strongly oblique. The tracheary tissue of the xylem is made up of
  small, spirally-marked vessels, and larger ones with thickened
  rings or with pits in the walls. The small, spirally-marked vessels
  are nearest the centre, and are the first to be formed in the young
  bundle.

  The epidermis of the leaves is composed of irregular cells with wavy
  outlines like those of the ferns. Breathing pores, of the same type
  as those in the ferns and monocotyledons, are found on both
  surfaces, but more abundant and more perfectly developed on the
  lower surface of the leaf. Owing to their small size they are not
  specially favorable for study. The epidermis is sparingly covered
  with unicellular hairs, some of which are curiously branched, being
  irregularly star-shaped. The walls of these cells are very thick,
  and have little protuberances upon the outer surface (Fig. 93, _E_).

  Cross-sections of the leaf may be made between pith as already
  directed; or, by folding the leaf carefully several times, the whole
  can be easily sectioned. The structure is essentially as in the
  adder-tongue, but the epidermal cells appear more irregular, and the
  fibro-vascular bundles are better developed. They are like those of
  the stem, but somewhat simpler. The xylem lies on the upper side.

  The ground tissue is composed, as in the leaves we have studied, of
  chlorophyll-bearing, loose cells, rather more compact upon the upper
  side. (In the majority of dicotyledons the upper surface of the
  leaves is nearly or quite destitute of breathing pores, and the
  cells of the ground tissue below the upper epidermis are closely
  packed, forming what is called the "palisade-parenchyma" of the
  leaf.)

  The shepherd's-purse is an admirable plant for the study of the
  development of the flower which is much the same in other
  angiosperms. To study this, it is only necessary to teaze out, in a
  drop of water, the tip of a raceme, and putting on a cover glass,
  examine with a power of from fifty to a hundred diameters. In the
  older stages it is best to treat with potash, which will render the
  young flowers quite transparent. The young flower (Fig. 95, _A_) is
  at first a little protuberance composed of perfectly similar small
  cells filled with dense protoplasm. The first of the floral leaves
  to appear are the sepals which very early arise as four little buds
  surrounding the young flower axis (Fig. 95, _A_, _B_). The stamens
  (_C_, _an._) next appear, being at first entirely similar to the
  young sepals. The petals do not appear until the other parts of the
  flower have reached some size, and the first tracheary tissue
  appears in the fibro-vascular bundle of the flower stalk (_D_). The
  carpels are more or less united from the first, and form at first a
  sort of shallow cup with the edges turned in (_D_, _gy._). This cup
  rapidly elongates, and the cavity enlarges, becoming completely
  closed at the top where the short style and stigma develop. The
  ovules arise in two lines on the inner face of each carpel, and the
  tissue which bears them (placenta) grows out into the cavity of the
  ovary until the two placentae meet in the middle and form a partition
  completely across the ovary (Fig. 95, _H_).

  The stamens soon show the differentiation into filament and anther,
  but the former remains very short until immediately before the
  flowers are ready to open. The anther develops four sporangia
  (pollen sacs), the process being very similar to that in such
  pteridophytes as the club mosses. Each sporangium (Fig. _E_, _F_)
  contains a central mass of spore mother cells, and a wall of three
  layers of cells. The spore mother cells finally separate, and the
  inner layer of the wall cells becomes absorbed much as we saw in
  the fern, and the mass of mother cells thus floats free in the
  cavity of the sporangium. Each one now divides in precisely the same
  way as in the ferns and gymnosperms, into four pollen spores. The
  anther opens as described for _Erythronium_.

  By carefully picking to pieces the young ovaries, ovules in all
  stages of development may be found, and on account of their small
  size and transparency, show beautifully their structure. Being
  perfectly transparent, it is only necessary to mount them in water
  and cover.

  The young ovule (_I_, _J_) consists of a central, elongated body
  (nucellus), having a single layer of cells enclosing a large central
  cell (the macrospore or embryo sac) (_sp._). The base of the
  nucellus is surrounded by two circular ridges (i, ii) of which the
  inner is at first higher than the outer one, but later (_K_, _L_),
  the latter grows up above it and completely conceals it as well as
  the nucellus. One side of the ovule grows much faster than the
  other, so that it is completely bent upon itself, and the opening
  between the integuments is brought close to the base of the ovule
  (Fig. 95, _L_). This opening is called the "micropyle," and allows
  the pollen tube to enter.

  The full-grown embryo sac shows the same structure as that already
  described in _Monotropa_ (page 276), but as the walls of the
  full-grown ovule are thicker here, its structure is rather difficult
  to make out. The ripe stigma is covered with little papillae
  (Fig. 95, _F_) that hold the pollen spores which may be found here
  sending out the pollen tube. By carefully opening the ovary and
  slightly crushing it in a drop of water, the pollen tube may
  sometimes be seen growing along the stalk of the ovule until it
  reaches and enters the micropyle.

  To study the embryo a series of young fruits should be selected, and
  the ovules carefully dissected out and mounted in water, to which a
  little caustic potash has been added. The ovule will be thus
  rendered transparent, and by pressing gently on the cover glass with
  a needle so as to flatten the ovule slightly, there is usually no
  trouble in seeing the embryo lying in the upper part of the embryo
  sac, and by pressing more firmly it can often be forced out upon the
  slide. The potash should now be removed as completely as possible
  with blotting paper, and pure water run under the cover glass.

  The fertilized egg cell first secretes a membrane, and then divides
  into a row of cells (_N_) of which the one nearest the micropyle is
  often much enlarged. The cell at the other end next enlarges and
  becomes divided by walls at right angles to each other into eight
  cells. This globular mass of cells, together with the cell next to
  it, is the embryo plant, the row of cells to which it is attached
  taking no further part in the process, and being known as the
  "suspensor." Later the embryo becomes indented above and forms two
  lobes (_Q_), which are the beginnings of the cotyledons. The first
  root and the stem arise from the cells next the suspensor.




CHAPTER XVIII.

CLASSIFICATION OF DICOTYLEDONS.


DIVISION I.--_Choripetalae_.

Nearly all of the dicotyledons may be placed in one of two great
divisions distinguished by the character of the petals. In the first
group, called _Choripetalae_, the petals are separate, or in some
degenerate forms entirely absent. As familiar examples of this group,
we may select the buttercup, rose, pink, and many others.

The second group (_Sympetalae_ or _Gamopetalae_) comprises those
dicotyledons whose flowers have the petals more or less completely
united into a tube. The honeysuckles, mints, huckleberry, lilac, etc.,
are familiar representatives of the _Sympetalae_, which includes the
highest of all plants.

[Illustration: FIG. 96.--Iuliflorae. _A_, male; _B_, female
inflorescence of a willow, _Salix_ (_Amentaceae_), x 1/2. _C_, a single
male flower, x 2. _D_, a female flower, x 2. _E_, cross-section of the
ovary, x 8. _F_, an opening fruit. _G_, single seed with its hairy
appendage, x 2.]

The _Choripetalae_ may be divided into six groups, including twenty-two
orders. The first group is called _Iuliflorae_, and contains numerous,
familiar plants, mostly trees. In these plants, the flowers are small
and inconspicuous, and usually crowded into dense catkins, as in
willows (Fig. 96) and poplars, or in spikes or heads, as in the
lizard-tail (Fig. 97, _G_), or hop (Fig. 97, _I_). The individual
flowers are very small and simple in structure, being often reduced to
the gynoecium or andraecium, carpels and stamens being almost always in
separate flowers. The outer leaves of the flower (sepals and petals)
are either entirely wanting or much reduced, and never differentiated
into calyx and corolla.

inflorescence. _B_, a single male flower, x 3. _C_, section of the

In the willows (Fig. 96) the stamens are bright-colored, so that the
flowers are quite showy, and attract numerous insects which visit them
for pollen and nectar, and serve to carry the pollen to the pistillate
flowers, thus insuring their fertilization. In the majority of the
group, however, the flowers are wind-fertilized. An excellent example
of this is seen in the common hazel (Fig. 97, _A_). The male flowers
are produced in great numbers in drooping catkins at the ends of the
branches, shedding the pollen in early spring before the leaves
unfold. The female flowers are produced on the same branches, but
lower down, and in much smaller numbers. The stigmas are long, and
covered with minute hairs that catch the pollen which is shaken out
in clouds every time the plant is shaken by the wind, and falls in a
shower over the stigmas. A similar arrangement is seen in the oaks,
hickories, and walnuts.

There are three orders of the _Iuliflorae_: _Amentaceae_, _Piperineae_,
and _Urticinae_. The first contains the birches (_Betulaceae_); oaks,
beeches, hazels, etc. (_Cupuliferae_); walnuts and hickories
(_Juglandeae_); willows and poplars (_Salicaceae_). They are all trees
or shrubs; the fruit is often a nut, and the embryo is very large,
completely filling it.

The _Piperineae_ are mostly tropical plants, and include the pepper
plant (_Piper_), as well as other plants with similar properties. Of
our native forms, the only common one is the lizard-tail (_Saururus_),
not uncommon in swampy ground. In these plants, the calyx and corolla
are entirely absent, but the flowers have both carpels and stamens
(Fig. 97, _H_).

The _Urticinae_ include, among our common plants, the nettle family
(_Urticaceae_); plane family (_Plataneae_), represented by the sycamore
or buttonwood (_Platanus_); the hemp family (_Cannabineae_); and the
elm family (_Ulmaceae_). The flowers usually have a calyx, and may
have only stamens or carpels, or both. Sometimes the part of the stem
bearing the flowers may become enlarged and juicy, forming a
fruit-like structure. Well-known examples of this are the fig and
mulberry.

The second group of the _Choripetalae_ is called _Centrospermae_, and
includes but a single order comprising seven families, all of which,
except one (_Nyctagineae_), are represented by numerous native species.
The latter comprises mostly tropical plants, and is represented in our
gardens by the showy "four-o'clock" (_Mirabilis_). In this plant, as
in most of the order, the corolla is absent, but here the calyx is
large and brightly colored, resembling closely the corolla of a
morning-glory or petunia. The stamens are usually more numerous than
the sepals, and the pistil, though composed of several carpels, has,
as a rule, but a single cavity with the ovules arising from the base,
though sometimes the ovary is several celled.
