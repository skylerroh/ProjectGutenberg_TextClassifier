and his rattling bones was man's steady companion. He woke his victims
up with terrible tunes on his scratchy fiddle he sat down with them at
dinner--he smiled at them from behind trees and shrubs when they took
a girl out for a walk. If you had heard nothing but hair-raising yarns
about cemeteries and coffins and fearful diseases when you were very
young, instead of listening to the fairy stories of Anderson and Grimm,
you, too, would have lived all your days in a dread of the final hour
and the gruesome day of Judgment. That is exactly what happened to the
children of the Middle Ages. They moved in a world of devils and spooks
and only a few occasional angels. Sometimes, their fear of the future
filled their souls with humility and piety, but often it influenced them
the other way and made them cruel and sentimental. They would first of
all murder all the women and children of a captured city and then they
would devoutly march to a holy spot and with their hands gory with
the blood of innocent victims, they would pray that a merciful heaven
forgive them their sins. Yea, they would do more than pray, they would
weep bitter tears and would confess themselves the most wicked of
sinners. But the next day, they would once more butcher a camp of
Saracen enemies without a spark of mercy in their hearts.

Of course, the Crusaders were Knights and obeyed a somewhat different
code of manners from the common men. But in such respects the common man
was just the same as his master. He, too, resembled a shy horse, easily
frightened by a shadow or a silly piece of paper, capable of excellent
and faithful service but liable to run away and do terrible damage when
his feverish imagination saw a ghost.

In judging these good people, however, it is wise to remember the
terrible disadvantages under which they lived. They were really
barbarians who posed as civilised people. Charlemagne and Otto the Great
were called "Roman Emperors," but they had as little resemblance to a
real Roman Emperor (say Augustus or Marcus Aurelius) as "King" Wumba
Wumba of the upper Congo has to the highly educated rulers of Sweden or
Denmark. They were savages who lived amidst glorious ruins but who
did not share the benefits of the civilisation which their fathers and
grandfathers had destroyed. They knew nothing. They were ignorant of
almost every fact which a boy of twelve knows to-day. They were obliged
to go to one single book for all their information. That was the Bible.
But those parts of the Bible which have influenced the history of the
human race for the better are those chapters of the New Testament which
teach us the great moral lessons of love, charity and forgiveness. As
a handbook of astronomy, zoology, botany, geometry and all the other
sciences, the venerable book is not entirely reliable. In the twelfth
century, a second book was added to the mediaeval library, the great
encyclopaedia of useful knowledge, compiled by Aristotle, the Greek
philosopher of the fourth century before Christ. Why the Christian
church should have been willing to accord such high honors to the
teacher of Alexander the Great, whereas they condemned all other Greek
philosophers on account of their heathenish doctrines, I really do
not know. But next to the Bible, Aristotle was recognized as the only
reliable teacher whose works could be safely placed into the hands of
true Christians.

His works had reached Europe in a somewhat roundabout way. They had gone
from Greece to Alexandria. They had then been translated from the Greek
into the Arabic language by the Mohammedans who conquered Egypt in the
seventh century. They had followed the Moslem armies into Spain and the
philosophy of the great Stagirite (Aristotle was a native of Stagira in
Macedonia) was taught in the Moorish universities of Cordova. The Arabic
text was then translated into Latin by the Christian students who had
crossed the Pyrenees to get a liberal education and this much travelled
version of the famous books was at last taught at the different schools
of northwestern Europe. It was not very clear, but that made it all the
more interesting.

With the help of the Bible and Aristotle, the most brilliant men of the
Middle Ages now set to work to explain all things between Heaven and
Earth in their relation to the expressed will of God. These brilliant
men, the so-called Scholasts or Schoolmen, were really very intelligent,
but they had obtained their information exclusively from books, and
never from actual observation. If they wanted to lecture on the sturgeon
or on caterpillars, they read the Old and New Testaments and Aristotle,
and told their students everything these good books had to say upon
the subject of caterpillars and sturgeons. They did not go out to the
nearest river to catch a sturgeon. They did not leave their libraries
and repair to the backyard to catch a few caterpillars and look at these
animals and study them in their native haunts. Even such famous scholars
as Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas did not inquire whether the
sturgeons in the land of Palestine and the caterpillars of Macedonia
might not have been different from the sturgeons and the caterpillars of
western Europe.

When occasionally an exceptionally curious person like Roger Bacon
appeared in the council of the learned and began to experiment with
magnifying glasses and funny little telescopes and actually dragged the
sturgen and the caterpillar into the lecturing room and proved that they
were different from the creatures described by the Old Testament and by
Aristotle, the Schoolmen shook their dignified heads. Bacon was going
too far. When he dared to suggest that an hour of actual observation
was worth more than ten years with Aristotle and that the works of that
famous Greek might as well have remained untranslated for all the good
they had ever done, the scholasts went to the police and said, "This man
is a danger to the safety of the state. He wants us to study Greek that
we may read Aristotle in the original. Why should he not be contented
with our Latin-Arabic translation which has satisfied our faithful
people for so many hundred years? Why is he so curious about the insides
of fishes and the insides of insects? He is probably a wicked magician
trying to upset the established order of things by his Black Magic." And
so well did they plead their cause that the frightened guardians of the
peace forbade Bacon to write a single word for more than ten years. When
he resumed his studies he had learned a lesson. He wrote his books in
a queer cipher which made it impossible for his contemporaries to read
them, a trick which became common as the Church became more desperate in
its attempts to prevent people from asking questions which would lead to
doubts and infidelity.

This, however, was not done out of any wicked desire to keep people
ignorant. The feeling which prompted the heretic hunters of that day
was really a very kindly one. They firmly believed--nay, they knew--that
this life was but the preparation for our real existence in the
next world. They felt convinced that too much knowledge made people
uncomfortable, filled their minds with dangerous opinions and led to
doubt and hence to perdition. A mediaeval Schoolman who saw one of
his pupils stray away from the revealed authority of the Bible and
Aristotle, that he might study things for himself, felt as uncomfortable
as a loving mother who sees her young child approach a hot stove. She
knows that he will burn his little fingers if he is allowed to touch it
and she tries to keep him back, if necessary she will use force. But she
really loves the child and if he will only obey her, she will be as good
to him as she possibly can be. In the same way the mediaeval guardians
of people's souls, while they were strict in all matters pertaining to
the Faith, slaved day and night to render the greatest possible service
to the members of their flock. They held out a helping hand whenever
they could and the society of that day shows the influence of thousands
of good men and pious women who tried to make the fate of the average
mortal as bearable as possible.

A serf was a serf and his position would never change. But the Good Lord
of the Middle Ages who allowed the serf to remain a slave all his life
had bestowed an immortal soul upon this humble creature and therefore
he must be protected in his rights, that he might live and die as a good
Christian. When he grew too old or too weak to work he must be
taken care of by the feudal master for whom he had worked. The serf,
therefore, who led a monotonous and dreary life, was never haunted by
fear of to-morrow. He knew that he was "safe"--that he could not be
thrown out of employment, that he would always have a roof over his head
(a leaky roof, perhaps, but roof all the same), and that he would always
have something to eat.

This feeling of "stability" and of "safety" was found in all classes of
society. In the towns the merchants and the artisans established guilds
which assured every member of a steady income. It did not encourage the
ambitious to do better than their neighbours. Too often the guilds
gave protection to the "slacker" who managed to "get by." But they
established a general feeling of content and assurance among the
labouring classes which no longer exists in our day of general
competition. The Middle Ages were familiar with the dangers of what we
modern people call "corners," when a single rich man gets hold of all
the available grain or soap or pickled herring, and then forces the
world to buy from him at his own price. The authorities, therefore,
discouraged wholesale trading and regulated the price at which merchants
were allowed to sell their goods.

The Middle Ages disliked competition. Why compete and fill the world
with hurry and rivalry and a multitude of pushing men, when the Day of
Judgement was near at hand, when riches would count for nothing and
when the good serf would enter the golden gates of Heaven while the bad
knight was sent to do penance in the deepest pit of Inferno?

In short, the people of the Middle Ages were asked to surrender part
of their liberty of thought and action, that they might enjoy greater
safety from poverty of the body and poverty of the soul.

And with a very few exceptions, they did not object. They firmly
believed that they were mere visitors upon this planet--that they were
here to be prepared for a greater and more important life. Deliberately
they turned their backs upon a world which was filled with suffering and
wickedness and injustice. They pulled down the blinds that the rays
of the sun might not distract their attention from that chapter in the
Apocalypse which told them of that heavenly light which was to illumine
their happiness in all eternity. They tried to close their eyes to most
of the joys of the world in which they lived that they might enjoy those
which awaited them in the near future. They accepted life as a necessary
evil and welcomed death as the beginning of a glorious day.

The Greeks and the Romans had never bothered about the future but had
tried to establish their Paradise right here upon this earth. They had
succeeded in making life extremely pleasant for those of their fellow
men who did not happen to be slaves. Then came the other extreme of the
Middle Ages, when man built himself a Paradise beyond the highest clouds
and turned this world into a vale of tears for high and low, for rich
and poor, for the intelligent and the dumb. It was time for the pendulum
to swing back in the other direction, as I shall tell you in my next
chapter.




MEDIAEVAL TRADE

HOW THE CRUSADES ONCE MORE MADE THE MEDITERRANEAN A BUSY CENTRE OF
TRADE AND HOW THE CITIES OF THE ITALIAN PENINSULA BECAME THE GREAT
DISTRIBUTING CENTRE FOR THE COMMERCE WITH ASIA AND AFRICA


THERE were three good reasons why the Italian cities should have been
the first to regain a position of great importance during the late
Middle Ages. The Italian peninsula had been settled by Rome at a very
early date. There had been more roads and more towns and more schools
than anywhere else in Europe.

The barbarians had burned as lustily in Italy as elsewhere, but there
had been so much to destroy that more had been able to survive. In
the second place, the Pope lived in Italy and as the head of a vast
political machine, which owned land and serfs and buildings and forests
and rivers and conducted courts of law, he was in constant receipt of
a great deal of money. The Papal authorities had to be paid in gold and
silver as did the merchants and ship-owners of Venice and Genoa. The
cows and the eggs and the horses and all the other agricultural products
of the north and the west must be changed into actual cash before the
debt could be paid in the distant city of Rome.

This made Italy the one country where there was a comparative abundance
of gold and silver. Finally, during the Crusades, the Italian cities had
become the point of embarkation for the Crusaders and had profiteered to
an almost unbelievable extent.

And after the Crusades had come to an end, these same Italian cities
remained the distributing centres for those Oriental goods upon which
the people of Europe had come to depend during the time they had spent
in the near east.

Of these towns, few were as famous as Venice. Venice was a republic
built upon a mud bank. Thither people from the mainland had fled during
the invasions of the barbarians in the fourth century. Surrounded on all
sides by the sea they had engaged in the business of salt-making. Salt
had been very scarce during the Middle Ages, and the price had been
high. For hundreds of years Venice had enjoyed a monopoly of this
indispensable table commodity (I say indispensable, because people, like
sheep, fall ill unless they get a certain amount of salt in their food).
The people had used this monopoly to increase the power of their city.
At times they had even dared to defy the power of the Popes. The town
had grown rich and had begun to build ships, which engaged in trade
with the Orient. During the Crusades, these ships were used to carry
passengers to the Holy Land, and when the passengers could not pay for
their tickets in cash, they were obliged to help the Venetians who were
for ever increasing their colonies in the AEgean Sea, in Asia Minor and
in Egypt.

By the end of the fourteenth century, the population had grown to two
hundred thousand, which made Venice the biggest city of the Middle Ages.
The people were without influence upon the government which was the
private affair of a small number of rich merchant families. They elected
a senate and a Doge (or Duke), but the actual rulers of the city were
the members of the famous Council of Ten,--who maintained themselves
with the help of a highly organised system of secret service men and
professional murderers, who kept watch upon all citizens and quietly
removed those who might be dangerous to the safety of their high-handed
and unscrupulous Committee of Public Safety.

The other extreme of government, a democracy of very turbulent habits,
was to be found in Florence. This city controlled the main road from
northern Europe to Rome and used the money which it had derived from
this fortunate economic position to engage in manufacturing. The
Florentines tried to follow the example of Athens. Noblemen, priests and
members of the guilds all took part in the discussions of civic affairs.
This led to great civic upheaval. People were forever being divided
into political parties and these parties fought each other with intense
bitterness and exiled their enemies and confiscated their possessions
as soon as they had gained a victory in the council. After several
centuries of this rule by organised mobs, the inevitable happened. A
powerful family made itself master of the city and governed the town and
the surrounding country after the fashion of the old Greek "tyrants."
They were called the Medici. The earliest Medici had been physicians
(medicus is Latin for physician, hence their name), but later they had
turned banker. Their banks and their pawnshops were to be found in all
the more important centres of trade. Even today our American pawn-shops
display the three golden balls which were part of the coat of arms
of the mighty house of the Medici, who became rulers of Florence and
married their daughters to the kings of France and were buried in graves
worthy of a Roman Caesar.

Then there was Genoa, the great rival of Venice, where the merchants
specialised in trade with Tunis in Africa and the grain depots of the
Black Sea. Then there were more than two hundred other cities, some
large and some small, each a perfect commercial unit, all of them
fighting their neighbours and rivals with the undying hatred of
neighbours who are depriving each other of their profits.

Once the products of the Orient and Africa had been brought to these
distributing centres, they must be prepared for the voyage to the west
and the north.

Genoa carried her goods by water to Marseilles, from where they were
reshipped to the cities along the Rhone, which in turn served as the
market places of northern and western France.

Venice used the land route to northern Europe. This ancient road led
across the Brenner pass, the old gateway for the barbarians who had
invaded Italy. Past Innsbruck, the merchandise was carried to Basel.
From there it drifted down the Rhine to the North Sea and England, or it
was taken to Augsburg where the Fugger family (who were both bankers
and manufacturers and who prospered greatly by "shaving" the coins with
which they paid their workmen), looked after the further distribution to
Nuremberg and Leipzig and the cities of the Baltic and to Wisby (on the
Island of Gotland) which looked after the needs of the Northern Baltic
and dealt directly with the Republic of Novgorod, the old commercial
centre of Russia which was destroyed by Ivan the Terrible in the middle
of the sixteenth century.

The little cities on the coast of north-western Europe had an
interesting story of their own. The mediaeval world ate a great deal of
fish. There were many fast days and then people were not permitted to
eat meat. For those who lived away from the coast and from the rivers,
this meant a diet of eggs or nothing at all. But early in the thirteenth
century a Dutch fisherman had discovered a way of curing herring, so
that it could be transported to distant points. The herring fisheries of
the North Sea then became of great importance. But some time during the
thirteenth century, this useful little fish (for reasons of its own)
moved from the North Sea to the Baltic and the cities of that inland
sea began to make money. All the world now sailed to the Baltic to catch
herring and as that fish could only be caught during a few months
each year (the rest of the time it spends in deep water, raising large
families of little herrings) the ships would have been idle during the
rest of the time unless they had found another occupation. They were
then used to carry the wheat of northern and central Russia to southern
and western Europe. On the return voyage they brought spices and silks
and carpets and Oriental rugs from Venice and Genoa to Bruges and
Hamburg and Bremen.

Out of such simple beginnings there developed an important system of
international trade which reached from the manufacturing cities of
Bruges and Ghent (where the almighty guilds fought pitched battles with
the kings of France and England and established a labour tyranny which
completely ruined both the employers and the workmen) to the Republic
of Novgorod in northern Russia, which was a mighty city until Tsar Ivan,
who distrusted all merchants, took the town and killed sixty thousand
people in less than a month's time and reduced the survivors to beggary.

That they might protect themselves against pirates and excessive
tolls and annoying legislation, the merchants of the north founded a
protective league which was called the "Hansa." The Hansa, which had
its headquarters in Lubeck, was a voluntary association of more than
one hundred cities. The association maintained a navy of its own which
patrolled the seas and fought and defeated the Kings of England and
Denmark when they dared to interfere with the rights and the privileges
of the mighty Hanseatic merchants.

I wish that I had more space to tell you some of the wonderful stories
of this strange commerce which was carried on across the high mountains
and across the deep seas amidst such dangers that every voyage became a
glorious adventure. But it would take several volumes and it cannot be
done here.

Besides, I hope that I have told you enough about the Middle Ages to
make you curious to read more in the excellent books of which I shall
give you a list at the end of this volume.

The Middle Ages, as I have tried to show you, had been a period of very
slow progress. The people who were in power believed that "progress"
was a very undesirable invention of the Evil One and ought to be
discouraged, and as they hap-pened to occupy the seats of the mighty, it
was easy to enforce their will upon the patient serfs and the illiterate
knights. Here and there a few brave souls sometimes ventured forth
into the forbidden region of science, but they fared badly and were
considered lucky when they escaped with their lives and a jail sentence
of twenty years.

In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the flood of international
commerce swept over western Europe as the Nile had swept across
the valley of ancient Egypt. It left behind a fertile sediment of
prosperity. Prosperity meant leisure hours and these leisure hours gave
both men and women a chance to buy manuscripts and take an interest in
literature and art and music.

Then once more was the world filled with that divine curiosity which has
elevated man from the ranks of those other mammals who are his distant
cousins but who have remained dumb, and the cities, of whose growth and
development I have told you in my last chapter, offered a safe shelter
to these brave pioneers who dared to leave the very narrow domain of the
established order of things.

They set to work. They opened the windows of their cloistered and
studious cells. A flood of sunlight entered the dusty rooms and
showed them the cobwebs which had gathered during the long period of
semi-darkness.

They began to clean house. Next they cleaned their gardens.

Then they went out into the open fields, outside the crumbling town
walls, and said, "This is a good world. We are glad that we live in it."

At that moment, the Middle Ages came to an end and a new world began.




THE RENAISSANCE

PEOPLE ONCE MORE DARED TO BE HAPPY JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE ALIVE. THEY
TRIED TO SAVE THE REMAINS OF THE OLDER AND MORE AGREEABLE CIVILISATION
OF ROME AND GREECE AND THEY WERE SO PROUD OF THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS THAT
THEY SPOKE OF A RENAISSANCE OR RE-BIRTH OF CIVILISATION


THE Renaissance was not a political or religious movement. It was a
state of mind.

The men of the Renaissance continued to be the obedient sons of the
mother church. They were subjects of kings and emperors and dukes and
murmured not.

But their outlook upon life was changed. They began to wear different
clothes--to speak a different language--to live different lives in
different houses.

They no longer concentrated all their thoughts and their efforts
upon the blessed existence that awaited them in Heaven. They tried to
establish their Paradise upon this planet, and, truth to tell, they
succeeded in a remarkable degree.

I have quite often warned you against the danger that lies in historical
dates. People take them too literally. They think of the Middle Ages as
a period of darkness and ignorance. "Click," says the clock, and the
Renaissance begins and cities and palaces are flooded with the bright
sunlight of an eager intellectual curiosity.

As a matter of fact, it is quite impossible to draw such sharp lines.
The thirteenth century belonged most decidedly to the Middle Ages. All
historians agree upon that. But was it a time of darkness and stagnation
merely? By no means. People were tremendously alive. Great states were
being founded. Large centres of commerce were being developed. High
above the turretted towers of the castle and the peaked roof of the
town-hall, rose the slender spire of the newly built Gothic cathedral.
Everywhere the world was in motion. The high and mighty gentlemen of the
city-hall, who had just become conscious of their own strength (by way
of their recently acquired riches) were struggling for more power with
their feudal masters. The members of the guilds who had just become
aware of the important fact that "numbers count" were fighting the high
and mighty gentlemen of the city-hall. The king and his shrewd advisers
went fishing in these troubled waters and caught many a shining bass
of profit which they proceeded to cook and eat before the noses of the
surprised and disappointed councillors and guild brethren.

To enliven the scenery during the long hours of evening when the badly
lighted streets did not invite further political and economic dispute,
the Troubadours and Minnesingers told their stories and sang their songs
of romance and adventure and heroism and loyalty to all fair women.
Meanwhile youth, impatient of the slowness of progress, flocked to the
universities, and thereby hangs a story.

The Middle Ages were "internationally minded." That sounds difficult,
but wait until I explain it to you. We modern people are "nationally
minded." We are Americans or Englishmen or Frenchmen or Italians and
speak English or French or Italian and go to English and French and
