  Warning us that the day is near.

  When breezes bright of orient morn
  With rosy hues the heavens adorn,
  They cheer with hope of gladdening light
  The hearts that spend in toil their might.

  Though sleep be but a passing guest
  'Tis type of death's perpetual rest:
  Our sins are as a ghastly night,
  And seal with slumbers deep our sight.

  But from the wide roof of the sky
  Christ's voice peals forth with urgent cry,
  Calling our sleep-bound hearts to rise
  And greet the dawn with wakeful eyes.

  He bids us fear lest sensual ease
  Unto life's end the spirit seize
  And in the tomb of shame us bind,
  Till we are to the true light blind.

  'Tis said that baleful spirits roam
  Abroad beneath the dark's vast dome;
  But, when the cock crows, take their flight
  Sudden dispersed in sore affright.

  For the foul votaries of the night
  Abhor the coming of the light,
  And shamed before salvation's grace
  The hosts of darkness hide their face.

  They know the cock doth prophesy
  Of Hope's long-promised morning sky,
  When comes the Majesty Divine
  Upon awakened worlds to shine.

  The Lord to Peter once foretold
  What meaning that shrill strain should hold,
  How he before cock-crow would lie
  And thrice his Master dear deny.

  For 'tis a law that sin is done
  Before the herald of the sun
  To humankind the dawn proclaims
  And with his cry the sinner shames.

  Then wept he bitter tears aghast
  That from his lips the words had passed,
  Though guileless he his soul possessed
  And faith still reigned within his breast.

  Nor ever reckless word he said
  Thereafter, by his tongue betrayed,
  But at the cock's familiar cry
  Humbled he turned from vanity.

  Therefore it is we hold to-day
  That, as the world in stillness lay,
  What hour the cock doth greet the skies,
  Christ from deep Hades did arise.

  Lo! then the bands of death were burst,
  Shattered the sway of hell accurst:
  Then did the Day's superior might
  Swiftly dispel the hosts of Night.

  Now let base deeds to silence fall,
  Black thoughts be stilled beyond recall:
  Now let sin's opiate spell retire
  To that deep sleep it doth inspire.

  For all the hours that still remain
  Until the dark his goal attain,
  Alert for duty's stern command
  Let every soul a sentry stand.

  With sober prayer on Jesus call;
  Let tears with our strong crying fall;
  Sleep cannot on the pure soul steal
  That supplicates with fervent zeal.

  Too long did dull oblivion cloud
  Our motions and our senses shroud:
  Lulled by her numbing touch, we stray
  In dreamland's ineffectual way.

  Bound by the dazzling world's soft chain
  'Tis false and fleeting gauds we gain,
  Like those who in deep slumbers lie:--
  Let us awake! the truth is nigh.

  Gold, honours, pleasure, wealth and ease,
  And all the joys that mortals please,
  Joys with a fatal glamour fraught--
  When morning comes, lo! all are nought.

  But thou, O Christ, put sleep to flight
  And break the iron bands of night,
  Free us from burden of past sin
  And shed Thy morning rays within.




                          II. HYMNUS MATUTINUS


    Nox et tenebrae et nubila,
  confusa mundi et turbida,
  lux intrat, albescit polus,
  Christus venit, discedite.

    Caligo terrae scinditur          5
  percussa solis spiculo,
  rebusque iam color redit
  vultu nitentis sideris.

    Sic nostra mox obscuritas
  fraudisque pectus conscium        10
  ruptis retectum nubibus
  regnante pallescit Deo.

    Tunc non licebit claudere
  quod quisque fuscum cogitat,
  sed mane clarescent novo          15
  secreta mentis prodita.

    Fur ante lucem squalido
  inpune peccat tempore,
  sed lux dolis contraria
  latere furtum non sinit.          20

    Versuta fraus et callida
  amat tenebris obtegi,
  aptamque noctem turpibus
  adulter occultus fovet.

    Sol ecce surgit igneus,         25
  piget, pudescit, paenitet,
  nec teste quisquam lumine
  peccare constanter potest.

    Quis mane sumptis nequiter
  non erubescit poculis,            30
  cum fit libido temperans
  castumque nugator sapit?

    Nunc, nunc severum vivitur,
  nunc nemo tentat ludicrum,
  inepta nunc omnes sua             35
  vultu colorant serio.

    Haec hora cunctis utilis,
  qua quisque, quod studet, gerat,
  miles, togatus, navita,
  opifex, arator, institor.         40

    Illum forensis gloria,
  hunc triste raptat classicum,
  mercator hinc ac rusticus
  avara suspirant lucra.

    At nos lucelli ac faenoris      45
  fandique prorsus nescii,
  nec arte fortes bellica,
  te, Christe, solum novimus.

    Te mente pura et simplici,
  te voce, te cantu pio             50
  rogare curvato genu
  flendo et canendo discimus.

    His nos lucramur quaestibus,
  hac arte tantum vivimus,
  haec inchoamus munera,            55
  cum sol resurgens emicat.

    Intende nostris sensibus,
  vitamque totam dispice,
  sunt multa fucis inlita,
  quae luce purgentur tua.          60

    Durare nos tales iube,
  quales, remotis sordibus
  nitere pridem iusseras,
  Iordane tinctos flumine.

    Quodcumque nox mundi dehinc     65
  infecit atris nubibus,
  tu, rex Eoi sideris,
  vultu sereno inlumina.

    Tu sancte, qui taetram picem
  candore tingis lacteo             70
  ebenoque crystallum facis,
  delicta terge livida.

    Sub nocte Iacob caerula
  luctator audax angeli,
  eo usque dum lux surgeret,        75
  sudavit inpar praelium.

    Sed cum iubar claresceret,
  lapsante claudus poplite
  femurque victus debile
  culpae vigorem perdidit.          80

    Nutabat inguen saucium,
  quae corporis pars vilior
  longeque sub cordis loco
  diram fovet libidinem.

    Hae nos docent imagines,        85
  hominem tenebris obsitum,
  si forte non cedat Deo,
  vires rebellis perdere.

    Erit tamen beatior,
  intemperans membrum cui           90
  luctando claudum et tabidum
  dies oborta invenerit.

    Tandem facessat caecitas,
  quae nosmet in praeceps diu
  lapsos sinistris gressibus        95
  errore traxit devio.

    Haec lux serenum conferat
  purosque nos praestet sibi:
  nihil loquamur subdolum,
  volvamus obscurum nihil.         100

    Sic tota decurrat dies,
  ne lingua mendax, ne manus,
  oculive peccent lubrici,
  ne noxa corpus inquinet.

    Speculator adstat desuper,     105
  qui nos diebus omnibus
  actusque nostros prospicit
  a luce prima in vesperum.

    Hic testis, hic est arbiter,
  his intuetur quidquid est,       110
  humana quod mens concipit;
  hunc nemo fallit iudicem.




                           II. MORNING HYMN


  Ye clouds and darkness, hosts of night
  That breed confusion and affright,
  Begone! o'erhead the dawn shines clear,
  The light breaks in and Christ is here.

  Earth's gloom flees broken and dispersed,
  By the sun's piercing shafts coerced:
  The daystar's eyes rain influence bright
  And colours glimmer back to sight.

  So shall our guilty midnight fade,
  The sin-stained heart's gross dusky shade:
  So shall the King's All-radiant Face
  Sudden unveil our deep disgrace.

  No longer then may we disguise
  Our dark intents from those clear eyes:
  Yea, at the dayspring's advent blest
  Our inmost thoughts will stand confest.

  The thief his hidden traffic plies
  Unmarked before the dawn doth rise:
  But light, the foe of guile concealed,
  Lets no ill craft lie unrevealed.

  Fraud and Deceit love only night,
  Their wiles they practise out of sight;
  Curtained by dark, Adultery too
  Doth his foul treachery pursue,

  But slinks abashed and shamed away
  Soon as the sun rekindles day,
  For none can damning light resist
  And 'neath its rays in sin persist.

  Who doth not blush o'ertook by morn
  And his long night's carousal scorn?
  For day subdues the lustful soul,
  And doth all foul desires control.

  Now each to earnest life awakes,
  Now each his wanton sport forsakes;
  Now foolish things are put away
  And gravity resumes her sway.

  It is the hour for duty's deeds,
  The path to which our labour leads,
  Be it the forum, army, sea,
  The mart or field or factory.

  One seeks the plaudits of the bar,
  One the stern trumpet calls to war:
  Those bent on trade and husbandry
  At greed's behest for lucre sigh.

  Mine is no rhetorician's fame,
  No petty usury I claim;
  Nor am I skilled to face the foe:
  'Tis Thou, O Christ, alone I know.
