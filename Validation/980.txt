Unity of Good

Caution in the Truth


Perhaps no doctrine of Christian Science rouses so much natural doubt and
questioning as this, that God knows no such thing as sin. Indeed, this may
be set down as one of the "things hard to be understood," such as the
apostle Peter declared were taught by his fellow-apostle Paul, "which they
that are unlearned and unstable wrest ... unto their own destruction." (2
Peter iii. 16.)

Let us then reason together on this important subject, whose statement in
Christian Science may justly be characterized as _wonderful_.


_Does God know or behold sin, sickness, and death?_

The nature and character of God is so little apprehended and demonstrated
by mortals, that I counsel my students to defer this infinite inquiry, in
their discussions of Christian Science. In fact, they had better leave the
subject untouched, until they draw nearer to the divine character, and are
practically able to testify, by their lives, that as they come closer to
the true understanding of God they lose all sense of error.

The Scriptures declare that God is too pure to behold iniquity (Habakkuk
i. 13); but they also declare that God pitieth them who fear Him; that
there is no place where His voice is not heard; that He is "a very present
help in trouble."

The sinner has no refuge from sin, except in God, who is his salvation. We
must, however, realize God's presence, power, and love, in order to be
saved from sin. This realization takes away man's fondness for sin and his
pleasure in it; and, lastly, it removes the pain which accrues to him from
it. Then follows this, as the _finale_ in Science: The sinner loses his
sense of sin, and gains a higher sense of God, in whom there is no sin.

The true man, really _saved_, is ready to testify of God in the infinite
penetration of Truth, and can affirm that the Mind which is good, or God,
has no knowledge of sin.

In the same manner the sick lose their sense of sickness, and gain that
spiritual sense of harmony which contains neither discord nor disease.

According to this same rule, in divine Science, the dying--if they die in
the Lord--awake from a sense of death to a sense of Life in Christ, with a
knowledge of Truth and Love beyond what they possessed before; because
their lives have grown so far toward the stature of manhood in Christ
Jesus, that they are ready for a spiritual transfiguration, through their
affections and understanding.

Those who reach this transition, called _death_, without having rightly
improved the lessons of this primary school of mortal existence,--and still
believe in matter's reality, pleasure, and pain,--are not ready to
understand immortality. Hence they awake only to another sphere of
experience, and must pass through another probationary state before it can
be truly said of them: "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord."

They upon whom the second death, of which we read in the Apocalypse
(Revelation xx. 6), hath no power, are those who have obeyed God's
commands, and have washed their robes white through the sufferings of the
flesh and the triumphs of Spirit. Thus they have reached the goal in divine
Science, by knowing Him in whom they have believed. This knowledge is not
the forbidden fruit of sin, sickness, and death, but it is the fruit which
grows on the "tree of life." This is the understanding of God, whereby man
is found in the image and likeness of good, not of evil; of health, not of
sickness; of Life, not of death.

God is All-in-all. Hence He is in Himself only, in His own nature and
character, and is perfect being, or consciousness. He is all the Life and
Mind there is or can be. Within Himself is every embodiment of Life and
Mind.

If He is All, He can have no consciousness of anything unlike Himself;
because, if He is omnipresent, there can be nothing outside of Himself.

Now this self-same God is our helper. He pities us. He has mercy upon us,
and guides every event of our careers. He is near to them who adore Him.
To understand Him, without a single taint of our mortal, finite sense of
sin, sickness, or death, is to approach Him and become like Him.

Truth is God, and in God's law. This law declares that Truth is All, and
there is no error. This law of Truth destroys every phase of error. To gain
a temporary consciousness of God's law is to feel, in a certain finite
human sense, that God comes to us and pities us; but the attainment of the
understanding of His presence, through the Science of God, destroys our
sense of imperfection, or of His absence, through a diviner sense that God
is all true consciousness; and this convinces us that, as we get still
nearer Him, we must forever lose our own consciousness of error.

But how could we lose all consciousness of error, if God be conscious of
it? God has not forbidden man to know Him; on the contrary, the Father bids
man have the same Mind "which was also in Christ Jesus,"--which was
certainly the divine Mind; but God does forbid man's acquaintance with
evil. Why? Because evil is no part of the divine knowledge.
