    Jove's will, his father's counsel and his own.
    All vote assent, nor doth his host refuse.
    No tarrying now; they write the matrons down,
    And all who faint or care not for renown
    They leave behind,--the idlers of each crew,
    But willing settlers in the new-planned town.
    These the charred timbers and the thwarts renew,
Shape oars and fit the ropes; a gallant band, but few.

CIII. AEneas with a ploughshare marks the town,
    And, homes allotting, gives each place a name,
    Here Troy, there Ilion. Pleased to wear the crown,
    A forum good Acestes hastes to frame,
    And laws to gathered senators proclaim.
    Rear'd high on Eryx, to the stars ascends
    A temple, to Idalian Venus' fame.
    A priest Anchises' sepulchre attends,
A grove's far sacred shade his hallowed dust defends.

CIV. The rites are paid, the nine-days' feast is o'er,
    Smooth lies the deep, and Southern winds invite
    The mariners. Along the winding shore
    Loud rise the sounds of sorrow, day and night,
    Where friends, clasped close in lingering undelight,
    Weep at the thought of parting. Matrons, ay,
    And men, who lately shuddered at the sight,
    And loathed the name of Ocean, scorn to stay,
And willing hearts now brave the long, laborious way.

CV. Kindly AEneas cheers them, and with tears
    Leaves to their King, then, parting, gives command
    A lamb to slay to tempest, and three steers
    To Eryx. So they loosen from the land.
    He on the prow, a charger in his hand,
    Flings forth the entrails, and outpours the wine,
    And, crowned with olive chaplet, takes his stand.
    Up-springs the favouring stern breeze, as in line
With emulous sweep of oars, they brush the level brine.

CVI. Then Venus, torn with anguish and desire,
    Spake thus to Neptune, and her grief confessed:
    "O Neptune, Juno's unrelenting ire,
    The quenchless malice, that consumes her breast,
    Constrains me thus to urge a suppliant's quest;
    And stoop, with humbled majesty, to sue.
    Her neither piety nor Jove's behest
    Nor time, nor Fate can soften or subdue,
Still doth immortal hate the Phrygian race pursue.

CVII. "'Tis not enough their city to destroy,
    And wear their remnant with remorseless pain,
    Needs must she trample on the dust of Troy.
    She best, forsooth, her fury can explain.
    But thou,--thou know'st how on the Libyan main,--
    Thine eyes beheld it from thy throne on high,--
    Lately she stirred the tumult, and in vain
    Armed with AEolian tempests, sea and sky
Mixed in rebellious wrath, thy sceptre to defy.

CVIII. "All this she ventured in thy realm; nay more,
    Her rage hath filled the matrons, fired the fleet,
    And left these crews upon an alien shore,
    Reft of their friends, and baffled of retreat.
    O spare this Trojan remnant, I entreat;
    Safe in thy guidance let them sail the main,
    And scatheless reach their promised walls, and greet
    Laurentian Tiber and the Latian plain,
If what I ask be just, and so the Fates ordain."

CIX. Then spake the Monarch of the deep: "'Tis just
    To look for safety to my realm, that gave
    Thee birth; and well have I deserved thy trust,
    Who oft have stilled the raging wind and wave;
    Nor less on land have interposed, to save--
    Xanthus and Simois I attest again--
    Thy darling son, when back Achilles drave
    Troy's breathless host, and rivers, choked with slain,
Groaned, ay, and Xanthus scarce could struggle to the main.

CX. "Then, as with adverse Gods and feebler power
    He faced Pelides, in a cloud I caught
    Thy favourite, albeit 'twas the hour
    When, wroth with perjured Ilion, I sought
    To raze the walls these very hands had wrought.
    Fear not; unaltered doth my will remain.
    Safe shall he be into this haven brought.
    One, only one, for many shall be slain;
One in the deep thy son shall look for, but in vain."

CXI. So saying, he soothed the Goddess, and in haste
    His steeds with golden harness yoked amain.
    The bridle and the foaming bit he placed,
    To curb their fury, and outflung the rein.
    Lightly he flies along the watery plain,
    Borne in his azure chariot. Far and nigh
    Beneath his thundering wheels the heaving main
    Sinks, and the waves are tranquil, and on high
Through flying storm-drift shines the immeasurable sky.

CXII. Behind him throng, in many a motley group,
    His followers--monsters of enormous chine,
    Sea-shouldering whales, and Glaucus' aged troop,
    Paloemon, Ino's progeny divine,
    Swift Tritons, born to gambol in the brine,
    And Phorcus' finny legions. Melite,
    And virgin Panopoea leftward shine,
    Thetis, Nesaee, daughters of the sea,
Spio, Thalia fair, and bright Cymodoce.

CXIII. Then o'er AEneas' spirit, racked with fear,
    Joy stole in gentle counterchange. He hails
    The crews, and biddeth them the masts uprear,
    And stretch the sheets. All, tacking, loose the brails
    Larboard or starboard, and let go the sails,
    And square or sideways to the breeze incline
    The lofty sailyards. Welcome blow the gales
    Behind them. Palinurus leads the line;
The rest his course obey, and follow at his sign.

CXIV. Damp Night well-nigh had climbed Olympus' crest;
    Each slumbering mariner his limbs unbends,
    Stretched by his oar, along the bench at rest,
    When lo! false Sleep his feathery wings extends.
    To guiltless Palinurus he descends,
    Parting the scattered shadows. Down he bears
    Delusive dreams, and cunning words pretends,
    As now, in Phorbas' likeness he appears,
Perched on the lofty stern, and whispers in his ears:

CXV. "Son of Iasus! see, the tide that flows
    Bears thee along; behind thee breathes apace
    The stern breeze, and the hour invites repose.
    Rest now, and cheat thy wearied eyes a space,
    Myself will take the rudder in thy place."
    "Nay," quoth the pilot, with half-lifted eyes,
    "Shall I put faith in ocean's treacherous face,
    And trust AEneas to the flattering skies,
I, whom their smiles oft fooled, but folly hath made wise?"

CXVI. So saying, he grasped the tiller, nor his hold
    Relaxed, nor ever from the stars withdrew
    His steadfast eyes, still watchful when behold!
    A slumberous bough the god revealed to view,
    Thrice dipt in Styx, and drenched with Lethe's dew.
    Then, lightly sprinkling, o'er the pilot's brows
    The drowsy dewdrops from the leaves he threw.
    Dim grow his eyes; the languor of repose
Steals o'er his faltering sense, the lingering eyelids close.

CXVII. Scarce now his limbs were loosened by the spell,
    Down weighed the god, and in the rolling main
    Dashed him headforemost, clutching, as he fell,
    Stern timbers torn, and rudder rent in twain,
    And calling oft his comrades, but in vain.
    This done, his wings he balanced, and away
    Soared skyward. Natheless o'er the broad sea-plain
    The ships sail on; safe lies the watery way,
For Neptune's plighted words the seamen's cares allay.

CXVIII. Now near the Sirens' perilous cliffs they draw,
    White with men's bones, and hear the surf-beat side
    Roar with hoarse thunder. Here the Sire, who saw
    The ship was labouring, and had lost her guide,
    Straight seized the helm, and steered her through the tide,
    While, grieved in heart, with many a groan and sigh,
    He mourned for Palinurus. "Ah," he cried,
    "For faith reposed on flattering sea and sky,
Left on an unknown shore, thy naked corpse must lie!"




BOOK SIX


ARGUMENT

Arrived at Cumae AEneas visits the Sibyl's shrine, and, after prayer
and sacrifice to Apollo, asks access to the nether-world to visit
his father (1-162). He must first pluck for Proserpine the golden
bough and bury a dead comrade (163-198). After the death and burial
of Misenus, AEneas finds and gathers the golden bough (199-261).
Preparation and Invocation (262-328). The start (329-333). The
"dreadful faces" that guard the outskirts of Hell. Charon's ferry
and the unburied dead (334-405). Palinurus approaches and entreats
burial. Passing by Charon and Cerberus, they see the phantoms of
suicides, of children, of lovers, and experience Dido's disdain
(406-559). From Greek and Trojan shades Deiphobus is singled out to
tell his story (560-644). The Sibyl hurries AEneas on past the
approach to Tartarus, describing by the way its rulers and its
horrors. Finally, they reach Elysium and gain entrance (645-757).
The search among the shades of the Blessed for Anchises, and the
meeting between father and son (758-828). Anchises explains the
mystery of the Transmigration of Souls, and the book closes with the
revelation to AEneas of the future greatness of Rome, whose heroes,
from the days of the kings to the times of Augustus, pass in
procession before him (829-1071). He is then dismissed through the
Ivory Gate, and sails on his way to Caieta (1072-1080).


I.  Weeping he speaks, and gives his fleet the rein,
    And glides at length to the Euboean strand
    Of Cumae. There, with prows towards the main,
    Safe-fastened by the biting anchors, stand
    The vessels, and the round sterns line the land.
    Forth on the shore, in eager haste to claim
    Hesperia's welcome, leaps a youthful band.
    These search the flint-stones for the seeds of flame,
Those point to new-found streams, or scour the woods for game.

II. But good AEneas seeks the castled height
    And temple, to the great Apollo dear,
    And the vast cave where, hidden far from sight
    Within her sanctuary dark and drear,
    Dwells the dread Sibyl, whom the Delian seer
    Inspires with soul and wisdom to unfold
    The things to come.--So now, approaching near
    Through Trivia's grove, the temple they behold,
And entering, see the roof all glittering with gold.

III. Fame is, that Daedalus, adventuring forth
    On rapid wings, from Minos' realms in flight,
    Trusted the sky, and to the frosty North
    Swam his strange way, till on the tower-girt height
    Of Chalcis gently he essayed to light.
    Here, touching first the wished-for land again,
    To thee, great Phoebus, and thy guardian might,
    He vowed, and bade as offerings to remain,
The oarage of his wings, and built a stately fane.

IV. Androgeos' death is graven on the gate;
    There stand the sons of Cecrops, doomed each year
    With seven victims to atone his fate.
    The lots are drawn; the fatal urn is near.
    Here, o'er the deep the Gnossian fields appear,
    The bull--the cruel passion--the embrace
    Stol'n from Pasiphae--all the tale is here;
    The Minotaur, half human, beast in face,
Record of nameless lust, and token of disgrace.

V.  There, toil-wrought house and labyrinthine grove,
    With tangled maze, too intricate to tread,
    But that, in pity for the queen's great love,
    Its secret Daedalus revealed, and led
    Her lover's blinded footsteps with a thread.
    There, too, had sorrow not the wish denied,
    Thy name and fame, poor Icarus, were read.
    Twice in the gold to carve thy fate he tried,
And twice the father's hands dropped faltering to his side.

VI. So they in gazing had the time beguiled,
    But now, returning from his quest, comes near
    Achates, with Deiphobe, the child
    Of Glaucus, Phoebus' and Diana's seer.
    "Not this," she cries, "the time for tarrying here
    For shows like these. Go, hither bring with speed
    Seven ewes, the choicest, and with each a steer
    Unyoked, in honour of the God to bleed."
So to the Chief she spake, and straight his followers heed.

VII. Into the lofty temple now with speed,--
    A huge cave hollowed in the mountain's side,--
    The priestess calls the Teucrians. Thither lead
    A hundred doors, a hundred entries wide,
    A hundred voices from the rock inside
    Peal forth, the Sibyl answering. So they
    Had reached the threshold, when the maiden cried,
    "Now 'tis the time to seek the fates and pray;
Behold, behold the God!" and standing there, straightway,

VIII. Her colour and her features change; loose streams
    Her hair disordered, and her heart distrest
    Swells with wild frenzy. Larger now she seems,
    Her voice not mortal, as her heaving breast
    Pants, with the approaching Deity possest.
    "Pray, Trojan," peals her warning utterance, "pray!
    Cease not, AEneas, nor withhold thy quest,
    Nor stint thy vows. While dumbly ye delay,
Ne'er shall its yawning doors the spell-bound house display."

IX. She ceased: at once an icy chill ran through
    The sturdy Trojans. From his inmost heart
    Thus prayed the King: "O Phoebus, wont to view
    With pity Troy's sore travail; thou, whose art
    True to Achilles aimed the Dardan dart,
    How oft, thou guiding, have I tracked the main
    Round mighty lands, to earth's remotest part
    Massylian tribes and Libya's sandy plain:
Scarce now the flying shores of Italy we gain.

X.  "Enough, thus far Troy's destinies to bear,
    Ye, too, at length, your anger may abate
    And deign the race of Pergamus to spare,
    O Gods and Goddesses, who viewed with hate
    Troy and the glories of the Dardan state.
    And thou, dread mistress of prophetic lore,
    Grant us--I ask but what is due by Fate,
    Our promised realms--that on the Latian shore
Troy's sons and wandering gods may find a home once more.

XI. "To Phoebus then and Trivia's sacred name,
    Thy patron powers, a temple will I rear
    Of solid marble, and due rites proclaim
    And festal days, for votaries each year
    The name of guardian Phoebus to revere.
    Thee, too, hereafter in our realms await
    Shrines of the stateliest, for thy name is dear.
    There safe shall rest the mystic words of Fate,
And chosen priests shall guard the oracles of state.

XII. "Only to leaves commit not, priestess kind,
    Thy verse, lest fragments of the mystic scroll
    Fly, tost abroad, the playthings of the wind.
    Thyself in song the oracle unroll."
    He ceased; the seer, impatient of control,
    Strives, like a frenzied Bacchant, in her cell,
    To shake the mighty deity from her soul.
    So much the more, her raging heart to quell,
He tires the foaming mouth, and shapes her to his spell.

XIII. Then yawned the hundred gates, and every door,
    Self-opening suddenly, revealed the fane,
    And through the air the Sibyl's answer bore:
    "O freed from Ocean's perils, but in vain,
    Worse evils yet upon the land remain.
    Doubt not; Troy's sons shall reach Lavinium's shore,
    And rule in Latium; so the Fates ordain.
    Yet shall they rue their coming. Woes in store,
Wars, savage wars, I see, and Tiber foam with gore.

XIV. "A Xanthus there and Simois shall be seen,
    And Doric tents; Achilles, goddess-born,
    Shall rise anew, nor Jove's relentless Queen
    Shall cease to vex the Teucrians night and morn.
    Then oft shalt thou, sore straitened and forlorn,
    All towns and tribes of Italy implore
    To grant thee shelter from the foemen's scorn.
    An alien bride, a foreign bed once more
Shall bring the old, old woes, the ancient feud restore.

XV. "Yield not to evils, but the bolder thou
    Persist, defiant of misfortune's frown,
    And take the path thy Destinies allow.
    Hope, where unlooked for, comes thy toils to crown,
    Thy road to safety from a Grecian town."
    So sang the Sibyl from her echoing fane,
    And, wrapping truth in mystery, made known
    The dark enigmas of her frenzied strain.
So Phoebus plied the goad, and shook the maddening rein.

XVI. Soon ceased the fit, the foaming lips were still.
    "O maiden," said AEneas, "me no more
    Can danger startle, nor strange shape of ill.
    All have I seen and throughly conned before.
    One boon I beg,--since yonder are the door
    Of Pluto, and the gloomy lakes, they tell,
    Fed by o'erflowing Acheron,--once more
    To see the father whom I loved so well.
Teach me the way, and ope the sacred gates of hell.

XVII. "Him on these shoulders, in the days ago,
    A thousand darts behind us, did I bear
    Safe through the thickest of the flames and foe.
    He, partner of my travels, loved to share
    The threats of ocean and the storms of air,
    Though weak, yet strong beyond the lot of age.
    'Twas he who bade me, with prevailing prayer,
    Approach thee humbly, and thy care engage,
Pity the sire and son, and Trojan hearts assuage.

XVIII. "For thou can'st all, nor Hecate for naught
    Hath set thee o'er Avernus' groves to reign.
    If Orpheus from the shades his bride up-brought,
    Trusting his Thracian harp and sounding strain,
    If Pollux could from Pluto's drear domain
    His brother by alternate death reclaim,
    And tread the road to Hades o'er again
    Oft and so oft--why great Alcides name?
Why Theseus? I, as they, Jove's ancestry can claim."

XIX. So prayed AEneas, clinging to the shrine,
    When thus the prophetess: "O Trojan Knight,
    Born of Anchises, and of seed divine,
    Down to Avernus the descent is light,
    The gate of Dis stands open day and night.
    But upward thence thy journey to retrace,
    There lies the labour; 'tis a task of might,
    By few achieved, and those of heavenly race,
Whom shining worth extolled or Jove hath deigned to grace.

XX. "Thick woods and shades the middle space invest,
    And black Cocytus girds the drear abode.
    Yet, if such passion hath thy soul possessed,
    If so thou longest to indulge thy mood,
    And madly twice to cross the Stygian flood,
    And visit twice black Tartarus, mark the way
    Sacred to nether Juno, in a wood,
    With golden stem and foliage, lurks a spray,
And trees and darksome dales surrounding shroud the day.

XXI. "Yet none the shades can visit, till he tear
    That golden growth, the gift of Pluto's queen,
    And show the passport she decreed to bear.
    One plucked, another in its place is seen,
    As bright and burgeoning with golden green.
    Search then aloft, and when thou see'st the spray,
    Reach forth and pluck it; willingly, I ween,
    If Fate shall call thee, 'twill thy touch obey;
Else steel nor strength of arm shall rend the prize away.

XXII. "Mark yet--alas! thou know'st not--yonder lies
    Thy friend's dead body, and pollutes the shore.
    While thou the Fates art asking to advise,
    And lingering here, a suppliant, at our door.
    Nay, first thy comrade to his home restore,
    And build a tomb, and bring black cattle; they
    The stain shall expiate; so the Stygian shore
    Shalt thou behold, and tread the sunless way,
Which living feet ne'er trod, and mounted to the day."

XXIII. She ended. From the cave AEneas went,
    With down-dropt eyes and melancholy mien,
    Inly revolving many a dark event.
    Trusty Achates at his side is seen,
    Moody alike, each measured step between
    In musing converse framing phantasies,
    What lifeless comrade could the priestess mean?
    Whom to be buried? When before their eyes,
Stretched on the barren beach the dead Misenus lies,

XXIV. Dead with dishonour, in unseemly plight,
    Misenus, son of AEolus, whom beside
    None better knew with brazen blast to light
    The flames of war, and wake the warrior's pride.
    Once Hector's co-mate, proud at Hector's side
    To wind the clarion and the sword to wield.
    When, stricken by Achilles, Hector died,
    AEneas then he followed to the field,
Loth to a meaner lord his fealty to yield.

XXV. Now while a challenge to the gods he blew,
    And made the waves his hollow shell resound,
    Him Triton, jealous--if the tale be true--
    Caught unaware, and in the surges drowned
    Among the rocks.--There now the corpse they found.
    Loud groaned AEneas, and a mournful cry
    Rose from the Trojans, as they gazed around.
    Then, filled with tears, the Sibyl's task they ply,
And rear a wood-built pile and altar to the sky.

XXVI. Into a grove of aged trees they go,
    The wild-beasts' lair. The holm-oak rings amain,
    Smit with the axe, the pitchy pine falls low,
    Sharp wedges cleave the beechen core in twain,
    The mountain ash comes rolling to the plain.
    Foremost himself, accoutred as the rest,
    AEneas cheered them, toiling with his train;
    Then, musing sadly, and with pensive breast,
Gazed on the boundless grove, and thus his prayer addressed:

XXVII. "O in this grove could I behold the tree
    With golden bough; since true, alas, too true,
    Misenus, hath the priestess sung of thee!"
    He spake, when, lighting on the sward, down flew
    Two doves. With joy his mother's birds he knew,
    "Lead on, blest guides, along the air," he prayed,
    "If way there be, the precious bough to view,
    Whose golden leaves the teeming soil o'ershade;
O mother, solve my doubts, nor stint the needed aid."

XXVIII. So saying, he stays his footsteps, fain to heed
    What signs they give, and whitherward their flight.
    Awhile they fly, awhile they stop to feed,
    Then, fluttering, keep within the range of sight,
    Till, coming where Avernus, dark as night,
    Gapes, with rank vapours from its depths uprolled,
    Aloft they soar, and through the liquid height
    Dart to the tree, where, wondrous to behold,
The varying green sets forth the glitter of the gold.

XXIX. As in the woods, in winter's cold, is seen,
    Sown on an alien tree, the mistletoe
    To bloom afresh with foliage newly green,
    And round the tapering boles its arms to throw,
    Laden with yellow fruitage, even so
    The oak's dark boughs the golden leaves display,
    So the foil rustles in the breezes low.
    Quickly AEneas plucks the lingering spray,
And to the Sibyl bears the welcome gift away.

XXX. Nor less the dead Misenus they deplore,
    And honours to the thankless dust assign.
    A stately pyre they build upon the shore,
    Rich with oak-timbers and the resinous pine,
    And sombre foliage in the sides entwine.
    In front, the cypress marks the fatal soil,
    Above, they leave the warrior's arms to shine.
    These heat the water, till the caldrons boil,
And wash the stiffened limbs, and fill the wounds with oil.

XXXI. Loud is the wailing; then with many a tear
    They lay him on the bed, and o'er him throw
    His purple robes. These lift the massive bier;
