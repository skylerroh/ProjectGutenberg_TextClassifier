Fragment #40A--(Cp. Fr. 43 and 44) Oxyrhynchus Papyri 1358 fr. 2 (3rd
cent. A.D.): [1732] ((LACUNA--Slight remains of 7 lines))

(ll. 8-35) '(The Sons of Boreas pursued the Harpies) to the lands of the
Massagetae and of the proud Half-Dog men, of the Underground-folk and of
the feeble Pygmies; and to the tribes of the boundless Black-skins
and the Libyans. Huge Earth bare these to Epaphus--soothsaying
people, knowing seercraft by the will of Zeus the lord of oracles, but
deceivers, to the end that men whose thought passes their utterance
[1733] might be subject to the gods and suffer harm--Aethiopians and
Libyans and mare-milking Scythians. For verily Epaphus was the child of
the almighty Son of Cronos, and from him sprang the dark Libyans, and
high-souled Aethiopians, and the Underground-folk and feeble Pygmies.
All these are the offspring of the lord, the Loud-thunderer. Round about
all these (the Sons of Boreas) sped in darting flight.... ....of the
well-horsed Hyperboreans--whom Earth the all-nourishing bare far off by
the tumbling streams of deep-flowing Eridanus........of amber, feeding
her wide-scattered offspring--and about the steep Fawn mountain and
rugged Etna to the isle Ortygia and the people sprung from Laestrygon
who was the son of wide-reigning Poseidon. Twice ranged the Sons of
Boreas along this coast and wheeled round and about yearning to catch
the Harpies, while they strove to escape and avoid them. And they sped
to the tribe of the haughty Cephallenians, the people of patient-souled
Odysseus whom in aftertime Calypso the queenly nymph detained
for Poseidon. Then they came to the land of the lord the son of
Ares........they heard. Yet still (the Sons of Boreas) ever pursued them
with instant feet. So they (the Harpies) sped over the sea and through
the fruitless air...'


Fragment #40--Strabo, vii. p. 300: 'The Aethiopians and Ligurians and
mare-milking Scythians.'


Fragment #41--Apollodorus, i. 9.21.6: As they were being pursued, one
of the Harpies fell into the river Tigris, in Peloponnesus which is
now called Harpys after her. Some call this one Nicothoe, and others
Aellopus. The other who was called Ocypete, or as some say Ocythoe
(though Hesiod calls her Ocypus), fled down the Propontis and reached
as far as to the Echinades islands which are now called because of her,
Strophades (Turning Islands).


Fragment #42--Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, Arg. ii. 297: Hesiod also
says that those with Zetes [1734] turned and prayed to Zeus: 'There they
prayed to the lord of Aenos who reigns on high.'

Apollonius indeed says it was Iris who made Zetes and his following turn
away, but Hesiod says Hermes.

Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, Arg. ii. 296: Others say (the islands)
were called Strophades, because they turned there and prayed Zeus to
seize the Harpies. But according to Hesiod... they were not killed.

Hesiod who mentions.... or even the Troglodytes and the Pygmies.

says they (the Argonauts) had sailed in through the Phasis.

Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, Arg. iv. 259: But Hesiod (says)....
they came through the Ocean to Libya, and so, carrying the Argo, reached
our sea.


Fragment #46--Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, Arg. iii. 311:
Apollonius, following Hesiod, says that Circe came to the island over
against Tyrrhenia on the chariot of the Sun. And he called it Hesperian,
because it lies toward the west.


Fragment #47--Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, Arg. iv. 892: He
(Apollonius) followed Hesiod who thus names the island of the Sirens:
'To the island Anthemoessa (Flowery) which the son of Cronos gave them.'

And their names are Thelxiope or Thelxinoe, Molpe and Aglaophonus
[1736].

Amarynces, leader of the Epeians.


Fragment #51--Apollodorus, i. 8.4.1: When Althea was dead, Oeneus
married Periboea, the daughter of Hipponous. Hesiod says that she
was seduced by Hippostratus the son of Amarynces and that her father
Hipponous sent her from Olenus in Achaea to Oeneus because he was far
away from Hellas, bidding him kill her.

'She used to dwell on the cliff of Olenus by the banks of wide Peirus.'


Fragment #52--Diodorus [1737] v. 81: Macareus was a son of Crinacus the
son of Zeus as Hesiod says... and dwelt in Olenus in the country then
called Ionian, but now Achaean.


Fragment #53--Scholiast on Pindar, Nem. ii. 21: Concerning the Myrmidons
Hesiod speaks thus: 'And she conceived and bare Aeacus, delighting in
horses. Now when he came to the full measure of desired youth, he chafed
at being alone. And the father of men and gods made all the ants that
were in the lovely isle into men and wide-girdled women. These were the
first who fitted with thwarts ships with curved sides, and the first who
used sails, the wings of a sea-going ship.'


Fragment #54--Polybius, v. 2: 'The sons of Aeacus who rejoiced in battle
as though a feast.'


Fragment #55--Porphyrius, Quaest. Hom. ad Iliad. pertin. p. 93: He
has indicated the shameful deed briefly by the phrase 'to lie with her
against her will', and not like Hesiod who recounts at length the story
of Peleus and the wife of Acastus.


Fragment #56--Scholiast on Pindar, Nem. iv. 95: 'And this seemed to him
(Acastus) in his mind the best plan; to keep back himself, but to hide
beyond guessing the beautiful knife which the very famous Lame One had
made for him, that in seeking it alone over steep Pelion, he (Peleus)
might be slain forthwith by the mountain-bred Centaurs.'


Fragment #57--Voll. Herculan. (Papyri from Herculaneum), 2nd Collection,
viii. 105: The author of the "Cypria" [1738] says that Thetis avoided
wedlock with Zeus to please Hera; but that Zeus was angry and swore that
she should mate with a mortal. Hesiod also has the like account.


Fragment #58--Strassburg Greek Papyri 55 (2nd century A.D.): (ll. 1-13)
'Peleus the son of Aeacus, dear to the deathless gods, came to Phthia
the mother of flocks, bringing great possessions from spacious Iolcus.
And all the people envied him in their hearts seeing how he had sacked
the well-built city, and accomplished his joyous marriage; and they all
spake this word: "Thrice, yea, four times blessed son of Aeacus, happy
Peleus! For far-seeing Olympian Zeus has given you a wife with many
gifts and the blessed gods have brought your marriage fully to pass, and
in these halls you go up to the holy bed of a daughter of Nereus. Truly
the father, the son of Cronos, made you very pre-eminent among heroes
and honoured above other men who eat bread and consume the fruit of the
ground."'


Fragment #59--[1739] Origen, Against Celsus, iv. 79: 'For in common then

the rest call her (Peleus' daughter) Polydora.


Fragment #61--Eustathius, Hom. 112. 44 sq: It should be observed that
the ancient narrative hands down the account that Patroclus was even
a kinsman of Achilles; for Hesiod says that Menoethius the father of
Patroclus, was a brother of Peleus, so that in that case they were first
cousins.


Fragment #62--Scholiast on Pindar, Ol. x. 83: Some write 'Serus the son
of Halirrhothius', whom Hesiod mentions: 'He (begot) Serus and Alazygus,
goodly sons.' And Serus was the son of Halirrhothius Perieres' son, and
of Alcyone.


Fragment #63--Pausanias [1740], ii. 26. 7: This oracle most clearly
proves that Asclepius was not the son of Arsinoe, but that Hesiod or one
of Hesiod's interpolators composed the verses to please the Messenians.

Scholiast on Pindar, Pyth. iii. 14: Some say (Asclepius) was the son of
Arsinoe, others of Coronis. But Asclepiades says that Arsinoe was
the daughter of Leucippus, Perieres' son, and that to her and Apollo
Asclepius and a daughter, Eriopis, were born: 'And she bare in the
palace Asclepius, leader of men, and Eriopis with the lovely hair, being
subject in love to Phoebus.'

And of Arsinoe likewise: 'And Arsinoe was joined with the son of Zeus
and Leto and bare a son Asclepius, blameless and strong.' [1741]


Fragment #67--Scholiast on Euripides, Orestes 249: Steischorus says that
while sacrificing to the gods Tyndareus forgot Aphrodite and that
the goddess was angry and made his daughters twice and thrice wed and
deserters of their husbands.... And Hesiod also says:

(ll. 1-7) 'And laughter-loving Aphrodite felt jealous when she looked on
them and cast them into evil report. Then Timandra deserted Echemus
and went and came to Phyleus, dear to the deathless gods; and even so
Clytaemnestra deserted god-like Agamemnon and lay with Aegisthus
and chose a worse mate; and even so Helen dishonoured the couch of
golden-haired Menelaus.'


Fragment #68--[1742] Berlin Papyri, No. 9739: (ll. 1-10)
'....Philoctetes sought her, a leader of spearmen, .... most famous of
all men at shooting from afar and with the sharp spear. And he came
to Tyndareus' bright city for the sake of the Argive maid who had the
beauty of golden Aphrodite, and the sparkling eyes of the Graces; and
the dark-faced daughter of Ocean, very lovely of form, bare her when
she had shared the embraces of Zeus and the king Tyndareus in the bright
palace.... (And.... sought her to wife offering as gifts)

((LACUNA))

(ll. 11-15)....and as many women skilled in blameless arts, each holding
a golden bowl in her hands. And truly Castor and strong Polydeuces
would have made him [1743] their brother perforce, but Agamemnon, being
son-in-law to Tyndareus, wooed her for his brother Menelaus.

(ll. 16-19) And the two sons of Amphiaraus the lord, Oecleus' son,
sought her to wife from Argos very near at hand; yet.... fear of the
blessed gods and the indignation of men caused them also to fail.

((LACUNA))

(l. 20)...but there was no deceitful dealing in the sons of Tyndareus.

(ll. 21-27) And from Ithaca the sacred might of Odysseus, Laertes son,
who knew many-fashioned wiles, sought her to wife. He never sent gifts
for the sake of the neat-ankled maid, for he knew in his heart that
golden-haired Menelaus would win, since he was greatest of the Achaeans
in possessions and was ever sending messages [1744] to horse-taming
Castor and prize-winning Polydeuces.

(ll. 28-30) And....on's son sought her to wife (and brought)
....bridal-gifts.... ....cauldrons....

((LACUNA))

(ll. 31-33)...to horse-taming Castor and prize-winning Polydeuces,
desiring to be the husband of rich-haired Helen, though he had never
seen her beauty, but because he heard the report of others.

(ll. 34-41) And from Phylace two men of exceeding worth sought her to
wife, Podarces son of Iphiclus, Phylacus' son, and Actor's noble
son, overbearing Protesilaus. Both of them kept sending messages to
Lacedaemon, to the house of wise Tyndareus, Oebalus' son, and they
offered many bridal-gifts, for great was the girl's renown, brazen....
....golden....

((LACUNA))

(l. 42)...(desiring) to be the husband of rich-haired Helen.

(ll. 43-49) From Athens the son of Peteous, Menestheus, sought her to
wife, and offered many bridal-gifts; for he possessed very many stored
treasures, gold and cauldrons and tripods, fine things which lay hid in
the house of the lord Peteous, and with them his heart urged him to win
