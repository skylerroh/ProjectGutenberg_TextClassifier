         _To escape from Mars, all Clayton had to do was the
         impossible. Break out of a crack-proof exile camp--get
         onto a ship that couldn't be boarded--smash through an
         impenetrable wall of steel. Perhaps he could do all
         these things, but he discovered that Mars did evil
         things to men; that he wasn't even Clayton any more.
         He was only--_

"I want you to put me in prison!" the big, hairy man said in a trembling
voice.

He was addressing his request to a thin woman sitting behind a desk that
seemed much too big for her. The plaque on the desk said:

                           LT. PHOEBE HARRIS
                     TERRAN REHABILITATION SERVICE

Lieutenant Harris glanced at the man before her for only a moment before
she returned her eyes to the dossier on the desk; but long enough to
verify the impression his voice had given. Ron Clayton was a big, ugly,
cowardly, dangerous man.

He said: "Well? Dammit, say something!"

The lieutenant raised her eyes again. "Just be patient until I've read
this." Her voice and eyes were expressionless, but her hand moved
beneath the desk.

Clayton froze. _She's yellow!_ he thought. She's turned on the trackers!
He could see the pale greenish glow of their little eyes watching him
all around the room. If he made any fast move, they would cut him down
with a stun beam before he could get two feet.

She had thought he was going to jump her. _Little rat!_ he thought,
_somebody ought to slap her down!_

He watched her check through the heavy dossier in front of her. Finally,
she looked up at him again.

"Clayton, your last conviction was for strong-arm robbery. You were
given a choice between prison on Earth and freedom here on Mars. You
picked Mars."

He nodded slowly. He'd been broke and hungry at the time. A sneaky
little rat named Johnson had bilked Clayton out of his fair share of the
Corey payroll job, and Clayton had been forced to get the money somehow.
He hadn't mussed the guy up much; besides, it was the sucker's own
fault. If he hadn't tried to yell--

Lieutenant Harris went on: "I'm afraid you can't back down now."

"But it isn't fair! The most I'd have got on that frame-up would've
been ten years. I've been here fifteen already!"

"I'm sorry, Clayton. It can't be done. You're here. Period. Forget about
trying to get back. Earth doesn't want you." Her voice sounded choppy,
as though she were trying to keep it calm.

Clayton broke into a whining rage. "You can't do that! It isn't fair! I
never did anything to you! I'll go talk to the Governor! He'll listen to
reason! You'll see! I'll--"

"_Shut up!_" the woman snapped harshly. "I'm getting sick of it! I
personally think you should have been locked up--permanently. I think
this idea of forced colonization is going to breed trouble for Earth
someday, but it is about the only way you can get anybody to colonize
this frozen hunk of mud.

"Just keep it in mind that I don't like it any better than you do--_and
I didn't strong-arm anybody to deserve the assignment!_ Now get out of
here!"

She moved a hand threateningly toward the manual controls of the stun
beam.
