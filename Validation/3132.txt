Let me feed on Thee.

5.
So shall no fears chill me
On that unknown shore;
For in death He conquered,
And can die no more.
His Hand guards and guides me
To the heav'nly door.

6.
Bless'ed warfare over,
Endless rest alone;
Tears no more, nor sorrow,
Neither sigh nor moan,
But a song of triumph
Round about the throne.

GENERAL, The Praise of God

Praise we our God with joy

Processional
Canon Oakeley
Nicola A. Montani


Allegro maestoso (with well-marked rhythm)

1.
Praise we our God with joy
And gladness never ending;
Angels and Saints with us
Their grateful voices blending.
He is our Father dear,
O'erfilled with Father's love;
Mercies unsought, unknown
He showers from above,

2.
He is our Shepherd true,
With watchful care unsleeping;
On us, his erring sheep,
An eye of pity keeping.
He with a mighty arm
The bonds of sin doth break,
And to our burden'd hearths
In words of peace doth speak.

3.
Bleeding, we lay, but He
With soothing bands hath bound us;
Dark was our path, but He
Hath poured His light around us;
Graces in copious streams
From that pure fountain come,
Down to our heart of hearts,
Where God hath set his home.

4.
His Word our lantern is,
His Peace our consolation;
His sweetness all our rest,
Himself our great Salvation!
Then live we all to God,
Rely on Him in faith,
Be He our guide in life,
Our joy, our hope, in death.

Praise to the Holiest in the height
Dream of Gerontius

Processional
Cardinal Newman
Nicola A. Montani


With spirit

1.
Praise the Holiest in the height,
And in the depth be praise;
In all His words most wonderful,
Most sure in all His ways!

2.
O loving wisdom of our God!
When all was sin and shame,
A second Adam to the fight
And to the rescue came.

3.
O wisest love! That flesh and blood
Which did in Adam fail,
Should strive afresh against the foe;
Should strive and should prevail;

4.
And that a higher gift than grace
Should flesh and blood refine,
God's Presence and His very Self,
And Essence all divine.

5.
O gen'rous love! The He who smote
In man for man the foe,
The double agony in man
For man should undergo;

6.
And in the garden secretly,
And on the Cross on High,
Should teach His brethren and inspire
To suffer and to die.

Lord, for tomorrow and its needs
("Just for today")

Sister M. Xavier
Nicola A. Montani


Slowly

1.
Lord, for tomorrow and its needs I do not pray:
Keep me, my God, from stain of sin, Just for today.
Let me both diligently work, And duly pray:
Let me be kind in word or deed, Just for today.

2.
Let me be slow to do my will, Prompt to obey:
Help me to mortify my flesh, Just for today.
Let me no wrong or idle word Unthinkingly say;
Set Thou a seal upon my lips, Just for today.

3.
Let me in season, Lord, be grave, In season, gay;
Let me be faithful to Thy Grace, Just for today.
And if today my tide of life Should ebb away,
Give me Thy Sacraments divine, Sweet Lord, today.

4.
In purgatory's cleansing fires Brief be my stay;
Oh, bid me, if today I die, Go home today.
So, for tomorrow and its needs, I do not pray;
But keep me, guide me, love me, Lord, just for today.

1.
Why art thou sorrowful, servant of God?
And what is this dulness that hangs o'er thee now?
Sing the praises of Jesus, and sing them aloud,
And the song shall dispel the dark cloud from thy brow.
Sing the praises of Jesus, and sing them aloud,
And the song shall dispel the dark cloud from thy brow.

2.
Oh, is there a thought in the wide world so sweet,
As that God has so cared for us, bad as we are,
That He thinks for us, plans for us, stoops to entreat,
And follows us, wander we ever so far?
That He thinks for us, plans for us, stoops to entreat,
And follows u, wander we ever so far?

3.
Oh, then, when the spirit of darkness comes down
With clouds of uncertainties into thy heart,
One look to thy Saviour, one thought of thy crown,
And the tempest is over, the shadows depart.
One look to thy Saviour, one thought of thy crown,
And the tempest is over, the shadows depart.

4.
That God hath once whispered a word in thine ear,
Or sent thee from Heaven one sorrow for sin,
Is enough for a life both to banish all fear,
And to turn into peace all the troubles within.

OUR MOTHER OF SORROWS
Passiontide and B. V. M.

What a Sea of Tears and Sorrows
O quot undis lacrymarum

Tr. by Rev. F. Campbell
Ch. Gounod
Arr. by N. A. M.


Andante religioso

1.
What a sea of tears and sorrows
Did the soul of Mary toss
To and fro upon its billows
While she wept her bitter loss;
In her arms her Jesus holding,
Torn so newly from the Cross.

2.
Oh, that mournful Virgin Mother,
See her tears how fast they flow
Down upon His mangled Body
Wounded Side and thorny Brow;
While His Hands and Feet she kisses,
Picture of immortal woe.

3.
Oft, and oft His Arms and Bosom,
Fondly straining to her own;
Oft, her pallid lips imprinting
On each Wound of her dear Son:
Till at last in swoons of anguish,
Sense and consciousness are gone.

4.
Gentle Mother, we beseech thee,
By thy tears and troubles sore;
By the death of thy dear Offspring,
By the bloody Wounds He bore;
Touch our hearts with that true sorrow
Which affected thee of yore.

HOLY MATRIMONY

Lord, Who at Cana's Wedding Feast

A. Thrupp
J. Lewis Browne


Moderato

1.
Lord, who at Cana's wedding feast
Didst as a guest appear,
Thou, dearer far than earthly guest,
Vouchsafe Thy presence here;

2.
For holy Thou indeed dost prove
The marriage vow to be,
Proclaiming it a type of love
Between the Church and Thee.

3.
The holiest vow that man can make,
The golden thread of life,
The bond that none may dare divide,
That bindeth man to wife.

4.
Which blest by Thee, whate'er betides,
No evil shall destroy,
Thro' careworn days each care divides,
And doubles ev'ry joy.

5.
On those who at Thine altar kneel,
O Lord, Thy blessing pour,
That each may wake the other's zeal
To love Thee more and more:

6.
Oh grant them here in peace to live,
In purity and love,
And, this world leaving, to receive
A crown of life above.
Amen.
