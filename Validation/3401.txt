 oneness of the unit. There is a difference between the oneness of a
 body and the oneness of a member of that body. The body is many, and a
 unity of manifold comprehensiveness. An arm or a member of a body is
 one, but that is the unity of singularity. Without unity my Christian
 brethren, peace must be impossible. There can be no peace in the one
 single soldier of an army. You do not speak of the harmony of one
 member of a body. There is peace in an army, or in a kingdom joined
 with other kingdoms; there is harmony in a member united with other
 members. There is no peace in a unit, there is no possibility of the
 harmony of that which is but one in itself. In order to have peace you
 must have a higher unity, and therein consists the unity of God's own
 Being. The unity of God is the basis of the peace of God--meaning by
 the unity of God the comprehensive manifoldness of God, and not merely
 the singularity in the number of God's Being. When the Unitarian
 speaks of God as one, he means simply singularity of number. We mean
 that He is of manifold comprehensiveness--that there is unity between
 His various powers. Amongst the personalities or powers of His Being
 there is no discord, but perfect harmony, entire union; and that
 brethren, is repose, the blessedness of infinite rest, that belongs to
 the unity of God--"I and my Father are one."

 The second thing which we observe respecting this unity, is that it
 subsists between things not similar or alike, but things dissimilar or
 unlike. There is no unity in the separate atoms of a sand-pit; they
 are things similar; there is an aggregate or collection of them. Even
 if they be hardened in a mass they are not one, they do not form a
 unity: they are simply a mass. There is no unity in a flock of sheep:
 it is simply a repetition of a number of things similar to each other.
 If you strike off from a thousand five hundred, or if you strike off
 nine hundred, there is nothing lost of unity, because there never was
 unity. A flock of one thousand or a flock of five is just as much a
 flock as any other number.

 On the other hand, let us turn to the unity of peace which the apostle
 speaks of, and we find it is something different; it is made up of
 dissimilar members, without which dissimilarity there could be no
 unity. Each is imperfect in itself, each supplying what it has in
 itself to the deficiencies and wants of the other members. So, if you
 strike off from this body any one member, if you cut off an arm, or
 tear out an eye, instantly the unity is destroyed; you have no longer
 an entire and perfect body, there is nothing but a remnant of the
 whole, a part, a portion; no unity whatever.

 This will help us to understand the unity of the Church of Christ. If
 the ages and the centuries of the Church of Christ, if the different
 Churches whereof it was composed, if the different members of each
 Church, were similar--one in this, that they all held the same views,
 all spoke the same words, all viewed truth from the same side, they
 would have no unity; but would simply be an aggregate of atoms, the
 sand-pit over again--units, multiplied it may be to infinity, but you
 would have no real unity, and therefore, no peace. No unity,--for
 wherein consists the unity of the Church of Christ? The unity of ages,
 brethren, consists it in this--that every age is merely the repetition
 of another age, and that which is held in one is held in another?
 Precisely in the same way, that is _not_ the unity of the ages of the
 Christian Church.

 Every century and every age has held a different truth, has put forth
 different fragments of the truth. In early ages for example, by
 martyrdom was proclaimed the eternal sanctity of truth, rather than
 give up which a man must lose his life.... In our own age it is quite
 plain those are not the themes which engage us, or the truths which we
 put in force now. This age, by its revolutions, its socialisms,
 proclaims another truth--the brotherhood of the Church of Christ; so
 that the unity of ages subsists on the same principle as that of the
 unity of the human body: and just as every separate ray--the violet,
 the blue, and the orange--make up the white ray, so these manifold
 fragments of truth blended together make up the one entire and perfect
 white ray of Truth. And with regard to individuals, taking the case of
 the Reformation, it was given to one Church to proclaim that salvation
 is a thing received, and not local; to another to proclaim
 justification by faith; to another the sovereignty of God; to another
 the supremacy of the Scriptures; to another the right of private
 judgment, the duty of the individual conscience. Unite these all, and
 then you have the Reformation one--one in spite of manifoldness; those
 very varieties by which they have approached this proving them to be
 one. Disjoint them and then you have some miserable sect--Calvinism,
 or Unitarianism; the unity has dispersed. And so again with the unity
 of the Churches. Whereby would we produce unity? Would we force on
 other Churches our Anglicanism? Would we have our thirty-nine
 articles, our creeds, our prayers, our rules and regulations, accepted
 by every Church throughout the world? If that were unity, then in
 consistency you are bound to demand that in God's world there shall be
 but one colour instead of the manifold harmony and accordance of which
 this universe is full; that there should be but one chaunted note--the
 one which we conceive most beautiful. This is not the unity of the
 Church of God. The various Churches advance different doctrines and
 truths. The Church of Germany something different from those of the
 Church of England. The Church of Rome, even in its idolatry, proclaims
 truths which we would be glad to seize. By the worship of the Virgin,
 the purity of women; by the rigour of ecclesiastical ordinances, the
 sanctity and permanence of eternal order; by the very priesthood
 itself, the necessity of the guidance of man by man. Nay, even the
 dissenting bodies themselves--mere atoms of aggregates as they
 are--stand forward and proclaim at least this truth, the separateness
 of the individual conscience, the right of independence.

 Peace subsists not between things exactly alike. We do not speak of
 peace in a single country. We say peace subsists between different
 countries where war _might_ be. There can be no _peace_ between two
 men who agree in everything; peace subsists between those who differ.
 There is no peace between Baptist and Baptist; so far as they are
 Baptists, there is perfect accordance and agreement. There may be
 peace between you and the Romanist, the Jew, or the Dissenter, because
 there are angles of sharpness which might come into collision if they
 were not subdued and softened by the power of love. It was given to
 the Apostle Paul to discern that this was the ground of unity. In the
 Church of Christ he saw men with different views, and he said So far
 from that variety destroying unity, it was the only ground of unity.
 There are many doctrines, all of them different, but let those
 varieties be blended together--in other words, let there be the peace
 of love, and then you will have unity.

 Once more this unity, whereof the apostle speaks, consists in
 submission to one single influence or spirit. Wherein consists the
 unity of the body? Consists it not in this,--that there is one life
 uniting, making all the separate members one? Take away the life, and
 the members fall to pieces: they are no longer one; decomposition
 begins, and every element separates, no longer having any principle of
 cohesion or union with the rest.

 There is not one of us who, at some time or other, has not been struck
 with the power there is in a single living influence. Have we never
 for instance, felt the power wherewith the orator unites and holds
 together a thousand men as if they were but one; with flashing eyes
 and throbbing hearts, all attentive to his words, and by the
 difference of their attitudes, by the variety of the expressions of
 their countenances testifying to the unity of that single living
 feeling with which he had inspired them? Whether it be indignation,
 whether it be compassion, or whether it be enthusiasm, that one living
 influence made the thousand for the time, one. Have we not heard how,
 even in this century in which we live, the various and conflicting
 feelings of the people of this country were concentrated into one,
 when the threat of foreign invasion had fused down and broken the
 edges of conflict and variance, and from shore to shore was heard one
 cry of terrible defiance, and the different classes and orders of this
 manifold and mighty England were as one? Have we not heard how the
 mighty winds hold together, as if one, the various atoms of the
 desert, so that they rush like a living thing, across the wilderness?
 And this, brethren, is the unity of the Church of Christ, the
 subjection to the one uniting spirit of its God.

 It will be said, in reply to this, "Why this is mere enthusiasm. It
 may be very beautiful in theory, but it is impossible in practice. It
 is mere enthusiasm to believe, that while all these varieties of
 conflicting opinion remain, we can have unity; it is mere enthusiasm
 to think that so long as men's minds reckon on a thing like unity,
 there can be a thing like oneness." And our reply is, Give us the
 Spirit of God, and we shall be one. You cannot produce a unity by all
 the rigour of your ecclesiastical discipline. You cannot produce a
 unity by consenting in some form of expression such as this, "Let us
 agree to differ." You cannot produce a unity by Parliamentary
 regulations or enactments, bidding back the waves of what is called
 aggression. Give us the living Spirit of God, and we shall be one.

 Once on this earth was exhibited, as it were, a specimen of perfect
 anticipation of such an unity, when the "rushing mighty wind" of
 Pentecost came down in the tongues of fire and sat on every man; when
 the Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in
 Mesopotamia, the "Cretes and Arabians," the Jew and the Gentile, each
 speaking one language, yet blended and fused into one unity by
 enthusiastic love, heard one another speak as it were, in one
 language, the manifold works of God; when the spirit of giving was
 substituted for the spirit of mere rivalry and competition, and no man
 said the things he had were his own, but all shared in common. Let
 that spirit come again, as come it will, and come it must; and then,
 beneath the influences of a mightier love, we shall have a nobler and
 a more real unity.


 We pass on now, in the second place, to consider the _individual
 peace_ resulting from this unity. As we have endeavoured to explain
 what is meant by unity, so now, let us endeavour to understand what is
 meant by peace. Peace then, is the opposite of passion, and of labour,
 toil, and effort. Peace is that state in which there are no desires
 madly demanding an impossible gratification; that state in which there
 is no misery, no remorse, no sting. And there are but three things
 which can break that peace. The first is discord between the mind of
 man and the lot which he is called on to inherit; the second is
 discord between the affections and powers of the soul; and the third
 is doubt of the rectitude, and justice, and love, wherewith this world
 is ordered. But where these things exist not, where a man is contented
 with his lot, where the flesh is subdued to the spirit, and where he
 believes and feels with all his heart that all is right, there is
 peace, and to this says the apostle, "ye are called,"--the grand,
 peculiar call of Christianity,--the call, "Come unto Me, all ye that
 labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."

 This was the dying bequest of Christ: "Peace I leave with you, my
 peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth give I unto you:" and
 therein lies one of the greatest truths of the blessed and eternal
 character of Christianity, that it applies to, and satisfies the very
 deepest want and craving of our nature. The deepest want of man is not
 a desire for happiness, but a craving for peace; not a wish for the
 gratification of every desire, but a craving for the repose of
 acquiescence in the will of God; and it is this which Christianity
 promises. Christianity does not promise happiness, but it does promise
 peace. "In the world ye shall have tribulation," saith our Master,
 "but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world." Now, let us look
 more closely, into this peace.

 The first thing we see respecting it is, that it is called God's
 peace. God is rest: the infinite nature of God is infinite repose. The
 "_I am_" of God is contrasted with the _I am become_ of all other
 things. Everything else is in a state of _becoming_, God is in a state
 of _Being_. The acorn has become the plant, and the plant has become
 the oak. The child has become the man, and the man has become good, or
 wise, or whatever else it may be. God ever _is_; and I pray you once
 more to observe, that this peace of God, this eternal rest in the
 Almighty Being, arises out of His unity. Not because He is an unit,
 but because He is an unity. There is no discord between the powers and
 attributes of the mind of God; there is no discord between His justice
 and His love; there is no discord demanding some miserable expedient
 to unite them together, such as some theologians imagined when they
 described the sacrifice and atonement of our Redeemer by saying, it is
 the clever expedient whereby God reconciles His justice with His love.
 God's justice and love are one. Infinite justice must be infinite
 love. Justice is but another sign of love. The infinite rest of the
 "_I am_" of God arises out of the harmony of His attributes.

 The next thing we observe respecting this divine peace which has come
 down to man on earth is, that it is a _living peace_. Brethren, let us
 distinguish. There are several things called peace which are by no
 means divine or Godlike peace. There is peace, for example, in the man
 who lives for and enjoys self, with no nobler aspiration goading him
 on to make him feel the rest of God; that is peace, but that is merely
 the peace of toil. There is rest on the surface of the caverned lake,
 which no wind can stir; but that is the peace of stagnation. There is
 peace amongst the stones which have fallen and rolled down the
 mountain's side, and lie there quietly at rest; but that is the peace
 of inanity. There is peace in the hearts of enemies who lie together,
 side by side, in the same trench of the battle-field, the animosities
 of their souls silenced at length, and their hands no longer clenched
 in deadly enmity against each other; but that is the peace of death.
 If our peace be but the peace of the sensualist satisfying pleasure,
 if it be but the peace of mental torpor and inaction, the peace of
 apathy, or the peace of the soul dead in trespasses and sins, we may
 whisper to ourselves, "Peace, peace," but there will be no peace;
 _there_ is not the peace of unity nor the peace of God, for the peace
 of God is the living peace of love.

 The next thing we observe respecting this peace is, that it is the
 manifestation of power--it is the peace which comes from an inward
 power: "Let the peace of God," says the Apostle, "rule within your
 hearts." For it is a power, the manifestation of strength. There is no
 peace except there is the possibility of the opposite of peace
 although now restrained and controlled. You do not speak of the peace
 of a grain of sand, because it cannot be otherwise than merely
 insignificant, and at rest. You do not speak of the peace of a mere
 pond; you speak of the peace of the sea, because there is the opposite
 of peace implied, there is power and strength. And this brethren, is
 the real character of the peace in the mind and soul of man. Oh! we
 make a great mistake when we say there is strength in passion, in the
 exhibition of emotion. Passion, and emotion, and all those outward
 manifestations, prove, not strength, but weakness. If the passions of
 a man are strong, it proves the man himself is weak, if he cannot
 restrain or control his passions. The real strength and majesty of the
 soul of man is calmness, the manifestation of strength; "the peace of
 God" ruling; the word of Christ saying to the inward storms "Peace!"
 and there is "a great calm."

 Lastly, the peace of which the apostle speaks is the peace that is
 received--the peace of reception. You will observe, throughout this
 passage the apostle speaks of a something received, and not done: "Let
 the peace of God rule in your hearts." It is throughout receptive, but
 by no means inactive. And according to this, there are two kinds of
 peace; the peace of obedience--"Let the peace of God rule" you--and
 there is the peace of gratefulness--"Be ye thankful." Very great,
 brethren, is the peace of obedience: when a man has his lot fixed, and
 his mind made up, and he sees his destiny before him, and quietly
 acquiesces in it; his spirit is at rest. Great and deep is the peace
 of the soldier to whom has been assigned even an untenable position,
 with the command, "Keep that, even if you die," and he obediently
 remains to die.

 Great was the peace of Elisha--very, very calm are those words by
 which he expressed his acquiescence in the divine will. "Knowest
 thou," said the troubled, excited, and restless men around
 him--"Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy
 head to-day?" He answered, "Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace." Then
 there is the other peace, it is the peace of gratefulness: "Be ye
 thankful." It is that peace which the Israelites had when these words
 were spoken to them on the shores of the Red Sea, while the bodies of
 their enemies floated past them, destroyed, but not by them: "Stand
 still and see the salvation of the Lord."

 And here brethren, is another mistake of ours: we look on salvation as
 a thing to be done, and not received. In God's salvation we can do but
 little, but there is a great deal to be received. We are here, not
 merely to act, but to be acted upon. "Let the peace of God rule in
 your hearts;" there is a peace that will enter there, if you do not
 thwart it; there is a Spirit that will take possession of your soul,
 provided that you do not quench it. In this world we are recipients,
 not creators. In obedience and in gratefulness, and the infinite peace
 of God in the soul of man, is alone to be found deep calm repose.

 THE CHRISTIAN AIM AND MOTIVE.

   "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven
    is perfect."--Matthew v. 48.


 There are two erroneous views held respecting the character of the
 Sermon on the Mount. The first may be called an error of
 worldly-minded men, the other an error of mistaken religionists.
 Worldly-minded men--men that is, in whom the devotional feeling is but
 feeble--are accustomed to look upon morality as the whole of religion;
 and they suppose that the Sermon on the Mount was designed only to
 explain and enforce correct principles of morality. It tells of human
 duties and human proprieties, and an attention to these, they
 maintain, is the only religion which is required by it. Strange my
 Christian brethren, that men, whose lives are least remarkable for
 superhuman excellence, should be the very men to refer most frequently
 to those sublime comments on Christian principle, and should so
