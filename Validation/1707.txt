Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
the official publication date.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net/pg
http://promo.net/pg

Those of you who want to download our Etexts before announcment
can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Or /etext00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding.

Something is needed to create a future for Project Gutenberg for
the next 100 years.

We need your donations more than ever!

The great principle of inheritance to be discussed in this chapter has been
recognised by agriculturists and authors of various nations, as shown by the
scientific term ATAVISM, derived from atavus, an ancestor; by the English
terms of REVERSION, or THROWING-BACK; by the French PAS-EN-ARRIERE; and by the
German RUCKSCHLAG, or RUCKSCHRITT. When the child resembles either grandparent
more closely than its immediate parents, our attention is not much arrested,
though in truth the fact is highly remarkable; but when the child resembles
some remote ancestor or some distant member in a collateral line,--and in the
last case we must attribute this to the descent of all the members from a
common progenitor,--we feel a just degree of astonishment. When one parent
alone displays some newly-acquired and generally inheritable character, and
the offspring do not inherit it, the cause may lie in the other parent having
the power of prepotent transmission. But when both parents are similarly
characterised, and the child does not, whatever the cause may be, inherit the
character in question, but resembles its grandparents, we have one of the
simplest cases of reversion. We continually see another and even more simple
case of atavism, though not generally included under this head, namely, when
the son more closely resembles his maternal than his paternal grand-sire in
some male attribute, as in any peculiarity in the beard of man, the horns of
the bull, the hackles or comb of the cock, or, as in certain diseases
necessarily confined to the male sex; for as the mother cannot possess or
exhibit such male attributes, the child must inherit them, through her blood,
from his maternal grandsire.

The cases of reversion may be divided into two main classes which, however, in
some instances, blend into one another; namely, first, those occurring in a
variety or race which has not been crossed, but has lost by variation some
character that it formerly possessed, and which afterwards reappears. The
second class includes all cases in which an individual with some
distinguishable character, a race, or species, has at some former period been
crossed, and a character derived from this cross, after having disappeared
during one or several generations, suddenly reappears. A third class,
differing only in the manner of reproduction, might be formed to include all
cases of reversion effected by means of buds, and therefore independent of
true or seminal generation. Perhaps even a fourth class might be instituted,
to include reversions by segments in the same individual flower or fruit, and
in different parts of the body in the same individual animal as it grows old.
But the two first main classes will be sufficient for our purpose.

REVERSION TO LOST CHARACTERS BY PURE OR UNCROSSED FORMS.

Striking instances of this first class of cases were given in the sixth
chapter, namely, of the occasional reappearance, in variously-coloured breeds
of the pigeon, of blue birds with all the marks characteristic of the wild
Columba livia. Similar cases were given in the case of the fowl. With the
common ass, as the legs of the wild progenitor are almost always striped, we
may feel assured that the occasional appearance of such stripes in the
domestic animal is a case of simple reversion. But I shall be compelled to
refer again to these cases, and therefore here pass them over.

The aboriginal species from which our domesticated cattle and sheep are
descended, no doubt possessed horns; but several hornless breeds are now well
established. Yet in these--for instance, in Southdown sheep--"it is not
unusual to find among the male lambs some with small horns." The horns, which
thus occasionally reappear in other polled breeds, either "grow to the full
size," or are curiously attached to the skin alone and hang "loosely down, or
drop off." (13/1. 'Youatt on Sheep' pages 20, 234. The same fact of loose
horns occasionally appearing in hornless breeds has been observed in Germany;
Bechstein 'Naturgesch. Deutschlands.' b. 1 s. 362.) The Galloways and Suffolk
cattle have been hornless for the last 100 or 150 years, but a horned calf,
with the horn often loosely attached, is occasionally produced. (13/2. 'Youatt
on Cattle' pages 155, 174.)

There is reason to believe that sheep in their early domesticated condition
were "brown or dingy black;" but even in the time of David certain flocks were
spoken of as white as snow. During the classical period the sheep of Spain are
described by several ancient authors as being black, red, or tawny. (13/3.
'Youatt on Sheep' 1838 pages 17, 145.) At the present day, notwithstanding the
great care which is taken to prevent it, particoloured lambs and some entirely
black are occasionally, or even frequently, dropped by our most highly
improved and valued breeds, such as the Southdowns. Since the time of the
famous Bakewell, during the last century, the Leicester sheep have been bred
with the most scrupulous care; yet occasionally grey-faced, or black-spotted,
or wholly black lambs appear. (13/4. I have been informed of this fact through
the Rev. W.D. Fox on the excellent authority of Mr. Wilmot: see also remarks
on this subject in an article in the 'Quarterly Review' 1849 page 395.) This
occurs still more frequently with the less improved breeds, such as the
Norfolks. (13/5. Youatt pages 19, 234.) As bearing on this tendency in sheep
to revert to dark colours, I may state (though in doing so I trench on the
reversion of crossed breeds, and likewise on the subject of prepotency) that
the Rev. W.D. Fox was informed that seven white Southdown ewes were put to a
so-called Spanish ram, which had two small black spots on his sides, and they
produced thirteen lambs, all perfectly black. Mr. Fox believes that this ram
belonged to a breed which he has himself kept, and which is always spotted
with black and white; and he finds that Leicester sheep crossed by rams of
this breed always produce black lambs: he has gone on recrossing these crossed
sheep with pure white Leicesters during three successive generations, but
always with the same result. Mr. Fox was also told by the friend from whom the
spotted breed was procured, that he likewise had gone on for six or seven
generations crossing with white sheep, but still black lambs were invariably
produced.

Similar facts could be given with respect to tailless breeds of various
animals. For instance, Mr. Hewitt (13/6. 'The Poultry Book' by Mr. Tegetmeier
1866 page 231.) states that chickens bred from some rumpless fowls, which were
reckoned so good that they won a prize at an exhibition, "in a considerable
number of instances were furnished with fully developed tail-feathers." On
inquiry, the original breeder of these fowls stated that, from the time when
he had first kept them, they had often produced fowls furnished with tails;
but that these latter would again reproduce rumpless chickens.

Analogous cases of reversion occur in the vegetable kingdom; thus "from seeds
gathered from the finest cultivated varieties of Heartsease (Viola tricolor),
plants perfectly wild both in their foliage and their flowers are frequently
produced;" (13/7. Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 10 1834 page 396: a
nurseryman, with much experience on this subject, has likewise assured me that
this sometimes occurs.) but the reversion in this instance is not to a very
ancient period, for the best existing varieties of the heartsease are of
comparatively modern origin. With most of our cultivated vegetables there is
some tendency to reversion to what is known to be, or may be presumed to be,
their aboriginal state; and this would be more evident if gardeners did not
generally look over their beds of seedlings, and pull up the false plants or
"rogues" as they are called. It has already been remarked, that some few
seedling apples and pears generally resemble, but apparently are not identical
with, the wild trees from which they are descended. In our turnip (13/8.
'Gardener's Chronicle' 1855 page 777.) and carrot-beds a few plants often
"break "--that is, flower too soon; and their roots are generally hard and
stringy, as in the parent-species. By the aid of a little selection, carried
on during a few generations, most of our cultivated plants could probably be
brought back, without any great change in their conditions of life, to a wild
or nearly wild condition: Mr. Buckman has effected this with the parsnip
(13/9. Ibid 1862 page 721.); and Mr. Hewett C. Watson, as he informs me,
selected, during three generations, "the most diverging plants of Scotch kail,
perhaps one of the least modified varieties of the cabbage; and in the third
generation some of the plants came very close to the forms now established in
England about old castle-walls, and called indigenous."

REVERSION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS WHICH HAVE RUN WILD.

In the cases hitherto considered, the reverting animals and plants have not
been exposed to any great or abrupt change in their conditions of life which
could have induced this tendency; but it is very different with animals and
plants which have become feral or run wild. It has been repeatedly asserted in
the most positive manner by various authors, that feral animals and plants
invariably return to their primitive specific type. It is curious on what
little evidence this belief rests. Many of our domesticated animals could not
subsist in a wild state; thus, the more highly improved breeds of the pigeon
will not "field" or search for their own food. Sheep have never become feral,
and would be destroyed by almost every beast of prey. (13/10. Mr. Boner speaks
('Chamois-hunting' 2nd edition 1860 page 92) of sheep often running wild in
the Bavarian Alps; but, on making further inquiries at my request, he found
that they are not able to establish themselves; they generally perish from the
frozen snow clinging to their wool, and they have lost the skill necessary to
pass over steep icy slopes. On one occasion two ewes survived the winter, but
their lambs perished.) In several cases we do not know the aboriginal parent-
species, and cannot possibly tell whether or not there has been any close
degree of reversion. It is not known in any instance what variety was first
turned out; several varieties have probably in some cases run wild, and their
crossing alone would tend to obliterate their proper character. Our
domesticated animals and plants, when they run wild, must always be exposed to
new conditions of life, for, as Mr. Wallace (13/11. See some excellent remarks
on this subject by Mr. Wallace 'Journal Proc. Linn. Soc.' 1858 volume 3 page
60.) has well remarked, they have to obtain their own food, and are exposed to
competition with the native productions. Under these circumstances, if our
domesticated animals did not undergo change of some kind, the result would be
quite opposed to the conclusions arrived at in this work. Nevertheless, I do
not doubt that the simple fact of animals and plants becoming feral, does
cause some tendency to reversion to the primitive state; though this tendency
has been much exaggerated by some authors.

[I will briefly run through the recorded cases. With neither horses nor cattle
is the primitive stock known; and it has been shown in former chapters that
they have assumed different colours in different countries. Thus the horses
which have run wild in South America are generally brownish-bay, and in the
East dun-coloured; their heads have become larger and coarser, and this may be
due to reversion. No careful description has been given of the feral goat.
Dogs which have run wild in various countries have hardly anywhere assumed a
uniform character; but they are probably descended from several domestic
races, and aboriginally from several distinct species. Feral cats, both in
Europe and La Plata, are regularly striped; in some cases they have grown to
an unusually large size, but do not differ from the domestic animal in any
other character. When variously-coloured tame rabbits are turned out in
Europe, they generally reacquire the colouring of the wild animal; there can
be no doubt that this does really occur, but we should remember that oddly-
coloured and conspicuous animals would suffer much from beasts of prey and
from being easily shot; this at least was the opinion of a gentleman who tried
to stock his woods with a nearly white variety; if thus destroyed, they would
be supplanted by, instead of being transformed into, the common rabbit. We
have seen that the feral rabbits of Jamaica, and especially of Porto Santo,
have assumed new colours and other new characters. The best known case of
reversion, and that on which the widely spread belief in its universality
apparently rests, is that of pigs. These animals have run wild in the West
Indies, South America, and the Falkland Islands, and have everywhere acquired
the dark colour, the thick bristles, and great tusks of the wild boar; and the
young have reacquired longitudinal stripes. But even in the case of the pig,
Roulin describes the half-wild animals in different parts of South America as
differing in several respects. In Louisiana the pig (13/12. Dureau de la Malle
'Comptes Rendus' tome 41 1855 page 807. From the statements above given, the
author concludes that the wild pigs of Louisiana are not descended from the
European Sus scrofa.) has run wild, and is said to differ a little in form,
and much in colour, from the domestic animal, yet does not closely resemble
the wild boar of Europe. With pigeons and fowls (13/13. Capt. W. Allen, in his
'Expedition to the Niger' states that fowls have run wild on the island of
Annobon, and have become modified in form and voice. The account is so meagre
and vague that it did not appear to me worth copying; but I now find that
