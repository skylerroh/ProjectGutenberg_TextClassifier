
"My work can wait; it is nearly finished," said Luke.

The ten minutes passed rapidly, and with a cordial good-bye,
the capitalist entered the train, leaving Luke to return to his
modest home in good spirits.

"I have two influential friends, now," he said to himself--"Mr.
Reed and Mr. Armstrong. On the whole, Luke Larkin, you are in luck,
your prospects look decidedly bright, even if you have lost the
janitorship."



CHAPTER XXIII

RANDOLPH AND HIS CREDITOR


Though Randolph was pleased at having, as he thought, put a spoke
in Luke's wheel, and filled Mr. Armstrong's mind with suspicion, he
was not altogether happy. He had a little private trouble of his
own. He had now for some time been a frequenter of Tony Denton's
billiard saloon, patronizing both the table and the bar. He had
fallen in with a few young men of no social standing, who flattered
him, and, therefore, stood in his good graces. With them he played
billiards and drank. After a time he found that he was exceeding
his allowance, but in the most obliging way Tony Denton had offered
him credit.

"Of course, Mr. Duncan"--Randolph felt flattered at being addressed
in this way--"of course, Mr. Duncan, your credit is good with me.
If you haven't the ready money, and I know most young gentlemen are
liable to be short, I will just keep an account, and you can settle
at your convenience."

This seemed very obliging, but I am disposed to think that a boy's
worst enemy is the one who makes it easy for him to run into debt.
Randolph was not wholly without caution, for he said: "But suppose,
Tony, I am not able to pay when you want the money?"

"Oh, don't trouble yourself about that, Mr. Duncan," said Tony
cordially. "Of course, I know the standing of your family, and I
am perfectly safe. Some time you will be a rich man."

"Yes, I suppose I shall," said Randolph, in a consequential tone.

"And it is worth something to me to have my saloon patronized
by a young gentleman of your social standing."

Evidently, Tony Denton understood Randolph's weak point, and played
on it skillfully. He assumed an air of extra consequence, as he
remarked condescendingly: "You are very obliging, Tony, and I shall
not forget it."

Tony Denton laughed in his sleeve at the boy's vanity, but his
manner was very respectful, and Randolph looked upon him as an
humble friend and admirer.

"He is a sensible man, Tony; he understands what is due to my
position," he said to himself.

After Denton's visit to New York with Prince Duncan, and the
knowledge which he then acquired about the president of the
Groveton Bank, he decided that the time had come to cut short
Randolph's credit with him. The day of reckoning always comes
in such cases, as I hope my young friends will fully understand.
Debt is much more easily contracted than liquidated, and this
Randolph found to his cost.

One morning he was about to start on a game of billiards, when
Tony Denton called him aside.

"I would like to speak a word to you, Mr. Duncan," he said smoothly.

"All right, Tony," said Randolph, in a patronizing tone. "What can
I do for you?"

"My rent comes due to-morrow, Mr. Duncan, and I should be glad if
you would pay me a part of your account. It has been running some
time--"

Randolph's jaw fell, and he looked blank.

"How much do I owe you?" he asked.

Tony referred to a long ledgerlike account-book, turned to a certain
page, and running his fingers down a long series of items, answered,
"Twenty-seven dollars and sixty cents."

"It can't be so much!" ejaculated Randolph, in dismay. "Surely you
have made a mistake!"

"You can look for yourself," said Tony suavely. "Just reckon it up;
I may have made a little mistake in the sum total."

Randolph looked over the items, but he was nervous, and the page
swam before his eyes. He was quite incapable of performing the
addition, simple as it was, in his then frame of mind.

"I dare say you have added it up all right," he said, after an
abortive attempt to reckon it up, "but I can hardly believe that
I owe you so much."

"'Many a little makes a mickle,' as we Scotch say," answered Tony
cheerfully. "However, twenty-seven dollars is a mere trifle to a
young man like you. Come, if you'll pay me to-night, I'll knock
off the sixty cents."

"It's quite impossible for me to do it," said Randolph, ill at ease.

"Pay me something on account--say ten dollars."

"I haven't got but a dollar and a quarter in my pocket."

"Oh, well, you know where to go for more money," said Tony, with
a wink. "The old gentleman's got plenty."

"I am not so sure about that--I mean that he is willing to pay
out. Of course, he's got plenty of money invested," added Randolph,
who liked to have it thought that his father was a great financial
magnate.

"Well, he can spare some for his son, I am sure."

"Can't you let it go for a little while longer, Tony?" asked
Randolph, awkwardly.

"Really, Mr. Duncan, I couldn't. I am a poor man, as you know, and
have my bills to pay."

"I take it as very disobliging, Tony; I sha'n't care to patronize
your place any longer," said Randolph, trying a new tack.

Tony Denton shrugged his shoulders.

"I only care for patrons who are willing to pay their bills,"
he answered significantly. "It doesn't pay me to keep my place
open free."

"Of course not; but I hope you are not afraid of me?"

"Certainly not. I am sure you will act honorably and pay your bills.
If I thought you wouldn't, I would go and see your father about it."

"No, you mustn't do that," said Randolph, alarmed. "He doesn't know
I come here."

"And he won't know from me, if you pay what you owe."

Matters were becoming decidedly unpleasant for Randolph. The
perspiration gathered on his brow. He didn't know what to do. That
his father would not give him money for any such purpose, he very
well knew, and he dreaded his finding out where he spent so many
of his evenings.

"Oh, don't trouble yourself about a trifle," said Tony smoothly.
"Just go up to your father, frankly, and tell him you want the
money."

"He wouldn't give me twenty-seven dollars," said Randolph gloomily.

"Then ask for ten, and I'll wait for the balance till next week."

"Can't you put it all off till next week?"

"No; I really couldn't, Mr. Duncan. What does it matter to you
this week, or next?"

Randolph wished to put off as long as possible the inevitable
moment, though he knew it would do him no good in the end. But
Tony Denton was inflexible--and he finally said: "Well, I'll make
the attempt, but I know I shall fail."

"That's all right; I knew you would look at it in the right light.
Now, go ahead and play your game."

"No, I don't want to increase my debt."

"Oh, I won't charge you for what you play this evening. Tony Denton
can be liberal as well as the next man. Only I have to collect money
to pay my bills."

Randolph didn't know that all this had been prearranged by the
obliging saloon-keeper, and that, in now pressing him, he had
his own object in view.

The next morning, Randolph took an opportunity to see his
father alone.

"Father," he said, "will you do me a favor?"

"What is it, Randolph?"

"Let me have ten dollars."

His father frowned.

"What do you want with ten dollars?" he asked.

"I don't like to go round without money in my pocket. It doesn't
look well for the son of a rich man."

"Who told you I was a rich man?" said his father testily.

"Why, you are, aren't you? Everybody in the village says so."

"I may, or may not, be rich, but I don't care to encourage my son
in extravagant habits. You say you have no money. Don't you have
your regular allowance?"

"It is only two dollars a week."

"Only two dollars a week!" repeated the father angrily. "Let me
tell you, young man, that when I was of your age I didn't have
twenty-five cents a week."

"That was long ago. People lived differently from what they do now."

"How did they?"

"They didn't live in any style."

"They didn't spend money foolishly, as they do now. I don't see for
my part what you can do with even two dollars a week."

"Oh, it melts away, one way or another. I am your only son, and
people expect me to spend money. It is expected of one in my
position."

"So you can. I consider two dollars a week very liberal."

"You'd understand better if you were a young fellow like me how
hard it is to get along on that."

"I don't want to understand," returned his father stoutly. "One
thing I understand, and that is, that the boys of the present day
are foolishly extravagant. Think of Luke Larkin! Do you think he
spends two dollars even in a month?"

"I hope you don't mean to compare me with a working boy like Luke?"
Randolph said scornfully.

"I am not sure but Luke would suit me better than you in some
respects."

"You are speaking of Luke," said Randolph, with a lucky thought.
"Well, even he, working boy as he is, has a better watch than I,
who am the son of the president of the Groveton Bank."

"Do you want the ten dollars to buy a better watch?" asked
Prince Duncan.

"Yes," answered Randolph, ready to seize on any pretext
for the sake of getting the money.

"Then wait till I go to New York again, and I will look at some
watches. I won't make any promise, but I may buy you one. I don't
care about Luke outshining you."

This by no means answered Randolph's purpose.

"Won't you let me go up to the city myself, father?" he asked.

"No, I prefer to rely upon my own judgment in a purchase
of that kind."

It had occurred to Randolph that he would go to the city, and
pretend on his return that he had bought a watch but had his pocket
picked. Of course, his father would give him more than ten dollars
for the purpose, and he could privately pay it over to Tony Denton.

But this scheme did not work, and he made up his mind at last that
he would have to tell Tony he must wait.

He did so. Tony Denton, who fully expected this, and, for reasons
of his own, did not regret it, said very little to Randolph, but
decided to go round and see Prince Duncan himself. It would give
him a chance to introduce the other and more important matter.

It was about this time that Linton's birthday-party took place.
Randolph knew, of course, that he would meet Luke, but he no longer
had the satisfaction of deriding his shabby dress. Our hero wore his
best suit, and showed as much ease and self-possession as Randolph
himself.

"What airs that boy Luke puts on!" ejaculated Randolph, in disgust.
"I believe he thinks he is my equal."

In this Randolph was correct. Luke certainly did consider himself
the social equal of the haughty Randolph, and the consciousness of
being well dressed made him feel at greater ease than at Florence
Grant's party. He had taken additional lessons in dancing from his
friend Linton, and, being quick to learn, showed no awkwardness on
the floor. Linton's parents, by their kind cordiality, contributed
largely to the pleasure of their son's guests, who at the end of the
evening unanimously voted the party a success.



CHAPTER XXIV

A COMMISSION FOR LUKE


Upon his return to the city, John Armstrong lost no time in sending
for Roland Reed. The latter, though rather surprised at the summons,
answered it promptly. When he entered the office of the old merchant
he found him sitting at his desk.

"Mr. Armstrong?" he said inquiringly.

"That's my name. You, I take it, are Roland Reed."

"Yes."

"No doubt you wonder why I sent for you," said Mr. Armstrong.

"Is it about the robbery of the Groveton Bank?"

"You have guessed it. You know, I suppose, that I am the owner
of the missing box of bonds?"

"So I was told. Have you obtained any clue?"

"I have not had time. I have only just returned from Europe. I
have done nothing except visit Groveton."

"What led you to send for me? Pardon my curiosity, but I can't
help asking."

"An interview with a protege of yours, Luke Larkin."

"You know that Luke was arrested on suspicion of being connected
with the robbery, though there are those who pay me the compliment
of thinking that I may have had something to do with it."

"I think you had as much to do with it as Luke Larkin," said
Armstrong, deliberately.

"I had--just as much," said Reed, with a smile. "Luke is a good
boy, Mr. Armstrong."

"I quite agree with you. If I had a son I should like him to
resemble Luke."

"Give me your hand on that, Mr. Armstrong," said Roland Reed,
impulsively. "Excuse my impetuosity, but I've taken a fancy to
that boy."

"There, then, we are agreed. Now, Mr. Reed, I will tell you why I
have taken the liberty of sending for you. From what Luke said, I
judged that you were a sharp, shrewd man of the world, and might
help me in this matter, which I confess puzzles me. You know the
particulars, and therefore, without preamble, I am going to ask
you whether you have any theory as regards this robbery. The box
hasn't walked off without help. Now, who took it from the bank?"

"If I should tell you my suspicion you might laugh at me."

"I will promise not to do that."

"Then I believe that Prince Duncan, president of the Groveton
Bank, could tell you, if he chose, what has become of the box."

"Extraordinary!" ejaculated John Armstrong.

"I supposed you would be surprised--probably indignant, if you are
a friend of Duncan--but, nevertheless, I adhere to my statement."

"You mistake the meaning of my exclamation. I spoke of it as
extraordinary, because the same suspicion has entered my mind,
though, I admit, without a special reason."

"I have a reason."

"May I inquire what it is?"

"I knew Prince Duncan when he was a young man, though he does not
know me now. In fact, I may as well admit that I was then known
by another name. He wronged me deeply at that time, being guilty
of a crime which he successfully laid upon my shoulders. No one in
Groveton--no one of his recent associates--knows the real nature
of the man as well as I do."

"You prefer not to go into particulars?"

"Not at present."

"At all events you can give me your advice. To suspect amounts to
little. We must bring home the crime to him. It is here that I
need your advice."

"I understand that the box contained government bonds."

"Yes."

"What were the denominations?"

"One ten thousand dollar bond, one five, and ten of one thousand
each."

"It seems to me they ought to be traced. I suppose, of course,
they were coupon, not registered."

"You are right. Had they been registered, I should have been at
no trouble, nor would the thief have reaped any advantage."

"If coupon, they are, of course, numbered. Won't that serve as
a clue, supposing an attempt is made to dispose of them?"

"You touch the weak point of my position. They are numbered, and
I had a list of the numbers, but that list has disappeared. It is
either lost or mislaid. Of course, I can't identify them."

"That is awkward. Wouldn't the banker of whom you bought them be
able to give you the numbers?"

"Yes, but I don't know where they were bought. I had at the time in
my employ a clerk and book-keeper, a steady-going and methodical man
of fifty-odd, who made the purchase, and no doubt has a list of the
numbers of the bonds."

"Then where is your difficulty?" asked Roland Reed, in surprise.
