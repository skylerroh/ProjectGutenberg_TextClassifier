
1 Mac 12:2
He sent letters also to the Lacedemonians, and to other
places, for the same purpose.

1 Mac 12:3
So they went unto Rome, and entered into the senate, and
said, Jonathan the high priest, and the people of the Jews, sent
us unto you, to the end ye should renew the friendship, which ye
had with them, and league, as in former time.

1 Mac 12:4
Upon this the Romans gave them letters unto the governors of
every place that they should bring them into the land of Judea
peaceably.

1 Mac 12:5
And this is the copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote to
the Lacedemonians:

1 Mac 12:6
Jonathan the high priest, and the elders of the nation, and
the priests, and the other of the Jews, unto the Lacedemonians
their brethren send greeting:

1 Mac 12:7
There were letters sent in times past unto Onias the high
priest from Darius, who reigned then among you, to signify that
ye are our brethren, as the copy here underwritten doth specify.

1 Mac 12:8
At which time Onias entreated the ambassador that was sent
honourably, and received the letters, wherein declaration was
made of the league and friendship.

1 Mac 12:9
Therefore we also, albeit we need none of these things, that
we have the holy books of scripture in our hands to comfort us,

1 Mac 12:10
Have nevertheless attempted to send unto you for the renewing
of brotherhood and friendship, lest we should become strangers
unto you altogether: for there is a long time passed since ye
sent unto us.

1 Mac 12:11
We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in our
feasts, and other convenient days, do remember you in the
sacrifices which we offer, and in our prayers, as reason is, and
as it becometh us to think upon our brethren:

1 Mac 12:12
And we are right glad of your honour.

1 Mac 12:13
As for ourselves, we have had great troubles and wars on
every side, forsomuch as the kings that are round about us have
fought against us.

1 Mac 12:14
Howbeit we would not be troublesome unto you, nor to others
of our confederates and friends, in these wars:

1 Mac 12:15
For we have help from heaven that succoureth us, so as we are
delivered from our enemies, and our enemies are brought under
foot.

1 Mac 12:16
For this cause we chose Numenius the son of Antiochus, and
Antipater he son of Jason, and sent them unto the Romans, to
renew the amity that we had with them, and the former league.

1 Mac 12:17
We commanded them also to go unto you, and to salute and to
deliver you our letters concerning the renewing of our
brotherhood.

1 Mac 12:18
Wherefore now ye shall do well to give us an answer thereto.

1 Mac 12:19
And this is the copy of the letters which Oniares sent.

1 Mac 12:20
Areus king of the Lacedemonians to Onias the high priest,
greeting:

1 Mac 12:21
It is found in writing, that the Lacedemonians and Jews are
brethren, and that they are of the stock of Abraham:

1 Mac 12:22
Now therefore, since this is come to our knowledge, ye shall
do well to write unto us of your prosperity.

1 Mac 12:23
We do write back again to you, that your cattle and goods are
our's, and our's are your's We do command therefore our
ambassadors to make report unto you on this wise.

1 Mac 12:24
Now when Jonathan heard that Demebius' princes were come to
fight against him with a greater host than afore,

1 Mac 12:25
He removed from Jerusalem, and met them in the land of
Amathis: for he gave them no respite to enter his country.

1 Mac 12:26
He sent spies also unto their tents, who came again, and told
him that they were appointed to come upon them in the night
season.

1 Mac 12:27
Wherefore so soon as the sun was down, Jonathan commanded his
men to watch, and to be in arms, that all the night long they
might be ready to fight: also he sent forth centinels round
about the host.

1 Mac 12:28
But when the adversaries heard that Jonathan and his men were
ready for battle, they feared, and trembled in their hearts, and
they kindled fires in their camp.

1 Mac 12:29
Howbeit Jonathan and his company knew it not till the
morning: for they saw the lights burning.

1 Mac 12:30
Then Jonathan pursued after them, but overtook them not: for
they were gone over the river Eleutherus.

1 Mac 12:31
Wherefore Jonathan turned to the Arabians, who were called
Zabadeans, and smote them, and took their spoils.

1 Mac 12:32
And removing thence, he came to Damascus, and so passed
through all the country,

1 Mac 12:33
Simon also went forth, and passed through the country unto
Ascalon, and the holds there adjoining, from whence he turned
aside to Joppa, and won it.

1 Mac 12:34
For he had heard that they would deliver the hold unto them
that took Demetrius' part; wherefore he set a garrison there to
keep it.

1 Mac 12:35
After this came Jonathan home again, and calling the elders
of the people together, he consulted with them about building
strong holds in Judea,

1 Mac 12:36
And making the walls of Jerusalem higher, and raising a great
mount between the tower and the city, for to separate it from
the city, that so it might be alone, that men might neither sell
nor buy in it.

1 Mac 12:37
Upon this they came together to build up the city, forasmuch
as part of the wall toward the brook on the east side was fallen
down, and they repaired that which was called Caphenatha.

1 Mac 12:38
Simon also set up Adida in Sephela, and made it strong with
gates and bars.

1 Mac 12:39
Now Tryphon went about to get the kingdom of Asia, and to
kill Antiochus the king, that he might set the crown upon his
own head.

1 Mac 12:40
Howbeit he was afraid that Jonathan would not suffer him, and
that he would fight against him; wherefore he sought a way how
to take Jonathan, that he might kill him. So he removed, and
came to Bethsan.

1 Mac 12:41
Then Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand men
chosen for the battle, and came to Bethsan.

1 Mac 12:42
Now when Tryphon saw Jonathan came with so great a force, he
durst not stretch his hand against him;

1 Mac 12:43
But received him honourably, and commended him unto all his
friends, and gave him gifts, and commanded his men of war to be
as obedient unto him, as to himself.

1 Mac 12:44
Unto Jonathan also he said, Why hast thou brought all this
people to so great trouble, seeing there is no war betwixt us?

1 Mac 12:45
Therefore send them now home again, and choose a few men to
wait on thee, and come thou with me to Ptolemais, for I will
give it thee, and the rest of the strong holds and forces, and
all that have any charge: as for me, I will return and depart:
for this is the cause of my coming.

1 Mac 12:46
So Jonathan believing him did as he bade him, and sent away
his host, who went into the land of Judea.

1 Mac 12:47
And with himself he retained but three thousand men, of whom
he sent two thousand into Galilee, and one thousand went with
him.

1 Mac 12:48
Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, they of
Ptolemais shut the gates and took him, and all them that came
with him they slew with the sword.

1 Mac 12:49
Then sent Tryphon an host of footmen and horsemen into
Galilee, and into the great plain, to destroy all Jonathan's
company.

1 Mac 12:50
But when they knew that Jonathan and they that were with him
were taken and slain, they encouraged one another; and went
close together, prepared to fight.

1 Mac 12:51
They therefore that followed upon them, perceiving that they
were ready to fight for their lives, turned back again.

1 Mac 12:52
Whereupon they all came into the land of Judea peaceably, and
there they bewailed Jonathan, and them that were with him, and
they were sore afraid; wherefore all Israel made great
lamentation.

1 Mac 12:53
Then all the heathen that were round about then sought to
destroy them: for said they, They have no captain, nor any to
help them: now therefore let us make war upon them, and take
away their memorial from among men.

1 Mac 13:1
Now when Simon heard that Tryphon had gathered together a
great host to invade the land of Judea, and destroy it,

1 Mac 13:2
And saw that the people was in great trembling and fear, he
went up to Jerusalem, and gathered the people together,

1 Mac 13:3
And gave them exhortation, saying, Ye yourselves know what
great things I, and my brethren, and my father's house, have
done for the laws and the sanctuary, the battles also and
troubles which we have seen.

1 Mac 13:4
By reason whereof all my brethren are slain for Israel's
sake, and I am left alone.

1 Mac 13:5
Now therefore be it far from me, that I should spare mine own
life in any time of trouble: for I am no better than my
brethren.

1 Mac 13:6
Doubtless I will avenge my nation, and the sanctuary, and our
wives, and our children: for all the heathen are gathered to
destroy us of very malice.

1 Mac 13:7
Now as soon as the people heard these words, their spirit
revived.

1 Mac 13:8
And they answered with a loud voice, saying, Thou shalt be
our leader instead of Judas and Jonathan thy brother.

1 Mac 13:9
Fight thou our battles, and whatsoever, thou commandest us,
that will we do.

1 Mac 13:10
So then he gathered together all the men of war, and made
haste to finish the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified it
round about.

1 Mac 13:11
Also he sent Jonathan the son of Absolom, and with him a
great power, to Joppa: who casting out them that were therein
remained there in it.

1 Mac 13:12
So Tryphon removed from Ptolemaus with a great power to
invade the land of Judea, and Jonathan was with him in ward.

1 Mac 13:13
But Simon pitched his tents at Adida, over against the plain.

1 Mac 13:14
Now when Tryphon knew that Simon was risen up instead of his
brother Jonathan, and meant to join battle with him, he sent
messengers unto him, saying,

1 Mac 13:15
Whereas we have Jonathan thy brother in hold, it is for money
that he is owing unto the king's treasure, concerning the
business that was committed unto him.

1 Mac 13:16
Wherefore now send an hundred talents of silver, and two of
his sons for hostages, that when he is at liberty he may not
revolt from us, and we will let him go.

1 Mac 13:17
Hereupon Simon, albeit he perceived that they spake
deceitfully unto him yet sent he the money and the children,
lest peradventure he should procure to himself great hatred of
the people:

1 Mac 13:18
Who might have said, Because I sent him not the money and the
children, therefore is Jonathan dead.

1 Mac 13:19
So he sent them the children and the hundred talents: howbeit
Tryphon dissembled neither would he let Jonathan go.

1 Mac 13:20
And after this came Tryphon to invade the land, and destroy
it, going round about by the way that leadeth unto Adora: but
Simon and his host marched against him in every place,
wheresoever he went.

1 Mac 13:21
Now they that were in the tower sent messengers unto Tryphon,
to the end that he should hasten his coming unto them by the
wilderness, and send them victuals.

1 Mac 13:22
Wherefore Tryphon made ready all his horsemen to come that
night: but there fell a very great snow, by reason whereof he
came not. So he departed, and came into the country of Galaad.

1 Mac 13:23
And when he came near to Bascama he slew Jonathan, who was
buried there.

1 Mac 13:24
Afterward Tryphon returned and went into his own land.

1 Mac 13:25
Then sent Simon, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother,
and buried them in Modin, the city of his fathers.

1 Mac 13:26
And all Israel made great lamentation for him, and bewailed
him many days.

1 Mac 13:27
Simon also built a monument upon the sepulchre of his father
and his brethren, and raised it aloft to the sight, with hewn
stone behind and before.

1 Mac 13:28
Moreover he set up seven pyramids, one against another, for
his father, and his mother, and his four brethren.

1 Mac 13:29
And in these he made cunning devices, about the which he set
great pillars, and upon the pillars he made all their armour for
a perpetual memory, and by the armour ships carved, that they
might be seen of all that sail on the sea.

1 Mac 13:30
This is the sepulchre which he made at Modin, and it standeth
yet unto this day.

1 Mac 13:31
Now Tryphon dealt deceitfully with the young king Antiochus,
and slew him.

1 Mac 13:32
And he reigned in his stead, and crowned himself king of
Asia, and brought a great calamity upon the land.

1 Mac 13:33
Then Simon built up the strong holds in Judea, and fenced
them about with high towers, and great walls, and gates, and
bars, and laid up victuals therein.

1 Mac 13:34
Moreover Simon chose men, and sent to king Demetrius, to the
end he should give the land an immunity, because all that
Tryphon did was to spoil.

1 Mac 13:35
Unto whom king Demetrius answered and wrote after this
manner:

1 Mac 13:36
King Demetrius unto Simon the high priest, and friend of
kings, as also unto the elders and nation of the Jews, sendeth
greeting:

1 Mac 13:37
The golden crown, and the scarlet robe, which ye sent unto
us, we have received: and we are ready to make a stedfast peace
with you, yea, and to write unto our officers, to confirm the
immunities which we have granted.

1 Mac 13:38
And whatsoever covenants we have made with you shall stand;
and the strong holds, which ye have builded, shall be your own.

1 Mac 13:39
As for any oversight or fault committed unto this day, we
forgive it, and the crown tax also, which ye owe us: and if
there were any other tribute paid in Jerusalem, it shall no more
be paid.

1 Mac 13:40
And look who are meet among you to be in our court, let then
be enrolled, and let there be peace betwixt us.

1 Mac 13:41
Thus the yoke of the heathen was taken away from Israel in
the hundred and seventieth year.

1 Mac 13:42
Then the people of Israel began to write in their instruments
and contracts, In the first year of Simon the high priest, the
governor and leader of the Jews.

1 Mac 13:43
In those days Simon camped against Gaza and besieged it round
about; he made also an engine of war, and set it by the city,
and battered a certain tower, and took it.

1 Mac 13:44
And they that were in the engine leaped into the city;
whereupon there was a great uproar in the city:

1 Mac 13:45
Insomuch as the people of the city rent their clothes, and
climbed upon the walls with their wives and children, and cried
with a loud voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace.

1 Mac 13:46
And they said, Deal not with us according to our wickedness,
but according to thy mercy.

1 Mac 13:47
So Simon was appeased toward them, and fought no more against
them, but put them out of the city, and cleansed the houses
wherein the idols were, and so entered into it with songs and
thanksgiving.

1 Mac 13:48
Yea, he put all uncleanness out of it, and placed such men
there as would keep the law, and made it stronger than it was
before, and built therein a dwellingplace for himself.

1 Mac 13:49
They also of the tower in Jerusalem were kept so strait, that
they could neither come forth, nor go into the country, nor buy,
nor sell: wherefore they were in great distress for want of
victuals, and a great number of them perished through famine.

1 Mac 13:50
Then cried they to Simon, beseeching him to be at one with
them: which thing he granted them; and when he had put them out
from thence, he cleansed the tower from pollutions:

1 Mac 13:51
And entered into it the three and twentieth day of the second
month in the hundred seventy and first year, with thanksgiving,
and branches of palm trees, and with harps, and cymbals, and
with viols, and hymns, and songs: because there was destroyed a
great enemy out of Israel.

1 Mac 13:52
He ordained also that that day should be kept every year with
gladness. Moreover the hill of the temple that was by the tower
he made stronger than it was, and there he dwelt himself with
his company.

1 Mac 13:53
And when Simon saw that John his son was a valiant man, he
made him captain of all the hosts; and he dwelt in Gazera.

1 Mac 14:1
Now in the hundred threescore and twelfth year king Demetrius
gathered his forces together, and went into Media to get him
help to fight against Tryphone.

1 Mac 14:2
But when Arsaces, the king of Persia and Media, heard that
Demetrius was entered within his borders, he sent one of his
princes to take him alive:

1 Mac 14:3
Who went and smote the host of Demetrius, and took him, and
brought him to Arsaces, by whom he was put in ward.

1 Mac 14:4
As for the land of Judea, that was quiet all the days of
Simon; for he sought the good of his nation in such wise, as
that evermore his authority and honour pleased them well.

1 Mac 14:5
And as he was honourable in all his acts, so in this, that he
took Joppa for an haven, and made an entrance to the isles of
the sea,

1 Mac 14:6
And enlarged the bounds of his nation, and recovered the
country,

1 Mac 14:7
And gathered together a great number of captives, and had the
dominion of Gazera, and Bethsura, and the tower, out of the
which he took all uncleaness, neither was there any that
resisted him.

1 Mac 14:8
Then did they till their ground in peace, and the earth gave
her increase, and the trees of the field their fruit.

1 Mac 14:9
The ancient men sat all in the streets, communing together of
good things, and the young men put on glorious and warlike
apparel.

1 Mac 14:10
He provided victuals for the cities, and set in them all
manner of munition, so that his honourable name was renowned
unto the end of the world.

1 Mac 14:11
He made peace in the land, and Israel rejoiced with great
joy:

1 Mac 14:12
For every man sat under his vine and his fig tree, and there
was none to fray them:

1 Mac 14:13
Neither was there any left in the land to fight against them:
yea, the kings themselves were overthrown in those days.

1 Mac 14:14
Moreover he strengthened all those of his people that were
brought low: the law he searched out; and every contemner of the
law and wicked person he took away.

1 Mac 14:15
He beautified the sanctuary, and multiplied vessels of the
temple.

1 Mac 14:16
Now when it was heard at Rome, and as far as Sparta, that
Jonathan was dead, they were very sorry.

1 Mac 14:17
But as soon as they heard that his brother Simon was made
high priest in his stead, and ruled the country, and the cities
therein:

1 Mac 14:18
They wrote unto him in tables of brass, to renew the
friendship and league which they had made with Judas and
Jonathan his brethren:

1 Mac 14:19
Which writings were read before the congregation at
Jerusalem.

1 Mac 14:20
And this is the copy of the letters that the Lacedemonians
sent; The rulers of the Lacedemonians, with the city, unto Simon
the high priest, and the elders, and priests, and residue of the
people of the Jews, our brethren, send greeting:

1 Mac 14:21
The ambassadors that were sent unto our people certified us
of your glory and honour: wherefore we were glad of their
coming,

1 Mac 14:22
And did register the things that they spake in the council of
the people in this manner; Numenius son of Antiochus, and
Antipater son of Jason, the Jews' ambassadors, came unto us to
renew the friendship they had with us.

1 Mac 14:23
And it pleased the people to entertain the men honourably,
and to put the copy of their ambassage in publick records, to
the end the people of the Lacedemonians might have a memorial
thereof: furthermore we have written a copy thereof unto Simon
the high priest.

1 Mac 14:24
After this Simon sent Numenius to Rome with a great shield of
gold of a thousand pound weight to confirm the league with them.

1 Mac 14:25
Whereof when the people heard, they said, What thanks shall
we give to Simon and his sons?

1 Mac 14:26
For he and his brethren and the house of his father have
established Israel, and chased away in fight their enemies from
them, and confirmed their liberty.

1 Mac 14:27
So then they wrote it in tables of brass, which they set upon
pillars in mount Sion: and this is the copy of the writing; The
eighteenth day of the month Elul, in the hundred threescore and
twelfth year, being the third year of Simon the high priest,

1 Mac 14:28
At Saramel in the great congregation of the priests, and
people, and rulers of the nation, and elders of the country,
were these things notified unto us.

1 Mac 14:29
Forasmuch as oftentimes there have been wars in the country,
wherein for the maintenance of their sanctuary, and the law,
Simon the son of Mattathias, of the posterity of Jarib, together
with his brethren, put themselves in jeopardy, and resisting the
enemies of their nation did their nation great honour:

1 Mac 14:30
(For after that Jonathan, having gathered his nation
together, and been their high priest, was added to his people,

1 Mac 14:31
Their enemies prepared to invade their country, that they
might destroy it, and lay hands on the sanctuary:

1 Mac 14:32
At which time Simon rose up, and fought for his nation, and
spent much of his own substance, and armed the valiant men of
his nation and gave them wages,

1 Mac 14:33
And fortified the cities of Judea, together with Bethsura,
that lieth upon the borders of Judea, where the armour of the
enemies had been before; but he set a garrison of Jews there:

1 Mac 14:34
Moreover he fortified Joppa, which lieth upon the sea, and
Gazera, that bordereth upon Azotus, where the enemies had dwelt
before: but he placed Jews there, and furnished them with all
things convenient for the reparation thereof.)

1 Mac 14:35
The people therefore sang the acts of Simon, and unto what
glory he thought to bring his nation, made him their governor
and chief priest, because he had done all these things, and for
the justice and faith which he kept to his nation, and for that
he sought by all means to exalt his people.

1 Mac 14:36
For in his time things prospered in his hands, so that the
heathen were taken out of their country, and they also that were
in the city of David in Jerusalem, who had made themselves a
tower, out of which they issued, and polluted all about the
sanctuary, and did much hurt in the holy place:

1 Mac 14:37
But he placed Jews therein, and fortified it for the safety
of the country and the city, and raised up the walls of
Jerusalem.

1 Mac 14:38
King Demetrius also confirmed him in the high priesthood
according to those things,

1 Mac 14:39
And made him one of his friends, and honoured him with great
honour.

1 Mac 14:40
For he had heard say, that the Romans had called the Jews
their friends and confederates and brethren; and that they had
entertained the ambassadors of Simon honourably;

1 Mac 14:41
Also that the Jews and priests were well pleased that Simon
should be their governor and high priest for ever, until there
should arise a faithful prophet;

1 Mac 14:42
Moreover that he should be their captain, and should take
charge of the sanctuary, to set them over their works, and over
the country, and over the armour, and over the fortresses, that,
I say, he should take charge of the sanctuary;

1 Mac 14:43
Beside this, that he should be obeyed of every man, and that
all the writings in the country should be made in his name, and
that he should be clothed in purple, and wear gold:

1 Mac 14:44
Also that it should be lawful for none of the people or
priests to break any of these things, or to gainsay his words,
or to gather an assembly in the country without him, or to be
clothed in purple, or wear a buckle of gold;

1 Mac 14:45
And whosoever should do otherwise, or break any of these
things, he should be punished.

1 Mac 14:46
Thus it liked all the people to deal with Simon, and to do as
hath been said.

1 Mac 14:47
Then Simon accepted hereof, and was well pleased to be high
priest, and captain and governor of the Jews and priests, and to
defend them all.

1 Mac 14:48
So they commanded that this writing should be put in tables
of brass, and that they should be set up within the compass of
the sanctuary in a conspicuous place;

1 Mac 14:49
Also that the copies thereof should be laid up in the
treasury, to the end that Simon and his sons might have them.

1 Mac 15:1
Moreover Antiochus son of Demetrius the king sent letters
from the isles of the sea unto Simon the priest and prince of
the Jews, and to all the people;

1 Mac 15:2
The contents whereof were these: King Antiochus to Simon the
high priest and prince of his nation, and to the people of the
Jews, greeting:

1 Mac 15:3
Forasmuch as certain pestilent men have usurped the kingdom
of our fathers, and my purpose is to challenge it again, that I
may restore it to the old estate, and to that end have gathered
a multitude of foreign soldiers together, and prepared ships of
war;

1 Mac 15:4
My meaning also being to go through the country, that I may
be avenged of them that have destroyed it, and made many cities
in the kingdom desolate:

1 Mac 15:5
Now therefore I confirm unto thee all the oblations which the
kings before me granted thee, and whatsoever gifts besides they
granted.

1 Mac 15:6
I give thee leave also to coin money for thy country with
thine own stamp.

1 Mac 15:7
And as concerning Jerusalem and the sanctuary, let them be
free; and all the armour that thou hast made, and fortresses
that thou hast built, and keepest in thine hands, let them
remain unto thee.

1 Mac 15:8
And if anything be, or shall be, owing to the king, let it be
forgiven thee from this time forth for evermore.

1 Mac 15:9
Furthermore, when we have obtained our kingdom, we will
honour thee, and thy nation, and thy temple, with great honour,
so that your honour shall be known throughout the world.

1 Mac 15:10
In the hundred threescore and fourteenth year went Antiochus
into the land of his fathers: at which time all the forces came
together unto him, so that few were left with Tryphon.

1 Mac 15:11
Wherefore being pursued by king Antiochus, he fled unto Dora,
which lieth by the sea side:

1 Mac 15:12
For he saw that troubles came upon him all at once, and that
his forces had forsaken him.

1 Mac 15:13
Then camped Antiochus against Dora, having with him an
hundred and twenty thousand men of war, and eight thousand
horsemen.

1 Mac 15:14
And when he had compassed the city round about, and joined
ships close to the town on the sea side, he vexed the city by
land and by sea, neither suffered he any to go out or in.

1 Mac 15:15
In the mean season came Numenius and his company from Rome,
having letters to the kings and countries; wherein were written
these things:

1 Mac 15:16
Lucius, consul of the Romans unto king Ptolemee, greeting:

1 Mac 15:17
The Jews' ambassadors, our friends and confederates, came
unto us to renew the old friendship and league, being sent from
Simon the high priest, and from the people of the Jews:

1 Mac 15:18
And they brought a shield of gold of a thousand pound.

1 Mac 15:19
We thought it good therefore to write unto the kings and
countries, that they should do them no harm, nor fight against
them, their cities, or countries, nor yet aid their enemies
against them.

1 Mac 15:20
It seemed also good to us to receive the shield of them.

1 Mac 15:21
If therefore there be any pestilent fellows, that have fled
from their country unto you, deliver them unto Simon the high
priest, that he may punish them according to their own law.

1 Mac 15:22
The same things wrote he likewise unto Demetrius the king,
and Attalus, to Ariarathes, and Arsaces,

1 Mac 15:23
And to all the countries and to Sampsames, and the
Lacedemonians, and to Delus, and Myndus, and Sicyon, and Caria,
and Samos, and Pamphylia, and Lycia, and Halicarnassus, and
Rhodus, and Aradus, and Cos, and Side, and Aradus, and Gortyna,
and Cnidus, and Cyprus, and Cyrene.

1 Mac 15:24
And the copy hereof they wrote to Simon the high priest.

1 Mac 15:25
So Antiochus the king camped against Dora the second day,
assaulting it continually, and making engines, by which means he
shut up Tryphon, that he could neither go out nor in.

1 Mac 15:26
At that time Simon sent him two thousand chosen men to aid
him; silver also, and gold, and much armour.

1 Mac 15:27
Nevertheless he would not receive them, but brake all the
covenants which he had made with him afore, and became strange
unto him.

1 Mac 15:28
Furthermore he sent unto him Athenobius, one of his friends,
to commune with him, and say, Ye withhold Joppa and Gazera; with
the tower that is in Jerusalem, which are cities of my realm.

1 Mac 15:29
The borders thereof ye have wasted, and done great hurt in
the land, and got the dominion of many places within my kingdom.

1 Mac 15:30
Now therefore deliver the cities which ye have taken, and the
tributes of the places, whereof ye have gotten dominion without
the borders of Judea:

1 Mac 15:31
Or else give me for them five hundred talents of silver; and
for the harm that ye have done, and the tributes of the cities,
other five hundred talents: if not, we will come and fight
against you

1 Mac 15:32
So Athenobius the king's friend came to Jerusalem: and when
he saw the glory of Simon, and the cupboard of gold and silver
plate, and his great attendance, he was astonished, and told him
the king's message.

1 Mac 15:33
Then answered Simon, and said unto him, We have neither taken
other men's land, nor holden that which appertaineth to others,
but the inheritance of our fathers, which our enemies had
wrongfully in possession a certain time.

1 Mac 15:34
Wherefore we, having opportunity, hold the inheritance of our
fathers.
