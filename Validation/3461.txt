
1 Esdr 4:56
And he commanded to give to all that kept the city pensions and wages.

1 Esdr 4:57
He sent away also all the vessels from Babylon, that Cyrus had set
apart; and all that Cyrus had given in commandment, the same charged
he also to be done, and sent unto Jerusalem.

1 Esdr 4:58
Now when this young man was gone forth, he lifted up his face
to heaven toward Jerusalem, and praised the King of heaven,

1 Esdr 4:59
And said, From thee cometh victory, from thee cometh wisdom,
and thine is the glory, and I am thy servant.

1 Esdr 4:60
Blessed art thou, who hast given me wisdom: for to thee I give
thanks, O Lord of our fathers.

1 Esdr 4:61
And so he took the letters, and went out, and came unto Babylon, and
told it all his brethren.

1 Esdr 4:62
And they praised the God of their fathers, because he had given
them freedom and liberty

1 Esdr 4:63
To go up, and to build Jerusalem, and the temple which is called
by his name: and they feasted with instruments of musick and
gladness seven days.

1 Esdr 5:1
After this were the principal men of the families chosen according
to their tribes, to go up with their wives and sons and daughters,
with their menservants and maidservants, and their cattle.

1 Esdr 5:2
And Darius sent with them a thousand horsemen, till they had brought
them back to Jerusalem safely, and with musical [instruments] tabrets
and flutes.

1 Esdr 5:3
And all their brethren played, and he made them go up together with them.

1 Esdr 5:4
And these are the names of the men which went up, according
to their families among their tribes, after their several heads.

1 Esdr 5:5
The priests, the sons of Phinees the son of Aaron: Jesus the
son of Josedec, the son of Saraias, and Joacim the son of Zorobabel,
the son of Salathiel, of the house of David, out of the kindred
of Phares, of the tribe of Judah;

1 Esdr 5:6
Who spake wise sentences before Darius the king of Persia in the
second year of his reign, in the month Nisan, which is the
first month.

1 Esdr 5:7
And these are they of Jewry that came up from the captivity, where
they dwelt as strangers, whom Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon
had carried away unto Babylon.

1 Esdr 5:8
And they returned unto Jerusalem, and to the other parts of Jewry,
every man to his own city, who came with Zorobabel, with Jesus,
Nehemias, and Zacharias, and Reesaias, Enenius, Mardocheus, Beelsarus,
Aspharasus, Reelius, Roimus, and Baana, their guides.

1 Esdr 5:9

1 Esdr 5:28
The porters: the sons of Salum, the sons of Jatal, the sons of
Talmon, the sons of Dacobi, the sons of Teta, the sons of Sami,
in all an hundred thirty and nine.

1 Esdr 5:29
The servants of the temple: the sons of Esau, the sons of Asipha,
the sons of Tabaoth, the sons of Ceras, the sons of Sud, the sons
of Phaleas, the sons of Labana, the sons of Graba,

1 Esdr 5:30
The sons of Acua, the sons of Uta, the sons of Cetab, the sons of
Agaba, the sons of Subai, the sons of Anan, the sons of Cathua,
the sons of Geddur,

1 Esdr 5:31

of Phinees, the sons of Azare, the sons of Bastai, the sons of

the sons of Acipha, the sons of Assur, the sons of Pharacim, the
sons of Basaloth,

1 Esdr 5:32
The sons of Meeda, the sons of Coutha, the sons of Charea, the sons
of Charcus, the sons of Aserer, the sons of Thomoi, the sons of
Nasith, the sons of Atipha.

1 Esdr 5:33
The sons of the servants of Solomon: the sons of Azaphion, the sons
of Pharira, the sons of Jeeli, the sons of Lozon, the sons of
Israel, the sons of Sapheth,

1 Esdr 5:34
The sons of Hagia, the sons of Pharacareth, the sons of Sabi,
the sons of Sarothie, the sons of Masias, the sons of Gar,
the sons of Addus, the sons of Suba, the sons of Apherra, the
sons of Barodis, the sons of Sabat, the sons of Allom.

1 Esdr 5:35
All the ministers of the temple, and the sons of the servants
of Solomon, were three hundred seventy and two.

1 Esdr 5:36
These came up from Thermeleth and Thelersas, Charaathalar leading
them, and Aalar;

1 Esdr 5:37
Neither could they shew their families, nor their stock, how
they were of Israel: the sons of Ladan, the son of Ban, the sons
of Necodan, six hundred fifty and two.

1 Esdr 5:38
And of the priests that usurped the office of the priesthood,
and were not found: the sons of Obdia, the sons of Accoz, the
sons of Addus, who married Augia one of the daughters of Barzelus,
and was named after his name.

1 Esdr 5:39
And when the description of the kindred of these men was sought
in the register, and was not found, they were removed from executing
the office of the priesthood:

1 Esdr 5:40
For unto them said Nehemias and Atharias, that they should not be
partakers of the holy things, till there arose up an high priest
clothed with doctrine and truth.

1 Esdr 5:41
So of Israel, from them of twelve years old and upward, they were
all in number forty thousand, beside menservants and womenservants
two thousand three hundred and sixty.

1 Esdr 5:42
Their menservants and handmaids were seven thousand three hundred
forty and seven: the singing men and singing women, two hundred
forty and five:

1 Esdr 5:43
Four hundred thirty and five camels, seven thousand thirty and
six horses, two hundred forty and five mules, five thousand
five hundred twenty and five beasts used to the yoke.

1 Esdr 5:44
And certain of the chief of their families, when they came to
the temple of God that is in Jerusalem, vowed to set up the
house again in his own place according to their ability,

1 Esdr 5:45
And to give into the holy treasury of the works a thousand pounds
of gold, five thousand of silver, and an hundred priestly vestments.

1 Esdr 5:46
And so dwelt the priests and the Levites and the people in Jerusalem,
and in the country, the singers also and the porters; and all Israel
in their villages.

1 Esdr 5:47
But when the seventh month was at hand, and when the children of
Israel were every man in his own place, they came all together
with one consent into the open place of the first gate which is
toward the east.

1 Esdr 5:48
Then stood up Jesus the son of Josedec, and his brethren the
priests and Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and his brethren,
and made ready the altar of the God of Israel,

1 Esdr 5:49
To offer burnt sacrifices upon it, according as it is expressly
commanded in the book of Moses the man of God.

1 Esdr 5:50
And there were gathered unto them out of the other nations of
the land, and they erected the altar upon his own place, because
all the nations of the land were at enmity with them, and oppressed
them; and they offered sacrifices according to the time, and burnt
offerings to the Lord both morning and evening.

1 Esdr 5:51
Also they held the feast of tabernacles, as it is commanded in
the law, and offered sacrifices daily, as was meet:

1 Esdr 5:52
And after that, the continual oblations, and the sacrifice of
the sabbaths, and of the new moons, and of all holy feasts.

1 Esdr 5:53
And all they that had made any vow to God began to offer sacrifices
to God from the first day of the seventh month, although the temple
of the Lord was not yet built.

1 Esdr 5:54
And they gave unto the masons and carpenters money, meat, and drink,
with cheerfulness.

1 Esdr 5:55
Unto them of Zidon also and Tyre they gave carrs, that they should
bring cedar trees from Libanus, which should be brought by floats
to the haven of Joppa, according as it was commanded them by Cyrus
king of the Persians.

1 Esdr 5:56
And in the second year and second month after his coming to the
temple of God at Jerusalem began Zorobabel the son of Salathiel,
and Jesus the son of Josedec, and their brethren, and the priests,
and the Levites, and all they that were come unto Jerusalem out
of the captivity:

1 Esdr 5:57
And they laid the foundation of the house of God in the first
day of the second month, in the second year after they were come
to Jewry and Jerusalem.

1 Esdr 5:58
And they appointed the Levites from twenty years old over the
works of the Lord. Then stood up Jesus, and his sons and brethren,
and Cadmiel his brother, and the sons of Madiabun, with the sons
of Joda the son of Eliadun, with their sons and brethren, all
Levites, with one accord setters forward of the business, labouring
to advance the works in the house of God. So the workmen built
the temple of the Lord.

1 Esdr 5:59
And the priests stood arrayed in their vestments with musical
instruments and trumpets; and the Levites the sons of Asaph had
cymbals,

1 Esdr 5:60
Singing songs of thanksgiving, and praising the Lord, according as
David the king of Israel had ordained.

1 Esdr 5:61
And they sung with loud voices songs to the praise of the Lord,
because his mercy and glory is for ever in all Israel.

1 Esdr 5:62
And all the people sounded trumpets, and shouted with a loud voice,
singing songs of thanksgiving unto the Lord for the rearing up
of the house of the Lord.

1 Esdr 5:63
Also of the priests and Levites, and of the chief of their families,
the ancients who had seen the former house came to the building of
this with weeping and great crying.

1 Esdr 5:64
But many with trumpets and joy shouted with loud voice,

1 Esdr 5:65
Insomuch that the trumpets might not be heard for the weeping
of the people: yet the multitude sounded marvellously, so that
it was heard afar off.

1 Esdr 5:66
Wherefore when the enemies of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin
heard it, they came to know what that noise of trumpets should
mean.

1 Esdr 5:67
And they perceived that they that were of the captivity did
build the temple unto the Lord God of Israel.

1 Esdr 5:68
So they went to Zorobabel and Jesus, and to the chief of the
families, and said unto them, We will build together with you.

1 Esdr 5:69
For we likewise, as ye, do obey your Lord, and do sacrifice
unto him from the days of Azbazareth the king of the Assyrians,
who brought us hither.

1 Esdr 5:70
Then Zorobabel and Jesus and the chief of the families of Israel
said unto them, It is not for us and you to build together an
house unto the Lord our God.

1 Esdr 5:71
We ourselves alone will build unto the Lord of Israel, according
as Cyrus the king of the Persians hath commanded us.

1 Esdr 5:72
But the heathen of the land lying heavy upon the inhabitants
of Judea, and holding them strait, hindered their building;

1 Esdr 5:73
And by their secret plots, and popular persuasions and commotions,
they hindered the finishing of the building all the time that king
Cyrus lived: so they were hindered from building for the space
of two years, until the reign of Darius.

1 Esdr 6:1
Now in the second year of the reign of Darius Aggeus and Zacharias
the son of Addo, the prophets, prophesied unto the Jews in Jewry
and Jerusalem in the name of the Lord God of Israel, which was
upon them.

1 Esdr 6:2
Then stood up Zorobabel the son of Salatiel, and Jesus the son
of Josedec, and began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem,
the prophets of the Lord being with them, and helping them.

1 Esdr 6:3
At the same time came unto them Sisinnes the governor of Syria
and Phenice, with Sathrabuzanes and his companions, and said
unto them,

1 Esdr 6:4
By whose appointment do ye build this house and this roof, and
perform all the other things? and who are the workmen that perform
these things?

1 Esdr 6:5
Nevertheless the elders of the Jews obtained favour, because the
Lord had visited the captivity;

1 Esdr 6:6
And they were not hindered from building, until such time as
signification was given unto Darius concerning them, and an
answer received.

1 Esdr 6:7
The copy of the letters which Sisinnes, governor of Syria and
Phenice, and Sathrabuzanes, with their companions, rulers in
Syria and Phenice, wrote and sent unto Darius; To king Darius,
greeting:

1 Esdr 6:8
Let all things be known unto our lord the king, that being come
into the country of Judea, and entered into the city of Jerusalem
we found in the city of Jerusalem the ancients of the Jews that
were of the captivity

1 Esdr 6:9
Building an house unto the Lord, great and new, of hewn and
costly stones, and the timber already laid upon the walls.

1 Esdr 6:10
And those works are done with great speed, and the work goeth
on prosperously in their hands, and with all glory and diligence
is it made.

1 Esdr 6:11
Then asked we these elders, saying, By whose commandment build
ye this house, and lay the foundations of these works?

1 Esdr 6:12
Therefore to the intent that we might give knowledge unto thee
by writing, we demanded of them who were the chief doers, and
we required of them the names in writing of their principal men.

1 Esdr 6:13
So they gave us this answer, We are the servants of the Lord
which made heaven and earth.

1 Esdr 6:14
And as for this house, it was builded many years ago by a king of
Israel great and strong, and was finished.

1 Esdr 6:15
But when our fathers provoked God unto wrath, and sinned against
the Lord of Israel which is in heaven, he gave them over into
the power of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, of the Chaldees;

1 Esdr 6:16
Who pulled down the house, and burned it, and carried away the
people captives unto Babylon.

1 Esdr 6:17
But in the first year that king Cyrus reigned over the country
of Babylon Cyrus the king wrote to build up this house.

1 Esdr 6:18
And the holy vessels of gold and of silver, that Nabuchodonosor
had carried away out of the house at Jerusalem, and had set them
in his own temple those Cyrus the king brought forth again out
of the temple at Babylon, and they were delivered to Zorobabel
and to Sanabassarus the ruler,

1 Esdr 6:19
With commandment that he should carry away the same vessels,
and put them in the temple at Jerusalem; and that the temple of
the Lord should be built in his place.

1 Esdr 6:20
Then the same Sanabassarus, being come hither, laid the foundations
of the house of the Lord at Jerusalem; and from that time to this
being still a building, it is not yet fully ended.

1 Esdr 6:21
Now therefore, if it seem good unto the king, let search be made
among the records of king Cyrus:

1 Esdr 6:22
And if it be found that the building of the house of the Lord
at Jerusalem hath been done with the consent of king Cyrus, and
if our lord the king be so minded, let him signify unto us thereof.

1 Esdr 6:23
Then commanded king Darius to seek among the records at Babylon:
and so at Ecbatane the palace, which is in the country of Media,
there was found a roll wherein these things were recorded.

1 Esdr 6:24
In the first year of the reign of Cyrus king Cyrus commanded
that the house of the Lord at Jerusalem should be built again,
where they do sacrifice with continual fire:

1 Esdr 6:25
Whose height shall be sixty cubits and the breadth sixty cubits,
with three rows of hewn stones, and one row of new wood of that
country; and the expences thereof to be given out of the house
of king Cyrus:

1 Esdr 6:26
And that the holy vessels of the house of the Lord, both of
gold and silver, that Nabuchodonosor took out of the house at
Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, should be restored to the
house at Jerusalem, and be set in the place where they were
before.

1 Esdr 6:27
And also he commanded that Sisinnes the governor of Syria and
Phenice, and Sathrabuzanes, and their companions, and those
which were appointed rulers in Syria and Phenice, should be
careful not to meddle with the place, but suffer Zorobabel, the
servant of the Lord, and governor of Judea, and the elders of
the Jews, to build the house of the Lord in that place.

1 Esdr 6:28
I have commanded also to have it built up whole again; and
that they look diligently to help those that be of the captivity
of the Jews, till the house of the Lord be finished:

1 Esdr 6:29
And out of the tribute of Celosyria and Phenice a portion carefully
to be given these men for the sacrifices of the Lord, that is,
to Zorobabel the governor, for bullocks, and rams, and lambs;

1 Esdr 6:30
And also corn, salt, wine, and oil, and that continually every
year without further question, according as the priests that be
in Jerusalem shall signify to be daily spent:

1 Esdr 6:31
That offerings may be made to the most high God for the king
and for his children, and that they may pray for their lives.

1 Esdr 6:32
And he commanded that whosoever should transgress, yea, or make
light of any thing afore spoken or written, out of his own house
should a tree be taken, and he thereon be hanged, and all his
goods seized for the king.

1 Esdr 6:33
The Lord therefore, whose name is there called upon, utterly
destroy every king and nation, that stretcheth out his hand to
hinder or endamage that house of the Lord in Jerusalem.

1 Esdr 6:34
I Darius the king have ordained that according unto these things
it be done with diligence.

1 Esdr 7:1
Then Sisinnes the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, and Sathrabuzanes,
with their companions following the commandments of king Darius,

1 Esdr 7:2
Did very carefully oversee the holy works, assisting the ancients
of the Jews and governors of the temple.

1 Esdr 7:3
And so the holy works prospered, when Aggeus and Zacharias the
prophets prophesied.

1 Esdr 7:4
And they finished these things by the commandment of the Lord God of
Israel, and with the consent of Cyrus, Darius, and Artexerxes, kings
of Persia.

1 Esdr 7:5
And thus was the holy house finished in the three and twentieth day
of the month Adar, in the sixth year of Darius king of the Persians

1 Esdr 7:6
And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and
others that were of the captivity, that were added unto them,
did according to the things written in the book of Moses.

1 Esdr 7:7
And to the dedication of the temple of the Lord they offered
an hundred bullocks two hundred rams, four hundred lambs;

1 Esdr 7:8
And twelve goats for the sin of all Israel, according to the
number of the chief of the tribes of Israel.

1 Esdr 7:9
The priests also and the Levites stood arrayed in their vestments,
according to their kindreds, in the service of the Lord God of Israel,
according to the book of Moses: and the porters at every gate.

1 Esdr 7:10
And the children of Israel that were of the captivity held the
passover the fourteenth day of the first month, after that the
priests and the Levites were sanctified.

1 Esdr 7:11
They that were of the captivity were not all sanctified together:
but the Levites were all sanctified together.

1 Esdr 7:12
And so they offered the passover for all them of the captivity,
and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.

1 Esdr 7:13
And the children of Israel that came out of the captivity did eat,
even all they that had separated themselves from the abominations
of the people of the land, and sought the Lord.

1 Esdr 7:14
And they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days, making
merry before the Lord,

1 Esdr 7:15
For that he had turned the counsel of the king of Assyria toward
them, to strengthen their hands in the works of the Lord
God of Israel.

1 Esdr 8:1
And after these things, when Artexerxes the king of the Persians
reigned came Esdras the son of Saraias, the son of Ezerias, the
son of Helchiah, the son of Salum,

1 Esdr 8:2
The son of Sadduc, the son of Achitob, the son of Amarias, the son
of Ezias, the son of Meremoth, the son of Zaraias, the son of
Savias, the son of Boccas, the son of Abisum, the son of Phinees,
the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest.

1 Esdr 8:3
This Esdras went up from Babylon, as a scribe, being very ready
in the law of Moses, that was given by the God of Israel.

1 Esdr 8:4
And the king did him honour: for he found grace in his sight in
all his requests.

1 Esdr 8:5
There went up with him also certain of the children of Israel,
of the priest of the Levites, of the holy singers, porters, and
ministers of the temple, unto Jerusalem,

1 Esdr 8:6
In the seventh year of the reign of Artexerxes, in the fifth month,
this was the king's seventh year; for they went from Babylon in the
first day of the first month, and came to Jerusalem, according to
the prosperous journey which the Lord gave them.

1 Esdr 8:7
For Esdras had very great skill, so that he omitted nothing of
the law and commandments of the Lord, but taught all Israel the
ordinances and judgments.

1 Esdr 8:8
Now the copy of the commission, which was written from Artexerxes
the king, and came to Esdras the priest and reader of the law of
the Lord, is this that followeth;

1 Esdr 8:9
King Artexerxes unto Esdras the priest and reader of the law
of the Lord sendeth greeting:

1 Esdr 8:10
Having determined to deal graciously, I have given order, that
such of the nation of the Jews, and of the priests and Levites
being within our realm, as are willing and desirous should go
with thee unto Jerusalem.

1 Esdr 8:11
As many therefore as have a mind thereunto, let them depart with
thee, as it hath seemed good both to me and my seven friends the
counsellors;

1 Esdr 8:12
That they may look unto the affairs of Judea and Jerusalem, agreeably
to that which is in the law of the Lord;

1 Esdr 8:13
And carry the gifts unto the Lord of Israel to Jerusalem, which I
and my friends have vowed, and all the gold and silver that in the
country of Babylon can be found, to the Lord in Jerusalem,

1 Esdr 8:14
With that also which is given of the people for the temple of
the Lord their God at Jerusalem: and that silver and gold may be
collected for bullocks, rams, and lambs, and things thereunto
appertaining;

1 Esdr 8:15
To the end that they may offer sacrifices unto the Lord upon
the altar of the Lord their God, which is in Jerusalem.

1 Esdr 8:16
And whatsoever thou and thy brethren will do with the silver
and gold, that do, according to the will of thy God.

1 Esdr 8:17
And the holy vessels of the Lord, which are given thee for the use
of the temple of thy God, which is in Jerusalem, thou shalt set
before thy God in Jerusalem.

1 Esdr 8:18
And whatsoever thing else thou shalt remember for the use of the
temple of thy God, thou shalt give it out of the king's treasury.

1 Esdr 8:19
And I king Artexerxes have also commanded the keepers of the
treasures in Syria and Phenice, that whatsoever Esdras the priest
and the reader of the law of the most high God shall send for,
they should give it him with speed,

1 Esdr 8:20
To the sum of an hundred talents of silver, likewise also of
wheat even to an hundred cors, and an hundred pieces of wine,
and other things in abundance.

1 Esdr 8:21
Let all things be performed after the law of God diligently unto
the most high God, that wrath come not upon the kingdom of the king
and his sons.

1 Esdr 8:22
I command you also, that ye require no tax, nor any other imposition,
of any of the priests, or Levites, or holy singers, or porters, or
ministers of the temple, or of any that have doings in this temple,
and that no man have authority to impose any thing upon them.

1 Esdr 8:23
And thou, Esdras, according to the wisdom of God ordain judges and
justices, that they may judge in all Syria and Phenice all those
that know the law of thy God; and those that know it not thou shalt
teach.

1 Esdr 8:24
And whosoever shall transgress the law of thy God, and of the king,
shall be punished diligently, whether it be by death, or other
punishment, by penalty of money, or by imprisonment.

1 Esdr 8:25
Then said Esdras the scribe, Blessed be the only Lord God of my
fathers, who hath put these things into the heart of the king,
to glorify his house that is in Jerusalem:

1 Esdr 8:26
And hath honoured me in the sight of the king, and his counsellors,
and all his friends and nobles.

1 Esdr 8:27
Therefore was I encouraged by the help of the Lord my God, and
gathered together men of Israel to go up with me.

1 Esdr 8:28
And these are the chief according to their families and several
dignities, that went up with me from Babylon in the reign of
king Artexerxes:

1 Esdr 8:29
Of the sons of Phinees, Gerson: of the sons of Ithamar, Gamael:
of the sons of David, Lettus the son of Sechenias:

1 Esdr 8:30
Of the sons of Pharez, Zacharias; and with him were counted an
hundred and fifty men:

1 Esdr 8:31
Of the sons of Pahath Moab, Eliaonias, the son of Zaraias, and
with him two hundred men:

1 Esdr 8:32
Of the sons of Zathoe, Sechenias the son of Jezelus, and with
him three hundred men: of the sons of Adin, Obeth the son of
Jonathan, and with him two hundred and fifty men:

1 Esdr 8:33
Of the sons of Elam, Josias son of Gotholias, and with him seventy men:

1 Esdr 8:34
Of the sons of Saphatias, Zaraias son of Michael, and with him
threescore and ten men:

1 Esdr 8:35
Of the sons of Joab, Abadias son of Jezelus, and with him two hundred
and twelve men:

1 Esdr 8:36
Of the sons of Banid, Assalimoth son of Josaphias, and with him an
hundred and threescore men:

1 Esdr 8:37
Of the sons of Babi, Zacharias son of Bebai, and with him twenty and
eight men:

1 Esdr 8:38
Of the sons of Astath, Johannes son of Acatan, and with him an
hundred and ten men:

1 Esdr 8:39
Of the sons of Adonikam the last, and these are the names of
them, Eliphalet, Jewel, and Samaias, and with them seventy men:

1 Esdr 8:40
Of the sons of Bago, Uthi the son of Istalcurus, and with him
seventy men.

1 Esdr 8:41
And these I gathered together to the river called Theras, where
we pitched our tents three days: and then I surveyed them.

1 Esdr 8:42
But when I had found there none of the priests and Levites,

1 Esdr 8:43
Then sent I unto Eleazar, and Iduel, and Masman,

1 Esdr 8:44
And Alnathan, and Mamaias, and Joribas, and Nathan, Eunatan,
Zacharias, and Mosollamon, principal men and learned.

1 Esdr 8:45
And I bade them that they should go unto Saddeus the captain,
who was in the place of the treasury:

1 Esdr 8:46
And commanded them that they should speak unto Daddeus, and
to his brethren, and to the treasurers in that place, to send us
such men as might execute the priests' office in the house of
the Lord.

1 Esdr 8:47
And by the mighty hand of our Lord they brought unto us skilful
men of the sons of Moli the son of Levi, the son of Israel,
Asebebia, and his sons, and his brethren, who were eighteen.

1 Esdr 8:48
And Asebia, and Annus, and Osaias his brother, of the sons of
Channuneus, and their sons, were twenty men.

1 Esdr 8:49
And of the servants of the temple whom David had ordained, and
the principal men for the service of the Levites to wit, the
servants of the temple two hundred and twenty, the catalogue of
whose names were shewed.

1 Esdr 8:50
And there I vowed a fast unto the young men before our Lord,
to desire of him a prosperous journey both for us and them that
were with us, for our children, and for the cattle:

1 Esdr 8:51
For I was ashamed to ask the king footmen, and horsemen, and
conduct for safeguard against our adversaries.

1 Esdr 8:52
For we had said unto the king, that the power of the Lord our
God should be with them that seek him, to support them in all
ways.

1 Esdr 8:53
And again we besought our Lord as touching these things, and
found him favourable unto us.

1 Esdr 8:54
Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Esebrias, and
Assanias, and ten men of their brethren with them:

1 Esdr 8:55
And I weighed them the gold, and the silver, and the holy vessels
of the house of our Lord, which the king, and his council, and the
princes, and all Israel, had given.

1 Esdr 8:56
And when I had weighed it, I delivered unto them six hundred and
fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels of an hundred talents,
and an hundred talents of gold,

1 Esdr 8:57
And twenty golden vessels, and twelve vessels of brass, even
of fine brass, glittering like gold.

1 Esdr 8:58
And I said unto them, Both ye are holy unto the Lord, and the
vessels are holy, and the gold and the silver is a vow unto the
Lord, the Lord of our fathers.

1 Esdr 8:59
Watch ye, and keep them till ye deliver them to the chief of the
priests and Levites, and to the principal men of the families
of Israel, in Jerusalem, into the chambers of the house of our God.

1 Esdr 8:60
So the priests and the Levites, who had received the silver
and the gold and the vessels, brought them unto Jerusalem, into
the temple of the Lord.

1 Esdr 8:61
And from the river Theras we departed the twelfth day of the
