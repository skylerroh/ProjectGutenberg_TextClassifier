squeezed by some means or other. Off we set, but no woman of any rank
would accompany me, for they said I had the courage of an Amazon to
attempt to make my way through the mob that was howling in the streets.

It certainly was somewhat terrible when we came out into the street
thronged with people carrying lanterns and torches, and tried to make
our way step by step. We had not gone far before a big man, a butcher
I should think, held up a torch to the window, and seeing my son's long
fair hair, shouted, 'The King! the King! Here is the Queen carrying the
King and the Duke of Anjou!'

The whole mob seemed to surge round us, shrieking, screaming, and
yelling; some trying to turn the horses, others insisting that we should
alight. No one heard my assurances that we were no such personages, that
this was Mademoiselle's carriage, and that the Queen was gone long ago;
and, what was more fortunate, their ears did not catch young Mericour's
denunciations of them as vile canaille. A market woman mounted on the
step, and perceiving the mattress, screeched out, 'The Cardinal--they
are carrying off the Cardinal rolled up in a mattress!'

Their fury was redoubled. I began to unite it to show them there was
nothing, but we had drawn the knots too tight, and Gaspard's little
sword would not of course cut, nay, the gleam of it only added to the
general fury. I really think if the Cardinal had been there they would
have torn him to pieces. They were trying to drag open the doors,
and would have done so much sooner but for the crowds who were pushed
against them and kept them shut. At last there seemed to be some one
among them with a more authoritative tone. The pressure on the door
lessened, and it was to my dismay torn open; but at that moment my son
called out, 'M. Darpent! Oh, M. Darpent, come to my mother!' Immediately
M. Clement Darpent, unarmed and in his usual dress, with only a little
came in his hand, made his way forward. Before I saw him I heard his
welcome voice calling, 'Madame de Bellaise here! I am coming, M. le
Marquis! The Queen! Betise! I tell you it is a lady of my acquaintance.'

'The Cardinal! She is carrying off the Italian rolled up in a mattress!
Down with the fox!' came another terrible outcry; but by this time M.
Darpent had been hustled up to the door, and put himself between us
and the throng. He could hear me now when I told him it was merely
Mademoiselle's bedding which we were carrying out to her. He shouted out
this intelligence, and it made a lull; but one horrid fellow in a fur
cap sneered, 'We know better than that, Monsieur! Away with traitors!
And those who would smuggle them away!'

'Oh! show it to them!' I cried; and then I saw a face that I had known
in the hospital, and called him by name. 'Jean Marie, my good friend,
have you your knife to cut these cords and show there is nothing
inside?'

The man's honest face lighted up. 'Hein! The good tall lady who brought
me bouillons! I warrant there is no harm in her, brothers! She's a good
Frondeuse, and has nothing to do with foreign traitors.'

He ranged himself beside Clement Darpent, offering a big knife,
wherewith in a moment the bands were cut and the mattress help up to
view, with a few clothes inside.

I made my two defenders understand that they were Mademoiselle's
garments, and when this was repeated there was a general shout: 'Vive la
bonne dame! Vive Mademoiselle! Vive Monsieur! Vive la Fronde!'

Jean Marie, who had worked in a furniture shop, would have rolled up the
bed in a trice much better than before, but M. Darpent observed that
as we were not yet out of Paris is might bring us into trouble, and,
inconvenient as it was, he advised us to keep it open till we were
beyond the gates. He asked permission to accompany me to prevent
any further annoyance, and Jean Marie, to the extreme disgust of the
servants, mounted the box, to serve as an additional guard.

No one could be kinder than M. Darpent. He was very sad about this
flight of the Court. He said he feared it was the beginning of a civil
war, and that he had thought better of the blood royal and noblesse of
France than to suppose they would assist a Spanish woman and an Italian
priest to trample down and starve their fellow-countrymen in the name of
a minor king. He expected that there would be a siege, for he was sure
that the temper of the people was averse to yielding, and the bourgeois
put their trust in the archers.

I asked if he thought there would be any danger, thinking that I would
either join my mother and sister or endeavour to fetch them away; but he
assured me that they would be safe. Was not the Queen of England left,
as I assured him, and the Duchess of Longueville? M. le Prince
would allow no harm to touch the place where lived the sister he so
passionately loved. I might be secure that the Hotel de Nid de Merle
was perfectly safe, and he would himself watch to see that they were
not annoyed or terrified. He gave me the means of writing a billet to my
mother from his little Advocate's portfolio, and he promised himself to
convey it to her and assure her of our safety, a message which I thought
would make him welcome even to her. He was most kind in every way, and
when we came near the gate bethought him that the two little boys looked
pale and hungry, as well they might. He stopped the carriage near a
baker's shop, which was already open, and going in himself, returned
with not only bread, but a jug and cup of milk. I think we never enjoyed
anything so much; and in the meantime the excellent Jean Marie rolled up
our mattress so close that, as Gaspard said, it could hardly have been
supposed to contain in puppy dog.

They saw us safely through the barriers. M. Darpent gave his word for
us, and out we went into the country while scarcely the dawn was yet
seen. At a turn in the road we saw only the morning star hanging like
a great lamp in the east, and I showed it to the little boys, and
told them of the three kings led by the Star to the Cradle. I heard
afterwards that the little Chevalier thought we saw the real Star in the
East sent to guide us to St. Germain, forgetting that it was the wrong
direction; but he had been very little taught, and this was the first
he had ever heard of the Gospel, which was familiar to my boy. They both
fell asleep presently on the cushions, and I think I did so likewise,
for I was surprised to find myself at St. Germain in broad daylight.
Everybody was gone to mass for the festival, and we crept in after them.

Mademoiselle was delighted to see me, and always believed we had made
our passage so safely in consequence of the respect paid to her and her
carriage. It was a strange day; no one did anything but run about and
hear or tell news of how the people in Paris were taking the departure
of the Court, and wonder when the troops would come up to begin the
siege, or, what was more pressing, what was to be done for food and for
bedding? We ate as we could. Eggs and fowls were brought in from the
farms, but plates and dishes, knives and forks, were very scarce. Some
of us were happy when we could roast an egg in the embers for ourselves,
and then eat it when it was hard enough, and I thought how useful Annora
would have been, who had done all sorts of household work during the
troubles at home. But we were very merry over these devices.

The night was a greater difficulty. Most of the windows had no frames
nor glass in them, and hardly any one had a bed. Mademoiselle slept in a
long gallery, splendidly painted and gilt, but with the wind blowing
at every crevice through the shutters, no curtains; only a few marble
tables against the wall by way of furniture, and the mattress spread
upon the floor for her and her youngest sister, who would not sleep
unless she sang, and who woke continually.

I rolled up my two little boys in my great fur cloak, which I had
happily brought with me, for no one seemed disposed to take any charge
of poor little Mericour, and Nicolas fetches me the cushions from the
carriage, so that they were tolerably comfortable.

As to us ladies and gentlemen, we rejoiced that at least faggots could
be had. We made up a great fire, and sat round it, some playing at
cards, other playing at games, telling stories, or reciting poetry,
interspersed with the sillier pastime of love-making. Every one nodded
off to sleep, but soon to wake again,--and, oh, how still we were, and
how our bones ached after two such nights!

And the saddest and most provoking thing, at least to many of us, was
the high spirits of the Queen-Regent.

To be sure, she had not been without a bed in an unglazed room all
night, and had a few maids and a charge of clothes, but she had probably
never been so much out of reach of state in her life, and she evidently
found it most amusing. She did not seem to have an idea that it was a
fearful thing to begin a civil war, but thought the astonishment and
disappointment of the Parisians an excellent joke. Grave and stately as
she was by nature, she seemed quite transformed, and laughed like a girl
when no gold spoon could be found for her chocolate and she had to use
a silver one. Yes, and she laughed still more at the ill-arranged limp
curls and tumbled lace of us poor creatures who had sat up all night,
and tried to dress one another, with one pocket-comb amongst us all!

All that day and all the text, however, parts of different people's
equipages kept coming from Paris. Mademoiselle's were escorted by M.
de Fiesque, who had been so civilly treated that Mademoiselle gave
passports for the Queen's wagons to come through Paris; and it was
considered to be a great joke that one of the bourgeois, examining
a large box of new Spanish gloves, was reported to have been quite
overcome by the perfume, and to have sneezed violently when he came to
examine them.

We were in a strange state up there on the heights of St. Germain. Some
of the Court had no hangings for their great draughty rooms, others had
no clothes, and those who had clothes had no bedding. Very few of us had
any money to supply our wants, and those who had soon lent it all to
the more distressed. The Queen herself was obliged to borrow from the
Princess Dowager, even to provide food, and the keeping up of separate
tables was impossible. We all dined together, King and Queen, Monsieur,
Madame, and all, and the first day there was nothing but a great pot au
feu and the bouilli out of it; for the cooks had not arrived. Even the
spoons and knives were so few that we had to wash them and use them in
turn. However, it was all gaiety on those first days, the Queen was so
merry that it was every one's cue to be the same; and as to the King
and the Duke of Anjou, they were full of mischief; it was nothing but
holiday to them to have no Court receptions.

At eight o'clock in the evening there came a deputation from Paris. They
were kept waiting outside in the snow while the Queen considered whether
to receive them; and she could hardly be persuaded to allow them to
sleep under shelter at St. Germain, though on the road at that time of
night they were in danger from brigands, traveling soldiers, and I know
not what!

They were at last admitted to the ranger's lodgings, and had an
interview with the Chancellor, who was harsh and peremptory, perhaps
feeling himself avenged for his troubles and fright on the day of the
barricades.

When I heard that the President Darpent was among the deputation I sent
Nicolas to find out whether his son were there; and by and by I received
a little billet, which excited much more attention than I wished. Some
told me I was a Frondeuse, and M. le Baron de Lamont pretended to be
consumed with jealousy. I had to explain publicly that it was only from
my sister, and then they pretended not to believe me. It was in English,
a tongue of which nobody knew a single word, except that scandal
declared that the Duke of Buckingham had taught the Queen to say 'Ee
lofe ou;' but it said only: 'We are quite well, and not alarmed, since
we know you are safe. We had heard such strange rumors that my mother
welcomed our friend as an angel of consolation.'

I translated this to all whom it concerned; but M. de Lamont annoyed me
much with his curiosity and incredulity. However, when I found that the
unfortunate deputies were permitted to spend the night in the guard-room
I sent Nicolas to see whether he could be of any use to the Darpents.
Truly it was a night when, as the English say, one would not turn out
one's enemy's dog, and the road to Paris was far from safe; but the
ranger's house was a wretched place for elderly men more used to comfort
than even the noblesse, whose castles are often bare enough, and who are
crowded and ill accommodated when in waiting at the palaces.

At that moment a bed was to ourselves a delightful luxury, which M. de
Fiesque and I were to share, so Nicolas could not do much for poor old
Darpent, whom he found wet through from having waited so long in the
snow, melting as it fell; but he did lend him his own dry cloak, and got
some hot drink for him. Clemet professed himself eternally grateful for
this poor attention when in the morning I sent my son with another note
in return to be sent to my mother and sister; and he promised to watch
over them as his own life.

This was the last communication I had with my family for two months. The
Queen had declared that her absence would be only 'a little expedition
of a week;' but week after week passed on, and there we still were on
the hill. The troops could not entirely surround Paris, but no such
thing. I think we were, on the whole, more hungry than those whom we
blockaded.

As each set of officials finished their time of waiting they retired,
and nobody came to replace them, so our party became smaller from day
to day, which was the less to be regretted as our Lent was Lent indeed.
Nobody had any money, and provisions ran very short; everybody grumbled
but the Queen and Cardinal, and Mademoiselle, who enjoyed the situation
and laughed at everybody.

In the intervals of grumbling every one was making love. M. de Juvizy
actually was presumptuous enough to make love to the Queen, or to boast
that he did. Mademoiselle, I am sorry to say, was in love, or, more
truly, in ambition with the Prince of Conde; M. de S. Maigrin was said
to be in love with the Princess, M. de Chatillon with Mademoiselle de
Guerchy, and so on.

Even I, who had always declared that it was a woman's own fault if
she had a lover, did not escape. I had not my mother to shield me, and
nobody had anything to do, so it was the universal fashion; and M.
de Lamont thought proper to pursue me. I knew he was dissipated and
good-for-nothing, and I showed the coldest indifference; but that only
gave him the opportunity of talking of my cruelty, and he even persuaded
Mademoiselle to assure me that he was in earnest.

'No doubt,' said I, 'he would like to meddle with the administration of
Nid de Merle. I have no doubt he is in earnest about that!'

But there was no escape, as we lived, from being beset. We had all to
attend the Queen to the Litanies at the chapel. She used to remain in
her little orator praying long after they were finished, Mademoiselle
with her, and, by her own account, generally asleep. I am ashamed to say
how much chatter, and how many petits soins, went on among those waiting
outside. I used to kneel, as I heard people say, like a grim statue over
my chair, with my rosary hanging from my hands, for if I did but hear a
rustle and turn my head, there stood M. de Lamont with a bonbonniere,
or an offer to shield me from the draught, and I could hear a tittering
behind me.

Yet there was enough to make us grave. In a fight with the Frondeurs
for Charenton, M. de Chatillon, one of the handsomest and gayest of our
cavaliers, was killed. He was the grandson of the Admiral de Coligny,
and was said to have been converted to the Church by the miracle of the
ducks returning regularly to the pond where the saint had bound them
to come. I think he must have made up his mind beforehand. But it was a
great shock to have that fine young man thus cut down the day after he
had been laughing and dancing in our gallery. Yet all people seemed to
think of, when everybody went to condole with his young widow in her
bed, was that she had set herself off to the best advantage to captivate
M. de Nemours!

And then came the great thunderbolt--the tidings of the death of the
King of England! I knew it would almost kill Eustace; I thought of my
poor godmother, Queen Henrietta, and there I was among people who did
not really care in the least! It was to them merely a great piece of
news, that enabled them to say, 'Yield an inch to the Parliament and see
what it will come to.'

That kind, dignified, melancholy countenance as I last saw it was
constantly before me. The babble of the people around seemed to
me detestable. I answered at haphazard, and begged permission of
Mademoiselle to keep my room for a day, as I thought I should be
distracted if I could not get out of reach of M. de Lamont.

She gave permission, but she said it was an affectation of mine, for how
could I care for a somber old prince whom I had not seen for ten years?




CHAPTER XIX. -- INSIDE PARIS

Annora's narrative.



My sister has asked me to fill up the account of the days of the Fronde
with what I saw within the city. She must permit me to do so in English,
for I have taken care to forget my French; and if I write perilous stuff
for French folk to read she need not translate it.

I will begin with that Twelfth-day morning when we were wakened by more
noise and racket than even Paris could generally produce. There had been
a little tumult about once a week for the last six months, so we could
endure a great deal, but this was plainly a much larger one. Some of the
servants who went out brought word that the Queen had carried off the
King in order to be revenged on Paris, and that the people, in a rage,
were breaking the carriages of her suite to pieces, plundering the
wagons, and beating, if not killing, every one in them. We were of
course mightily troubled for my sister, and being only two women we
could not go out in quest of her, while each rumour we heard was more
terrible than the last. Some even said that the Louvre had been asked
and plundered; but old Sir Andrew Macniven, who had made his way through
the mob like a brave old Scottish knight, brought us word that he could
assure us that our own Queen was safe in her own apartments, and that
there had been no attack on the palace.

Still he had himself seen carriages plundered and broken to pieces by
the mob, and the gates were closely guarded. Seeing our distress, he was
about to go with Abbe to the Louvre, to learn whether my sister and
her son were there, when one of the servants came up to tell us that M.
Clement Darpent requested to see my mother, having brought us tidings of
Madame la Vicomtesse.

My poor mother never could endure the name of M. Darpent, because she
did not like my brother's friendship with any one not noble, but she was
as glad to see him then as if he had been a Montmorency or a Coucy.

I always like his manners, for they were even then more English than
French. Though going through all due form, he always seemed to respect
himself too much to let any one be supercilious with him; and however
she might begin at a vast distance, she always ended by talking to
him just as if he were, as she called it, our equal. As if he were
not infinitely the superior of the hundreds of trumpery little apes of
nobles who strutted about the galleries of the Louvre, with nothing to
do but mayhap to carry the Queen's fan, or curl her poodle's tail!

I see I have been writing just as I felt in those fervent days of my
youth, when the quick blood would throb at my heart and burn in my cheek
at any slight to the real manhood and worth I saw in him, and preference
for the poor cringing courtiers I despised. The thought of those old
days has brought me back to the story as all then seemed to me--the
high-spirited, hot-tempered maiden, who had missed all her small chances
of even being mild and meek in the troubles at home, and to whom Paris
was a grievous place of banishment, only tolerable by the aid of my dear
brother and my poor Meg, when she was not too French and too Popish for
me. But that was not her fault, poor thing.

My mother, however, was grateful enough to Clement Darpent for the
nonce, when he told how he had seen Meg safe beyond the gates. Moreover,
he assured us that so far from 8000 horse being ready to storm the city
(I should like to have seen them! Who ever took a fortress with a charge
of horse?) barely 200 had escorted their Majesties. The Coadjutor had
shown M. Blancmesnil a note from the Queen telling him so, and summoning
him to St. Germain.

It was likely, M. Darpent said, that the city would be besieged, but he
did not foresee any peril for us, and he promised to watch over us,
as he would over his own mother, and that he would give us continual
intelligence so that we might provide for our safety. It was amusing
to see how eagerly my mother accepted this offer, though she had almost
forbidden him the house when my brother left us.

I am sure my mother was as uneasy as any of us when he did not appear on
the morning after he had gone with his father on the deputation to St.
Germain. However, he did come later on in the afternoon, bringing a note
from Meg. He had not seen her, only Nicolas and little Gaspard, and
he, like all the rest, was greatly incensed at the manner in which the
magistrates had been treated. His father had, he said, caught a violent
cold, and had been forced to go to bed at once. In fact it really was
the poor old man's death-stroke, and he never quitted his chamber,
hardly even his bed.

The Parliament, in a rage, put forth a decree, declaring the Cardinal an
enemy to the State, and ordering him to leave the Court and kingdom
on that very day, calling on all loyal subjects to fall on him, and
forbidding any one to give him shelter.

We heard loud acclamations, which made us think something unusual was
going on, and it was the publication of this precious edict. I wondered
who they thought was going to attend to it when M. Darpent brought in a
copy. And my mother began to cry and talk about Lord Strafford. I had
to think of Eustace and bite my tongue to keep my patience at our noble
'thorough' Wentworth being likened to that base cringing Italian.

Clement Darpent said, however, that every one had passed it by
acclamation, except Bernai, who was a mere cook, and gave fine dinners
to such a set of low, loose creatures that he was called 'le cabaretier
de la cour.' Moreover, they proceeded to give orders for levying 4000
horse and 10,000 foot. This really did mean civil war.

'I knew it,' said my mother, 'it is the next step after denouncing the
King's minister. We shall see you next armed cap-a-pie, like our young
advocates at home, all for the King's behalf, according to them.'

Of course she was thinking of Harry Merrycourt, but she was surprised by
the answer.

'No, Madam, nothing shall induce me to bear arms against the King. So
much have I learned from the two living persons who I esteem the most.'

'And they are?' asked my lady.

'My mother and monsieur votre fils,' he replied.

And I could not help crying out--

'Oh, sir, you are right. I know that Harry Merrycourt feels NOW that
nothing can justify rebellion, and that he little knew whither he should
be led.'

'And yet,' said he, clasping his hands together with intensity of
fervour, 'when all is rotten to the core, venal, unjust, tyrannical, how
endure without an endeavour at a remedy? Yet it may be that an imposing
attitude will prevail! Self-defence without a blow.'

It seemed as if such war as they were likely to wage could do no
one much damage, for they actually chose as their generalissimo that
ridiculous little sickly being, the Prince de Conty, who had quarrelled
with the Court about a cardinal's hat, and had run away from his
mother's apron string at St. Germain to his sister's at Paris.

On recalling it, all was a mere farce together, and the people were
always stringing together lampoons in rhyme, and singing them in the
streets. One still rings in my head, about a dissolute impoverished
Marquis d'Elbeuf, one of the house of Lorraine, whom the prospect of pay
induced to offer his services to the Parliament.


                   'Le pauvre Monseigneur d'Elbeuf,
