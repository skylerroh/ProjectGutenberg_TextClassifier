SAINT GEORGE FOR ENGLAND

By G. A. Henty




PREFACE.


MY DEAR LADS,

You may be told perhaps that there is no good to be obtained from tales
of fighting and bloodshed,--that there is no moral to be drawn from such
histories. Believe it not. War has its lessons as well as Peace. You
will learn from tales like this that determination and enthusiasm
can accomplish marvels, that true courage is generally accompanied by
magnanimity and gentleness, and that if not in itself the very highest
of virtues, it is the parent of almost all the others, since but few
of them can be practised without it. The courage of our forefathers has
created the greatest empire in the world around a small and in itself
insignificant island; if this empire is ever lost, it will be by the
cowardice of their descendants.

At no period of her history did England stand so high in the eyes
of Europe as in the time whose events are recorded in this volume. A
chivalrous king and an even more chivalrous prince had infected the
whole people with their martial spirit, and the result was that their
armies were for a time invincible, and the most astonishing successes
were gained against numbers which would appear overwhelming. The
victories of Cressy and Poitiers may be to some extent accounted for by
superior generalship and discipline on the part of the conquerors; but
this will not account for the great naval victory over the Spanish fleet
off the coast of Sussex, a victory even more surprising and won against
greater odds than was that gained in the same waters centuries later
over the Spanish Armada. The historical facts of the story are all
drawn from Froissart and other contemporary historians, as collated
and compared by Mr. James in his carefully written history. They may
therefore be relied upon as accurate in every important particular.

Yours sincerely,

G. A. HENTY.




CHAPTER I: A WAYFARER


It was a bitterly cold night in the month of November, 1330. The rain
was pouring heavily, when a woman, with child in her arms, entered the
little village of Southwark. She had evidently come from a distance, for
her dress was travel-stained and muddy. She tottered rather than walked,
and when, upon her arrival at the gateway on the southern side of London
Bridge, she found that the hour was past and the gates closed for the
night, she leant against the wall with a faint groan of exhaustion and
disappointment.

After remaining, as if in doubt, for some time, she feebly made her way
into the village. Here were many houses of entertainment, for travelers
like herself often arrived too late to enter the gates, and had to abide
outside for the night. Moreover, house rent was dear within the walls of
the crowded city, and many, whose business brought them to town, found
it cheaper to take up their abode in the quiet hostels of Southwark
rather than to stay in the more expensive inns within the walls. The
lights came out brightly from many of the casements, with sounds of
boisterous songs and laughter. The woman passed these without a pause.
Presently she stopped before a cottage, from which a feeble light alone
showed that it was tenanted.

She knocked at the door. It was opened by a pleasant-faced man of some
thirty years old.

"What is it?" he asked.

"I am a wayfarer," the woman answered feebly. "Canst take me and my
child in for the night?"

"You have made a mistake," the man said; "this is no inn. Further up the
road there are plenty of places where you can find such accommodation as
you lack."

"I have passed them," the woman said, "but all seemed full of
roisterers. I am wet and weary, and my strength is nigh spent. I can pay
thee, good fellow, and I pray you as a Christian to let me come in and
sleep before your fire for the night. When the gates are open in
the morning I will go; for I have a friend within the city who will,
methinks, receive me."

The tone of voice, and the addressing of himself as good fellow, at once
convinced the man that the woman before him was no common wayfarer.

"Come in," he said; "Geoffrey Ward is not a man to shut his doors in
a woman's face on a night like this, nor does he need payment for such
small hospitality. Come hither, Madge!" he shouted; and at his voice a
woman came down from the upper chamber. "Sister," he said; "this is a
wayfarer who needs shelter for the night; she is wet and weary. Do you
take her up to your room and lend her some dry clothing; then make her
a cup of warm posset, which she needs sorely. I will fetch an armful
of fresh rushes from the shed and strew them here: I will sleep in the
smithy. Quick, girl," he said sharply; "she is fainting with cold and
fatigue." And as he spoke he caught the woman as she was about to fall,
and laid her gently on the ground. "She is of better station than she
seems," he said to his sister; "like enough some poor lady whose husband
has taken part in the troubles; but that is no business of ours. Quick,
Madge, and get these wet things off her; she is soaked to the skin. I
will go round to the Green Dragon and will fetch a cup of warm cordial,
which I warrant me will put fresh life into her."

So saying, he took down his flat cap from its peg on the wall and went
out, while his sister at once proceeded to remove the drenched
garments and to rub the cold hands of the guest until she recovered
consciousness. When Geoffrey Ward returned, the woman was sitting in a
settle by the fireside, dressed in a warm woolen garment belonging to
his sister.

Madge had thrown fresh wood on the fire, which was blazing brightly now.
The woman drank the steaming beverage which her host brought with him.
The colour came faintly again into her cheeks.

"I thank you, indeed," she said, "for your kindness. Had you not taken
me in I think I would have died at your door, for indeed I could go no
further; and though I hold not to life, yet would I fain live until I
have delivered my boy into the hands of those who will be kind to him,
and this will, I trust, be tomorrow."

"Say nought about it," Geoffrey answered; "Madge and I are right glad
to have been of service to you. It would be a poor world indeed if one
could not give a corner of one's fireside to a fellow-creature on such
a night as this, especially when that fellow creature is a woman with
a child. Poor little chap! He looks right well and sturdy, and seems to
have taken no ill from his journey."

"Truly, he is well and sturdy," the mother said, looking at him proudly;
"indeed I have been almost wishing today that he were lighter by a few
pounds, for in truth I am not used to carry him far, and his weight has
sorely tried me. His name is Walter, and I trust," she added, looking at
the powerful figure of her host, "that he will grow up as straight and
as stalwart as yourself." The child, who was about three years old,
was indeed an exceedingly fine little fellow, as he sat, in one scanty
garment, in his mother's lap, gazing with round eyes at the blazing
fire; and the smith thought how pretty a picture the child and mother
made. She was a fair, gentle-looking girl some two-and-twenty years old,
and it was easy enough to see now from her delicate features and soft
shapely hands that she had never been accustomed to toil.

"And now," the smith said, "I will e'en say good night. The hour is
late, and I shall be having the watch coming along to know why I keep a
fire so long after the curfew. Should you be a stranger in the city,
I will gladly act as your guide in the morning to the friends whom
you seek, that is, should they be known to me; but if not, we shall
doubtless find them without difficulty."

So saying, the smith retired to his bed of rushes in the smithy, and
soon afterwards the tired visitor, with her baby, lay down on the rushes
in front of the fire, for in those days none of the working or artisan
class used beds, which were not indeed, for centuries afterwards, in
usage by the common people.

In the morning Geoffrey Ward found that his guest desired to find one
Giles Fletcher, a maker of bows.

"I know him well," the smith said. "There are many who do a larger
business, and hold their heads higher; but Giles Fletcher is well
esteemed as a good workman, whose wares can be depended upon. It is
often said of him that did he take less pains he would thrive more; but
he handles each bow that he makes as if he loved it, and finishes and
polishes each with his own hand. Therefore he doeth not so much trade as
those who are less particular with their wares, for he hath to charge
a high price to be able to live. But none who have ever bought his bows
have regretted the silver which they cost. Many and many a gross of
arrowheads have I sold him, and he is well-nigh as particular in
their make as he is over the spring and temper of his own bows. Many a
friendly wrangle have I had with him over their weight and finish, and
it is not many who find fault with my handiwork, though I say it myself;
and now, madam, I am at your service."

During the night the wayfarer's clothes had been dried. The cloak was of
rough quality, such as might have been used by a peasant woman; but the
rest, though of sombre colour, were of good material and fashion. Seeing
that her kind entertainers would be hurt by the offer of money, the lady
contented herself with thanking Madge warmly, and saying that she hoped
to come across the bridge one day with Dame Fletcher; then, under the
guidance of Geoffrey, who insisted on carrying the boy, she set out from
the smith's cottage. They passed under the outer gate and across the
bridge, which later on was covered with a double line of houses and
shops, but was now a narrow structure. Over the gateway across the
river, upon pikes, were a number of heads and human limbs. The lady
shuddered as she looked up.

"It is an ugly sight," the smith said, "and I can see no warrant for
such exposure of the dead. There are the heads of Wallace, of three of
Robert Bruce's brothers, and of many other valiant Scotsmen who fought
against the king's grandfather some twenty years back. But after all
they fought for their country, just as Harold and our ancestors against
the Normans under William, and I think it a foul shame that men who have
done no other harm should be beheaded, still less that their heads and
limbs should be stuck up there gibbering at all passers-by. There are
over a score of them, and every fresh trouble adds to their number; but
pardon me," he said suddenly as a sob from the figure by his side called
his attention from the heads on the top of the gateway, "I am rough and
heedless in speech, as my sister Madge does often tell me, and it may
well be that I have said something which wounded you."

"You meant no ill," the lady replied; "it was my own thoughts and
troubles which drew tears from me; say not more about it, I pray you."

They passed under the gateway, with its ghastly burden, and were soon in
the crowded streets of London. High overhead the houses extended, each
story advancing beyond that below it until the occupiers of the attics
could well-nigh shake hands across. They soon left the more crowded
streets, and turning to the right, after ten minutes walking, the smith
stopped in front of a bowyer shop near Aldgate.

"This is the shop," he said, "and there is Giles Fletcher himself trying
the spring and pull of one of his bows. Here I will leave you, and will
one of these days return to inquire if your health has taken ought of
harm by the rough buffeting of the storm of yester-even."

So saying he handed the child to its mother, and with a wave of the hand
took his leave, not waiting to listen to the renewed thanks which his
late guest endeavoured to give him.

The shop was open in front, a projecting penthouse sheltered it from the
weather; two or three bows lay upon a wide shelf in front, and several
large sheaves of arrows tied together stood by the wall. A powerful man
of some forty years old was standing in the middle of the shop with a
bent bow in his arm, taking aim at a spot in the wall. Through an open
door three men could be seen in an inner workshop cutting and shaping
the wood for bows. The bowyer looked round as his visitor entered the
shop, and then, with a sudden exclamation, lowered the bow.

"Hush, Giles!" the lady exclaimed; "it is I, but name no names; it were
best that none knew me here."

The craftsman closed the door of communication into the inner room.
"My Lady Alice," he exclaimed in a low tone, "you here, and in such a
guise?"

"Surely it is I," the lady sighed, "although sometimes I am well-nigh
inclined to ask myself whether it be truly I or not, or whether this be
not all a dreadful dream."

"I had heard but vaguely of your troubles," Giles Fletcher said, "but
hoped that the rumours were false. Ever since the Duke of Kent was
executed the air has been full of rumours. Then came news of the killing
of Mortimer and of the imprisonment of the king's mother, and it was
said that many who were thought to be of her party had been attacked and
slain, and I heard--" and there he stopped.

"You heard rightly, good Giles, it is all true. A week after the slaying
of Mortimer a band of knights and men-at-arms arrived at our castle and
demanded admittance in the king's name. Sir Roland refused, for he had
news that many were taking up arms, but it was useless. The castle was
attacked, and after three days' fighting, was taken. Roland was killed,
and I was cast out with my child. Afterwards they repented that they
had let me go, and searched far and wide for me; but I was hidden in the
cottage of a woodcutter. They were too busy in hunting down others whom
they proclaimed to be enemies of the king, as they had wrongfully said
of Roland, who had but done his duty faithfully to Queen Isabella, and
was assuredly no enemy of her son, although he might well be opposed to
the weak and indolent king, his father. However, when the search relaxed
I borrowed the cloak of the good man's wife and set out for London,
whither I have traveled on foot, believing that you and Bertha would
take me in and shelter me in my great need."

"Aye, that will we willingly," Giles said. "Was not Bertha your nurse?
and to whom should you come if not to her? But will it please you to
mount the stairs, for Bertha will not forgive me if I keep you talking
down here. What a joy it will be to her to see you again!"

So saying, Giles led the way to the apartment above. There was a scream
of surprise and joy from his wife, and then Giles quietly withdrew
downstairs again, leaving the women to cry in each other's arms.

A few days later Geoffrey Ward entered the shop of Giles Fletcher.

"I have brought you twenty score of arrowheads, Master Giles," he said.
"They have been longer in hand than is usual with me, but I have been
pressed. And how goes it with the lady whom I brought to your door last
week?"

"But sadly, Master Ward, very sadly, as I told you when I came across to
thank you again in her name and my own for your kindness to her. She
was but in poor plight after her journey; poor thing, she was little
accustomed to such wet and hardship, and doubtless they took all
the more effect because she was low in spirit and weakened with much
grieving. That night she was taken with a sort of fever, hot and cold
by turns, and at times off her head. Since then she has lain in a high
fever and does not know even my wife; her thoughts ever go back to the
storming of the castle, and she cries aloud and begs them to spare her
lord's life. It is pitiful to hear her. The leech gives but small hope
for her life, and in troth, Master Ward, methinks that God would deal
most gently with her were He to take her. Her heart is already in her
husband's grave, for she was ever of a most loving and faithful nature.
Here there would be little comfort for her--she would fret that her boy
would never inherit the lands of his father; and although she knows
well enough that she would be always welcome here, and that Bertha would
serve her as gladly and faithfully as ever she did when she was her
nurse, yet she could not but greatly feel the change. She was tenderly
brought up, being, as I told you last week, the only daughter of
