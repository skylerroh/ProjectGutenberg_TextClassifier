
"But I am sure Dino does not sleep here," said Cornelli, surprised.

"No, this is the kitchen; there are no beds here," Mux asserted. "But
I shall show you first why Agnes cried one whole hour to-day, or perhaps
it was two." And Mux led his new friend to a whole pile of apple peels
which lay in a bucket. "Isn't Agnes stupid to cry when we get good
apple tarts afterwards."

"But why did she cry?" asked Cornelli, full of sympathy. She knew
exactly what it was like when one simply had to cry.

"We don't know," retorted Mux.

"But why does the maid not peel the apples?" asked Cornelli again.

"There is no maid, except block-headed Trina," Mux informed her.

"Who is block-headed Trina?" Cornelli wanted to know.

"She has to help; she is small and fat," Mux described her. "Mama has
to show her how to cook, and she has to fetch what we need and always
brings the wrong thing. So Dino says: 'We really must send block-headed
Trina away.' And then Mama says: 'Trina has to live, too.' And then
she is not sent away after all."

Cornelli had great sympathy for Agnes, who apparently had a secret
trouble like her own; she did not have to be afraid of her, as she was
of the proud sister who had received her.

"I am sure, Mux, that your other sister never cries. Are you not afraid
of her?" asked Cornelli.

"Not the least little bit," replied the little boy. "She often makes
a face, though, as if she wanted to cry and a thousand, thousand times
she begins to when nobody knows why. I don't know why, either, for she
doesn't tell me."

Immediately Cornelli's great shyness of Nika changed into great pity.
If Nika could not even talk about her sorrow, she might have the deepest
sorrow of all.

"Now we shall go to Dino," she said, hurrying to the door which the
little boy had pointed out to her.

"But wait! I shall first show you our big picture book. You'll love
it," Mux assured her. "There is something in it that looks just like
you; it is an owl that has rags over its eyes like you. But you must
not talk about it, because Mama has forbidden it."

"No, no, I don't want to see the book. Please take me to Dino now,"
Cornelli urged.

Mux pulled Cornelli away from the kitchen at last and, not far from
there, opened a door.

"Are you coming at last, Cornelli?" Dino cried to her. He was sitting
up in bed. He glanced happily at his approaching friend, and Cornelli,
too, felt deep joy at seeing him again. The hours she had spent with
him had been the only happy ones she had had all summer. Quickly sitting
down by his bed, she began to relate to him everything that had happened
in Iller-Stream since his departure. Dino asked many questions that
Cornelli had to answer, and the time went by they knew not how.

Mux had disappeared. As long as he could not have his new friend's
whole attention, he preferred to find out what was being prepared for
dinner in the kitchen.

Now the mother entered the room.

"I have hardly seen you yet, dear child," she said, taking Cornelli's
hand, "but I thought I would leave you and Dino undisturbed for a
little while. You must have many things to talk over about your
experiences and friends in Iller-Stream. Dino has looked forward so
much to your visit. Please come to lunch now. Dino has to sleep a
little while afterwards, and then you can go back to him again, if you
wish."

A difficult moment had now come for Cornelli. She had secretly hoped
that she would be able to spend all day alone with Dino, and that
nobody else would notice her. Now she had to sit at table with Dino's
mother and sisters. Mux, however, was her consolation; he seemed so
confiding and so friendly. She had felt immediately to her great
discomfort how different and how horrible she looked in comparison
with these charming children. When she had stood in front of Nika, who
was so very pretty, she felt sure that the elder girl must be filled
with disgust at the sight of her, even if she did not show it. Mux had
seen her peculiarity immediately and had remarked upon it. And now
Agnes would be there, too.

That Agnes, as well as the proud-looking Nika, had a secret sorrow
made Cornelli feel as if there were a bond between them. This gave her
a little courage to follow Dino's mother, who was waiting in the
doorway. When Cornelli entered Agnes was standing, full of expectation,
in the middle of the room. Going up to the visitor, she shook her hand.

"I am so glad you came, Cornelli," she said with animation. "Dino has
talked so much about you that we, too, wanted to meet you."

"I want to sit beside you," said Mux, dragging his chair to Cornelli's
side.

"Just stay where you are! That is my seat," Agnes cut him short. She
could not be misunderstood, for she pushed back the chair and Mux quite
vigorously.

The mother had again gone out to the kitchen, so he could not get her
help, which made him very angry.

"Yes, yes, you always want to order everybody around all the time,"
he cried out furiously, "and you even broke somebody on the wheel,
once."

Now the mother entered.

"Oh, Mama, Mux is saying such frightful things. Shouldn't he go to
bed?" Agnes called to her.

Mux was just gathering up his strength to fight against this proposed
punishment, when the mother cut short their quarrel.

"No, no," she said kindly. "To-day Cornelli is here for the first time
and it is a feast day for us. Mux shall not go to bed, but he must sit
down quietly in his chair and say grace; then all will be well."

Mux was soon calmed by the soothing words and the good soup's delicious
odor which penetrated his nostrils. So he said grace in quite a
tolerable manner. Cornelli had been very much touched by his desire
to sit beside her. She was anxious to do him a favor, too, and she
tried to think of something that might please him.

Directly after lunch Nika and Agnes had to hurry off to school again
and the mother had to supervise Trina's work, so Mux was entrusted
with the task of entertaining Cornelli for a little while. That suited
him exactly.

"Now, I'll show you that Agnes has really broken a man on the wheel,"
he said triumphantly.

"But I don't believe it, Mux. And why should the man have held still?"
asked Cornelli.

"You can read it here. See, it is written there!" said Mux, placing
his picture book on Cornelli's lap and pointing to a splendid colored
picture. "Read what is written here," he directed. "Dino once read it
aloud to me and then I knew it."

Cornelli read aloud: "Agnes orders Rudolph von Warth to be bound to
the wheel."

"Now you see it," Mux said complacently.

Cornelli did not quite know what the picture was supposed to mean, so
she began to read the story that explained it. She read more eagerly
each instant, for it was described so vividly that she had to consume
one page after another.

"Now you know it," said Mux a little impatiently. "Now look at the goat
wagon."

"But Mux," Cornelli said eagerly, "it is quite a different Agnes, it
is a queen. You must never think any more that your sister has done
such a dreadful thing."

"Oh, but look at the goat wagon, now," begged Mux, a little
disappointed.

"Why is the child here crying on the road? Just look how he is pressing
his hands up to his eyes! Oh, he is so unhappy! Do you know why?"

Mux shook his head.

"Then I have to read it quickly," said Cornelli. She became so absorbed
in the story that she did not notice how Mux was pulling her and urging
her to stop reading; he even shook the book.

The mother came into the room now and said: "Dino has shortened his
rest a little, for he is longing to see you again, Cornelli. Will you
come?"

Cornelli immediately shut the book, for she was extremely glad to go
to her friend. She felt some regret, however, at having to leave the
story unfinished; she would have loved to know what happened further.

"So you like the book? It was the joy of all my children from the
oldest to the youngest," said the mother. Cornelli's regretful glance
at it had not escaped her. "You can look at it again later on, for we
still have lots of time."

But Cornelli had to talk over so many things with Dino that the time
had passed before they had thought it possible, and it was not long
before Mux came running with the message that supper was ready. The
meal had to be early because Cornelli had to leave immediately after
it.

"Oh, what a shame!" said Cornelli, jumping up because she knew her
father did not like to wait.

"Bring mother here, Mux," said Dino, and the little one departed.
"Wouldn't you like to stay with us a few days, Cornelli? It would be
so nice. Wouldn't you like to? Oh, I think you would!" said Dino
eagerly.

Cornelli had quite a strange sensation. She hardly dared to say yes;
it seemed so incredible to her that everybody in the house should be
so friendly to her and really want her to stay. But that probably would
not last if she remained and they got to know her better. Soon the
mother came in with Mux. The little boy had heard Dino's last words
to Cornelli and had already announced to his mother that Cornelli was
sure to stay, because Dino would not let her go.

"Oh, I am so glad that you have settled it all between you! I am so
pleased that you are going to stay, Cornelli," she said, full of joy.
"I was just going to propose it to you, and I am so glad that Dino has
persuaded you. Your father has already given me his permission and all
I have to do is to let him know right away. Now you can stay quietly
together, for there is no hurry about supper."

The mother immediately wrote to Mr. Hellmut, and soon after that, fat
little Trina was running over to the hotel.

Cornelli had again settled down beside Dino with a mixed feeling of
wonderful delight and fear. He noticed her timidity.

"Oh, yes, Dino, I love to stay with you and Mux," she assured him.
"Your mother is so good to me, too, but I am afraid of your two sisters.
I have to think of poor little block-headed Trina all the time, when
she does everything wrong and does not know how to do otherwise; you
all despise her for it and she can't help it. I know what it is like
to be so block-headed."

Dino had to laugh a little.

"Why do you suddenly think of our Trina?" he asked. "Do not worry about
her, for mother is very good to her. Just be happy, Cornelli, and do
not imagine all kinds of things about block-headed Trina."

Cornelli did not say another word, but Dino noticed that she kept on
thinking just the same. After a while the mother came to announce that
it was time for Dino's rest. The prospect of seeing each other again
on the following day was a great consolation to them both.

Then Cornelli and the mother went back to the room where the sisters
were sitting at their school work. Mux was bending over his picture
book, hatching out new ideas, no doubt. Just then the half grown Trina
entered with a basket on her arm. While she was passing Nika's chair,
her basket got caught on it. Pulling violently to free it, she turned
the chair around quite suddenly.

"You are getting more awkward every day, Trina," Nika said crossly.

Cornelli blushed. She felt as if these words were meant for her as
well. She must be just as awkward in Nika's eyes as Trina was. The
latter failed to excuse herself and from embarrassment became more
clumsy in her movements. Cornelli understood this perfectly; that was
what she always did, she knew it quite well.

"Now we shall have supper," said the mother, "and when the children's
work is done we shall all sing together. Don't you sing, too, Cornelli?"

"I probably do not know the songs, and so I can't sing," she replied
shyly.

After supper Mux fled back to Cornelli with his book. He wanted to
renew his conversation with her, but his mother had a different plan.

"Give your book to Cornelli, for it is time for you to retire," she
said. "You can join us again to-morrow."

Mux departed reluctantly.

When his mother was firmly leading him away, he was still able to call
to Cornelli: "Be sure not to go till I come back!"

Cornelli felt quite frightened when her confiding little friend had
gone. Now for the first time she was left alone with the two sisters.
She wondered what would happen. But nothing happened. They were both
so deeply occupied with their work that they did not even raise their
heads. Cornelli now remembered the lovely story book. She had already
begun a story and she simply had to know how it would end. So she began
to read. As soon as she finished one story, a new wonderful picture
would lead her to another story.

Suddenly some splendid music sounded close beside her, and Cornelli
started. Agnes was sitting at the piano close to her side and playing.
Cornelli could not read any more, for Agnes played one lovely tune
after another as quickly and easily as if it did not cause her any
trouble. She knew from Dino that Agnes was not much more than a year
older than she was. She listened with admiration to the beautiful
melodies that were pouring forth from the instrument. Finally the
mother returned. She had made her nightly visit to Dino and had had
several things to say to him.

"Mama," Agnes called to her eagerly, "I am playing all the merry pieces
I know to-night, for I have just finished my long composition."

"You are right, Agnes. And how are you getting along with your painting,
Nika?" asked the mother.

Nika replied quite sadly that she had hoped to finish it that day, but
the days were very short now and she could not paint by lamp light.
