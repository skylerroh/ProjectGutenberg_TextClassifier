The heifer's horns, he cries in accents of command:

LII. "Son of a goddess, if none risks the fray,
    How long shall Dares guerdonless remain?
    What end of standing? Must I wait all day?
    Bring the prize hither." Straight the Dardan train
    Shout for their champion, and his claim sustain.
    Then to Entellus, seated at his side,
    Couched on the green grass, in reproachful strain
    Thus sternly spake Acestes, fired with pride,
And fain, for manhood sake, his younger friend to chide:

LIII. "Entellus, once our bravest, but in vain,
    Can'st _thou_ sit tamely, with the field unfought,
    And see this braggart glory in his gain?
    Where is thy god, that Eryx? Hath he taught
    Thine arm its vaunted cleverness for naught?
    To us what booteth thy Trinacrian name,
    Thy spoil-hung house, thy roof with prizes fraught?"
    Entellus said: "My spirit is the same.
Fear hath not quenched my fire, nor checked the love of fame.

LIV. "But numbing age hath made the blood run cold,
    And turned my strength to dulness and decay.
    Had I the youth that stirred these bones of old,
    The youth _he_ boasts, no need of guerdon, nay,
    Nor comely steer to tempt me to the fray.
    Glory I care for, not a gift," he cried,
    And, rising, hurled into the ring midway
    Two ponderous gauntlets, stiff with hardened hide;
These Eryx wore, these thongs around his wrists he tied.

LV. All stood amazed, so huge the weight, so vast,
    Sevenfold with lead and iron overlaid,
    The bull's tough hide. E'en Dares shrank aghast.
    Forth stepped AEneas, and the gauntlets weighed,
    And to and fro the ponderous folds he swayed.
    Then gruffly spake the veteran once more:
    "Ah! had ye seen great Hercules arrayed
    In arms like these, such gauntlets as he wore,
And watched the deadly fight waged here upon the shore!

LVI. "These Eryx wore, thy brother, when that day
    He faced Alcides in the strife;--see now
    His blood and brains,--with these I dared the fray
    When better blood gave vigour, nor the snow
    Of envious eld was sprinkled on my brow.
    Still, if this Trojan doth these arms decline,
    And good AEneas and our host allow,
    Match we the fight. These gauntlets I resign,
Put fear away, and doff those Trojan gloves of thine."

LVII. So saying, Entellus from his shoulders flung
    His quilted doublet, and revealed to light
    The massive joints, the sinews firmly strung,
    The bones and muscles, and the limbs of might,
    And, like a giant, stood prepared for fight.
    Two gloves for either champion, matched in weight,
    AEneas brings, and binds them firm and tight.
    So, face to face, each eager and elate,
Like-armed the rivals stand, on tiptoe for debate.

LVIII. Each from the blow the towering head draws back,
    Fearless, with arms uplifted to the skies.
    Spars hand through hand, and tempts to the attack,
    One, nimbler-footed, on his youth relies;
    Entellus' strength is in his limbs and size.
    But the knees shake beneath him, and are slow,
    And age the wanted energy denies.
    He heaves for breath; thick pantings come and go,
And shake the labouring breast, as hailing blow on blow.

LIX. In vain they strive for mastery. Loud sound
    Their hollow sides; the battered chests ring back,
    As here and there the whistling strokes pelt round
    Their ears and temples, and the jaw-bones crack.
    Firm stands Entellus, though his knees are slack;
    Still in the same strained posture, he defies,
    Unmoved, the tempest of his foe's attack.
    Only his body and his watchful eyes
Slip from the purposed stroke, and shun the wished surprise.

LX. As one who strives with battery to o'erthrow
    A high-walled city, or close siege doth lay
    Against some mountain-stronghold; even so
    Sly Dares shifts, an opening to essay,
    And vainly varies his assault each way.
    On tiptoe stretched, Entellus, pricked with pride,
    Puts forth his right hand, with resistless sway
    Steep from his shoulder. But the foe, quick-ey'd,
Foresees the coming blow, and lightly leaps aside.

LXI. On empty air Entellus wastes his strength.
    Down goes the giant, baulked of his design,
    Fallen like a giant, and lies stretched at length.
    So, torn from earth, on Ida's height divine
    Or Erymanthus, falls the hollow pine.
    Up spring each rival's countrymen. Loud cheers
    The welkin rend, and, bursting through the line,
    Forth runs Acestes, and his friend uprears,
Pitying his fallen worth and fellowship of years.

LXII. Fearless, unshaken, with his soul aflame
    For vengeance, up Entellus springs again,
    And conscious valour and the sense of shame
    Rouse all his strength as, burning with disdain,
    He drives huge Dares headlong o'er the plain,
    Now right, now left, keeps pummelling his foe;
    No stint, no stay; as rattling hailstones rain
    On roof-tops, so with many a ceaseless blow
Each hand in turn he plies, and pounds him to and fro.

LXIII. But good AEneas suffered not too far
    The strife to rage, not let Entellus slake
    His wrath, but rescued Dares from the war,
    Sore-spent, and thus in soothing terms bespake,
    "Poor friend! what madness doth thy mind o'ertake?
    Feel'st not that more than mortal is his aid?
    The gods are with him, and thy cause forsake.
    Yield then to heaven and desist."--He said,
And with his voice straightway the deadly strife allayed.

LXIV. Then, stirred with pity, the Dardanian throng
    Their vanquished kinsman from the contest bore.
    His sick knees wearily he drags along,
    Feeble and helpless, for his wound is sore;
    And loosened teeth and clots of curdled gore
    Spout forth, as o'er his shoulders nods each way
    The drooping head. They lead him to the shore,
    His gifts, the sword and helmet; but the bay
And bull Entellus takes, the victor of the day.

LXV. Forth steps the champion, glorying in the prize,
    Pride in his port, defiance on his brow.
    "See, Goddess-born; ye Teucrians, mark," he cried,
    "What strength Entellus in his youth could show;
    How dire a doom ye warded from his foe."
    He spake and, standing opposite the bull,
    Swung back his arm, and, rising to the blow,
    Betwixt the horns with hardened glove smote full,
And back upon the brain drove in the splintered skull.

LXVI. Down drops the beast, and on the earth lies low,
    Quivering but dead. Then o'er him, as he lay,
    Entellus cries "O Eryx, hear my vow.
    This life, for Dares, I devote this day,
    A nobler victim and a worthier prey.
    Accept it thou who taught'st this arm to wield
    The gloves of death. Unvanquished in the fray
    These withered arms their latest offering yield,
These gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field."

LXVII. Next cries AEneas to the crowd: "Come now,
    Whoso hath mind in archer's feats to vie,
    Step forth, and prove his cunning with the bow":
    Then sets the prizes: on the beach hard by
    With stalwart arms he rears a mast on high,
    Ta'en from Serestus' vessel, and thereto
    A fluttering pigeon with a string doth tie,
    Mark for their shafts. Around the rivals drew,
And in a brazen helm the gathered lots they threw.

LXIII. Out leap the names; cheers hail the first in place,
    Hippocoon, son of Hyrtacus renowned;
    Then Mnestheus, victor in the naval race,
    Mnestheus, his brows with olive wreath still crowned.
    Third in the casque Eurytion's lot is found
    Thy brother, famous Pandarus, whose dart,
    Hurled at the Danaans, did the truce confound.
    Last comes Acestes, for with dauntless heart
Still in the toils of youth the veteran claims his part.

LXIX. Forth step the marksmen, and with bows well-bent,
    Draw forth their arrows, and their aim prepare.
    Loud twanged the cord, as first Hippocoon sent
    His feathered shaft, that through the flowing air
    Went whistling on, and pierced the mast, and there
    Stuck fast. The stout tree quivered, and the bird
    Flapped with her wings in terror and despair,
    Fluttering for freedom, and around were heard
Shouts, as admiring joy the clamorous concourse stirred.

LXX. Next him stood Mnestheus, eager for the prize,
    And straight the bowstring to his breast updrew,
    Aiming aloft. The lightning of his eyes
    Went with the arrow, as he twanged the yew.
    Ah pity! Fortune sped the shaft untrue.
    The bird he missed, but cut the flaxen ties
    That held the feet, and cleft the knots in two.
    And forth, exulting, through the windy skies,
Into the darkening clouds the loosened captive flies.

LXXI. Then, quick as thought, his arrow on the string,
    Eurytion to his brother breathed a prayer,
    Marking the pigeon, as she clapped her wing
    Beneath a cloud, he pierced her. Breathless there
    She drops; her life is with the stars of air,
    The bolt is in her breast. Acestes now
    Alone remains; no palm is left to bear,
    Yet skyward shoots the veteran, proud to show
What skill his hand can boast, the sounding of his bow.

LXXII. Sudden a portent was revealed; how great
    An augury, the future brought to light,
    And frightening seers their omens sang too late.
    Aloft, the arrow kindled in its flight,
    Then marked with shining trail its pathway bright,
    And, wasting, vanished into viewless air.
    So stars, unfastened from the vault of night,
    Stream in the firmament with fiery glare,
And through the dark fling out a length of glittering hair.

LXXIII. Awed stand the men of Sicily and Troy,
    And pray the gods. AEneas owns the sign,
    And, heaping gifts, Acestes clasps with joy.
    "Take, father, take; Jove's auspices divine
    A special honour for thy meed assign.
    This bowl, embossed with images of gold,
    The gift of old Anchises, shall be thine,
    Which Thracian Cisseus to my sire of old
Gave, as a pledge of love, to have it and to hold."

LXXIV. So saying, with a garland of green bay
    He crowned his temples, and the prize conferred,
    And named Acestes victor of the day.
    Nor good Eurytion to the choice demurred,
    Nor grudged to see the veteran's claim preferred,
    Though his the prowess that the rest surpassed,
    His shaft the one that struck the soaring bird.
    The second, he who cut the cord, the last,
He who with feathered reed transfixed the tapering mast.

LXXV. But good AEneas, ere the games are done,
    The child of Epytus, companion dear
    And trusty guardian of his beardless son,
    Calls to his side, and whispers in his ear:
    "Go bid Ascanius, if his troop be here
    And steeds in readiness, with spear and shield
    In honour of his grandsire to appear."
    Then, calling to the thronging crowd to yield
Free space, he clears the course, and open lies the field.

LXXVI. Forth ride the boys, before their fathers' eyes,
    Reining their steeds. In radiant files they fare,
    And wondering murmurs from each host arise.
    All with stript leaves have bound the flowing hair.
    Two cornel javelins, tipt with steel, they bear,
    Some, polished quivers; and a pliant chain
    Of twisted gold around the neck they wear;
    Three companies--three captains scour the plain.
Twelve youths, behind each chief, compose the glittering train.

LXXVII. One shouting troop young Priam's lead obeys,
    Thy son, Polites, from his grandsire hight,
    And born erelong Italia's fame to raise.
    A dappled Thracian charger bears the knight,
    His pasterns flecked and forehead starred with white.
    Next Atys, whom the Atian line reveres,
    The youthful idol of a youth's delight,
    So well Iulus loved him. Last appears
Iulus, first in grace and comeliest of his peers.

LXXVIII. His a Sidonian charger; Dido fair
    This pledge and token of her love supplied.
    Trinacrian horses his attendants bear,
    Acestes' gift. Their bosoms throb with pride,
    While Dardans, cheering, welcome as they ride
    The sires that have been in the sons that are.
    So, when before their kinsfolk on each side
    Their ranks had passed, Epytides afar
Cracks the loud whip, and shouts the signal, as for war.

LXXIX. In equal bands the triple troops divide,
    Then turn, and rallying, with spears bent low,
    Charge at the call. Now back again they ride,
    Wheel round, and weave new courses to and fro,
    In armed similitude of martial show,
    Circling and intercircling. Now in flight
    They bare their backs, now turning, foe to foe,
    Level their lances to the charge, now plight
The truce, and side by side in friendly league unite.

LXXX. E'en as in Crete the Labyrinth of old
    Between blind walls its secret hid from view,
    With wildering ways and many a winding fold,
    Wherein the wanderer, if the tale be true,
    Roamed unreturning, cheated of the clue:
    Such tangles weave the Teucrians, as they feign
    Fighting or flying, and the game renew:
    So dolphins, sporting on the watery plain,
Cleave the Carpathian waves and distant Libya's main.

LXXXI. These feats Ascanius to his people showed,
    When girdling Alba Longa; there with joy
    The ancient Latins in the pastime rode,
    Wherein the princely Dardan, as a boy,
    Was wont his Trojan comrades to employ.
    To Alban children from their sires it came,
    And mighty Rome took up the "game of Troy,"
    And called the players "Trojans," and the name
Lives on, as sons renew the hereditary game.

LXXXII. Thus far to blest Anchises they defrayed
    The funeral rites; when Fortune turned unkind,
    Forsook her faith. For while the games were played
    Before the tomb, Saturnian Juno's mind
    New schemes, to glut her ancient wrath, designed.
    Iris she calls, and bids the Goddess go
    Down to the Ilian fleet, and breathes a wind
    To waft her on. So, borne upon her bow
Of myriad hues, unseen, the maiden hastes below.

LXXXIII. She eyes the concourse, marks the ships unmanned,
    And sees the empty harbour and the shore.
    While far off on the solitary strand
    The Trojan dames sat sorrowful, and o'er
    The deep sea gazed, and, gazing, evermore
    Wept for the Sire. "Ah, woe! the fields of foam!
    The waste of waters for the wearied oar!
    Oh! for a city and a certain home;
A rest for sea-worn souls, for weary 'tis to roam!"

LXXXIV. So, not unversed in mischief, from the skies
    Amidst the gathered matrons down she came,
    In raiment and in face to mortal eyes
    No more a Goddess, but an aged dame,
    The wife of Doryclus, of Tmarian fame.
    E'en venerable Beroe, once blest
    With rank, and children and a noble name.
    So changed in semblance, the celestial guest
Mixed with the Dardan dames, and thus the crowd addressed:

LXXXV. "Oh, born to sorrow! whom th' Achaian foe
    Dragged not to death, when Ilion was o'erthrown!
    O hapless race! what still extremer woe
    Doth Fortune doom the living to bemoan?
    Since Ilion fell, seven summers nigh have flown,
    And we o'er every ocean, every plain,
    Past cheerless rocks, and under stars unknown,
    Oft and so oft are driven, as in vain
Italia's shores we grasp, and welter on the main!

LXXXVI. "'Tis Eryx' land, Acestes is our host.
    What hinders for the homeless here to gain
    A home--an Ilion for the one we lost?
    O fatherland! O home-gods saved in vain,
    If still in endless exile we remain!
    Ah! nevermore shall I behold with joy
    A Xanthus and a Simois again,
    Our Hector's streams? ne'er hear the name of Troy?
Up! let devouring flames these ill-starred ships destroy!

LXXXVII. "Methought in sleep, Cassandra's ghost came near,
    With torches in her hands, and bade me seize
    The flaming firebrands, and exclaimed: 'See, here
    Thy Troy, the home that destiny decrees!
    The hour is ripe; such prodigies as these
    Brook not delay. Lo! here to Neptune rise
    Four altars. He, the Sovereign of the seas,
    Himself the firebrands and the will supplies.'"
Then straight, with arm drawn back, and fury in her eyes,

LXXXVIII. She waved a torch, and hurled it. Dazed with fear,
    The women trembled as she tossed the flame.
    Then one who nursed through many a bygone year
    The sons of Priam--Pyrgo was the dame,--
    "No Trojan this, nor Beroe her name,
    The wife of Doryclus. Full sure I ween
    Immortal birth her sparkling eyes proclaim.
    What breathing beauty! what celestial sheen!
Mark her majestic voice, and more than mortal mien!

LXXXIX. "Myself but now left Beroe, worn out
    With sickness, grieving in her heart to miss
    These funeral honours to our Sire."--In doubt
    They waver, and with eyes that bode amiss
    Look towards the vessels and the blue abyss
    Of ocean, torn in spirit 'twixt the love
    Of realms that shall be and the land that is.
    On even wings the goddess soared above,
And with her rainbow vast the cloudy drift she clove.

XC. Then, by the monstrous prodigy dismayed,
    And driven by madness, forth the matrons fare
    With shouts and shrieks. The houses they invade,
    And living embers from the hearthstones tear,
    With impious hands these strip the altars bare,
    And boughs, and leaves and lighted brands they cast
    In heaps, and fuel for the flames prepare.
    O'er bench and oar, from painted keel to mast,
The Fire-god raves at will, and rides upon the blast.

XCI. Meanwhile, with tidings of the fleet in flames,
    Swift posts Eumelus. To the tomb he hies
    Of old Anchises, and the crowded games.
    Back look the Trojans, and with awe-struck eyes
    See the dark ash-cloud floating through the skies.
    And, as his troop Ascanius joyed to lead
    In mimic fight, so keen, when danger cries,
    First to the wildered camp he spurs his steed;
And breathless guardians fail to stay his headlong speed.

XCII. "What madness this, poor women?" he exclaims,
    "What mean ye now? No camp of Argive foe,
    _Your_ hopes ye doom to perish in the flames.
    See your Ascanius!"--At his feet below
    He flung the helmet, that adorned his brow
    When mimic fight he marshalled. Hurrying came
    AEneas, hurrying came the host; but lo!
    The shore lies bare; this way and that each dame
Slinks to the woods and caves, if aught can hide her shame.

XCIII. All loathe the daylight and the deed unblest.
    Sobered, they know their countrymen at last,
    And Juno's power is shaken from each breast.
    Not so the flames; with gathered strength and fast
    Onward still swept the unconquerable blast.
    Forth puffed between the timbers, drenched in vain,
    The smoke-jets from the smouldering tow. Down passed
    From keel to cabin the devouring bane.
Nor floods nor heroes' strength the mastering flames restrain.

XCIV. Then good AEneas from his shoulders threw
    His robe, and heavenward stretched his hands in prayer;
    "Great Jove! if spares thy vengeance to pursue
    Troy's children to the uttermost, if e'er
    The toils of mortals move thy ancient care,
    Preserve this feeble remnant, and command
    These flames from further havoc to forbear;
    Else, if my deeds deserve it, bare thine hand,
Launch thine avenging bolt, and slay me as I stand."

XCV. Scarce spake he, when in torrents comes the rain.
    Darkly the tempest riots, and the roar
    Of thunder shakes the mountains and the plain.
    Black storm-clouds from the thickening South sweep o'er
    The darkened heavens, and down a deluge pour.
    Drenched are the decks; the timbers, charr'd with heat,
    Are soaked and smoulder, till the fire no more
    Raves, and the flames are conquered, and the fleet,
Save four alone, survives the fiery plague complete.

XCVI. Sore-struck, AEneas in his breast debates
    This way and that, still doubtful to remain
    In fields Sicilian, mindless of the Fates,
    Or strive the shores of Italy to gain,
    Then aged Nautes, wisest of his train,
    Taught by Tritonian Pallas to unfold
    What wrathful gods or destinies ordain,
    In prescient utterance his response unrolled,
And thus with cheerful words the anxious chief consoled:

XCVII. "O Goddess-born, where Fate directs the way,
    'Tis ours to follow. Who the best can bear,
    Best conquers Fortune, be the doom what may.
    A friend thou hast, Acestes; bid him share
    And be a willing partner of thy care.
    He too is Trojan, and of seed divine.
    Give him the lost ships' crews, and whosoe'er
    Is faint or feeble, to his charge consign,
Old men and sea-sick dames, who glory's quest decline.

XCVIII. "Here let them rest, who care not for renown,
    And build their walls, and, if our host assent,
    Acesta from Acestes name the town."
    Such counsel cheered him, but his breast is rent
    With trouble, musing on the dark event.
    And now black Night, upon her course midway,
    With ebon car had climbed the steep ascent,
    When, gliding down before him as he lay,
His father's phantom stood, and speaking, seemed to say:

XCIX. "O dearer than the life, while life remained,
    My son, by Troy's hard destinies sore tried,
    Hither I come at Jove's command, who deigned
    Thy burning ships to save, and pitying-eyed
    Beholds thy sorrows. Hear then, nor deride
    The grey-haired Nautes, for his words are good.
    Choice youths, the bravest, for thy quest provide.
    Stout hearts ye need in Italy, for rude
And rough the Latin race, and hard to be subdued.

C.  "But seek thou first the nether realms of Dis,
    And through Avernus tread the dark domain
    To meet me. Not in Tartarus' abyss,
    Sad shades of sin and never-ending pain,
    I dwell, but on the blest Elysian plain
    Join with the just in fellowship. Now heed:
    There the chaste Sibyl, if with victims slain,
    Black sheep, ye seek her, shall thy footsteps lead,
And show thy destined walls and progeny decreed.

CI. "And now farewell; for dewy Night midway
    Wheels on her course, and from the Orient sky
    Fierce beats the breathing of the steeds of Day."
    He spake, and melted as a mist on high.
    "Ah, whither," cried AEneas, "wilt thou fly?
    Who tears thee hence? Where hurriest thou again?"
    So saying, he wakes the embers ere they die.
    And offering frankincense and sacred grain,
Troy's household gods adores, and hoary Vesta's fane.

CII. Forthwith he tells Acestes, then the crews,
