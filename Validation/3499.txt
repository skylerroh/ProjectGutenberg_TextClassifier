THE BIRDS' CHRISTMAS CAROL




I

A LITTLE SNOW BIRD


It was very early Christmas morning, and in the stillness of the dawn,
with the soft snow falling on the house-tops, a little child was born in
the Bird household.

They had intended to name the baby Lucy, if it were a girl; but they had
not expected her on Christmas morning, and a real Christmas baby was not
to be lightly named--the whole family agreed in that.

They were consulting about it in the nursery. Mr. Bird said that he had
assisted in naming the three boys, and that he should leave this matter
entirely to Mrs. Bird; Donald wanted the child called "Dorothy," after a
pretty, curly-haired girl who sat next him in school; Paul choose
"Luella," for Luella was the nurse who had been with him during his
whole babyhood, up to the time of his first trousers, and the name
suggested all sorts of comfortable things. Uncle Jack said that the
first girl should always be named for her mother, no matter how hideous
the name happened to be.

Grandma said that she would prefer not to take any part in the
discussion, and everybody suddenly remembered that Mrs. Bird had thought
of naming the baby Lucy, for Grandma herself; and, while it would be
indelicate for her to favor that name, it would be against human nature
for her to suggest any other, under the circumstances.

Hugh, the "hitherto baby," if that is a possible term, sat in one corner
and said nothing, but felt, in some mysterious way, that his nose was
out of joint; for there was a newer baby now, a possibility he had never
taken into consideration; and the "first girl," too,--a still higher
development of treason, which made him actually green with jealousy.

But it was too profound a subject to be settled then and there, on the
spot; besides, Mamma had not been asked, and everybody felt it rather
absurd, after all, to forestall a decree that was certain to be
absolutely wise, just, and perfect.

The reason that the subject had been brought up at all so early in the
day lay in the fact that Mrs. Bird never allowed her babies to go over
night unnamed. She was a person of so great decision of character that
she would have blushed at such a thing; she said that to let blessed
babies go dangling and dawdling about without names, for months and
months, was enough to ruin them for life. She also said that if one
could not make up one's mind in twenty-four hours it was a sign
that--But I will not repeat the rest, as it might prejudice you against
the most charming woman in the world.

So Donald took his new velocipede and went out to ride up and down the
stone pavement and notch the shins of innocent people as they passed by,
while Paul spun his musical top on the front steps.

But Hugh refused to leave the scene of action. He seated himself on the
top stair in the hall, banged his head against the railing a few times,
just by way of uncorking the vials of his wrath, and then subsided into
gloomy silence, waiting to declare war if more "first girl babies" were
thrust upon a family already surfeited with that unnecessary article.

Meanwhile dear Mrs. Bird lay in her room, weak, but safe and happy, with
her sweet girl baby by her side and the heaven of motherhood opening
again before her. Nurse was making gruel in the kitchen, and the room
was dim and quiet. There was a cheerful open fire in the grate, but
though the shutters were closed, the side windows that looked out on the
