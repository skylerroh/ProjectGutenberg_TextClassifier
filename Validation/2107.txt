like that, with such an awful life before her!"

"The other one was bright and pretty, too, and she can use her bow and
arrows."

"Full-blooded Indian.  As full of fight as a wild-cat, and twice as
dangerous."

"Now, Murray, what do you think we'd better do?"

"Do?  I wish I could say.  My head's all in a whirl somehow.  I want a
chance to do some thinking."

"Time enough for that."

"Not if we keep right on after the Apaches.  I'll tell you what, Steve,
my mind won't be easy till I've had another look at the ledge.  I want to
know what they've done."

"The Buckhorn Mine?  I'd like to see it, too."

"Then we'll let their outfit go by us, and ride straight back to it.
Might as well save time and follow those fellows up the pass.  Plenty of
hiding-places."

It was a bold thing to do, but they did it, and they were lying safely in
a deep ravine that led out of the pass, a few hours later, when the
"mining outfit" slowly trundled on its downward way.

Long before that, however, Bill and his two friends had made their report
to Captain Skinner.

They had a well made up story to tell him, but it was not very easy for
him to believe it.

"Met the two mining fellers, did ye?  And they're friends with the
'Paches.  Wouldn't let 'em do ye any harm.  How many redskins was there?"

"Three.  We never fired a shot at 'em nor struck a blow, but one of thar
squaws fired an arrer through my arm."

"It's the onlikeliest yarn I ever listened to."

"Thar's the hole in my arm."

"Not that.  It isn't queer an Apache wanted to shoot ye.  I can believe
that.  But that you had sense enough not to fire first at a redskin.  You
never had so much before in all your life."

"Here we are, safe--all three."

"That's pretty good proof.  If there'd been a fight they'd ha' been too
much for you, with two white men like them to help.  Well, we'll go right
on down.  It's our only show."

"That isn't all, Cap."

"What more is there?"

"The old fellow told me to warn you that thar was danger comin' behind
us.  He seems to know all about us and about what we did to the ledge."

"We're followed, are we?  What did he say about the mine?"

"Said he'd take his chances about that.  We agreed to be friends if we
met him and his mate again."

"You did?  Now, Bill, you've shown good-sense again.  What's the matter
with you to-day?  I never heard of such a thing?  It's like finding that
mine just where I didn't expect to."

Bill's two associates said nothing.  They were quite willing he should do
the talking, so long as he did not tell how they had been knocked down
and tied up.  But one of them had to pucker up his mouth for a sort of
silent whistle when he heard Captain Skinner praise them for their wisdom
in keeping the peace with the Apaches.

Perhaps all three of them, too, were thinking of what they should say if
the exact truth about that morning's work should ever leak out.

Danger behind them.  They did not know exactly what, but their
consciences told them what it ought to be.  That made it grow bigger and
bigger the longer they thought of it.

Danger before them in the shape of wandering Apaches; but they had
expected to meet that sort of thing, and were ready for it.  Only they
hoped to dodge it in some way, and to get safely across the border into
Mexico with their stolen treasure.

They had at least made sure of their wonderful mine, and that was
something.  Sooner or later they would all come back and claim it again,
and dig fortunes out of it.  The two miners would not be able to prove
anything.  There was no danger from them.

Perhaps not; and yet, as soon as they had fairly disappeared down the
pass, below the spot where Steve and Murray were hiding, the latter
exclaimed, "Now, Steve, we won't rest our horses till we get there."

They would be quite likely to need rest by that time, for the old man
seemed to be in a tremendous hurry.

Steve would hardly have believed anything could excite the veteran to
such a pitch, if it had not been that he felt so much of the "gold-fever"
in his own veins.  It seemed to him as if he were really thirsty for
another look at that wonderful ledge.

They turned their horses out to feed on the sweet, fresh grass at last,
and pushed forward on foot to the mine.

"They've done it, Steve!"

"I see they have.  Our title's all gone!"

He spoke mournfully and angrily; but Murray replied,

"Gone?  Why, my boy, those rascals have only been doing our work for us."

"For us?  How's that?"

"It was ours.  They've set up our monuments, and dug our shafts, and put
in a blast for us.  They haven't taken anything away from us.  I'll show
you."

He had taken from a pocket of his buckskins a small, narrow chisel as he
spoke, and now he picked up a round stone to serve as a hammer.

"I'm going to make a record, Steve.  I'll tell you what to do about it as
I go along."

Captain Skinner's miners had been hard workers, but Steve had never seen
anybody ply a chisel as Murray did.  He was not trying to make pretty
letters, but they were all deeply cut and clearly legible.

On the largest stone of the central monument, and on the side monuments,
and then on the face of the cliff near the ledge, he cut the name of the
mine, "The Buckhorn," and below that on the cliff and one monument he cut
the date of discovery and Steve Harrison's name.

"Put on yours too, Murray."

"Well, if you say so.  It may be safer.  Only I turn all my rights over
to you.  I'll do it on paper if I ever get a chance."

"I only want my share."

All the while he was chiselling so skilfully and swiftly Murray was
explaining to Steve how he was to act when he reached the settlements,
and how he should make a legal record of his ownership of that property.

"You must be careful to describe all these marks exactly; the ruins, too,
the canyon, the lay of the land, the points of the compass--everything.
After all, it may be you'll never be able to work it.  But you're young,
and there's no telling.  The first thing for you to do is to get out of
the scrape you're in now."

Steve felt as if there were no longer any doubt of that.

During the busy hours spent on the ledge by their masters the two horses
had been feeding and resting, and both Murray and Steve felt like
following their example.

"Start a fire, Steve; it'll be perfectly safe.  I'll try for a deer, and
we'll cook enough to carry us for two days."




CHAPTER XIV

The advance of To-la-go-to-de and his Lipans that day had been a slow
one.  It grew slower and more cautious as hour after hour and mile
after mile of rugged mountain riding went by without any word from the
two pale-face scouts.

The chief himself grew uneasy, and he would have sent another party in
search of No Tongue and the Yellow Head but for fear of defeating the
very object he had in view.

They, he thought, would surely return or send him some word before
nightfall; but the sun was nearly setting when at last he went into
camp with his discontented warriors on the very spot where Steve and
Murray had made their own halt before daylight.

Then, indeed, he could wait no longer, and several braves were ordered
out on foot, with others on horseback, a little behind them, to explore
what was left of the pass and see what they could find.  They could
have done more for their chief and themselves if the night had not been
a somewhat cloudy one, and not a brave of them ventured to descend into
the valley.

If they had done so they might have discovered two very important
facts.  The first was that the Apache hunting village had left it, bag
and baggage, no one could guess whither.  The second, and quite as
important a discovery, would have been that the camping-ground
abandoned by the Apaches had been promptly occupied by a strong party
of pale-faces.

All the scouts could really do was to bring back word that the pass was
clear of enemies to the border of the valley.

That was an anxious night, therefore, for To-la-go-to-de, and it would
hardly have been less so if he had known all about the doings of No
Tongue and Yellow Head during the day--about their capture and release
of the three miners, and their return to their mine.

The morning would bring news, at all events, for To-la-go-to-de
determined to dash on with all his warriors and find it for himself.

"No Tongue is wise.  He is a great warrior.  Sometimes wise old warrior
gets knocked on the head.  Then he not come back at all."

There was a possibility, as he well knew, that the Apaches themselves
had something to do with the silence of his two pale-face friends; but
the Lipan chief was not the man to lie awake over any such thing as
that; he was not even anxious enough to dream about them after he got
asleep.

Another head had been quite as busy and troubled as that of
To-la-go-to-de all that day, and Captain Skinner also would have given
something for a few minutes' conversation with "them two mining
fellers."

He felt sure they could have given him both information and advice; but
he said to himself, "Of course they won't come nigh our outfit.  They
know we've jumped their claim.  Still, they did the friendly thing with
Bill and the boys, and they sent word they didn't bear us any ill-will.
That's 'cause they feel sure of their own ground.  They're on good
terms with the redskins.  I wish I could say we were."

Well he might, considering how many of them there were in that country,
and how near to him some of them were coming.

All the way down the pass the ragged little "Captain" had ridden in
advance of his men, carefully scanning every rock, and bush, and tree.
At last he paused at the very spot where Bill and his companions had
had their little difficulty.  He seemed to see some signs that needed
studying, and he stooped down and picked up something--only a pair of
strong thongs of buckskin, that looked as if they had been recently
used in tying up something.  He could make very little out of them; but
he noticed the marks of horse's feet going up and out of the forest.

"Signs are getting pretty thick.  Hullo!  An arrow!  Cut in two, and
blood on it.  Bill, isn't this the spot?"

"This 'ere's the very place, Cap.  We came awful nigh havin' a fight
right yer."

"Glad you made out not to have any.  Did those two white men and the
Indians ride away in company?"

"Wal, no.  The redskins rid away first, and the two fellers promised to
foller 'em after a while.  Then I reckon they cut off into the timber.
'Peared like they must ha' been huntin'."

"Most likely they were; and waiting for us to get away, so they could
go back to their mine.  Boys, I'm afraid our claim there won't be worth
a great deal by the time we get back."

"We'll take care of that when we come, Cap.  They said they'd take thar
chances.  We'll jest take ours; that's all."

Slower, more and more cautiously, the mining train again moved forward,
until, from under the last of the pine-trees, Captain Skinner could
look out upon the valley and see that it was empty.

How would he and his men have felt if they could have known that at
that very minute Murray was chipping away with his chisel at his
inscriptions upon the central monument of the great Buckhorn Mine?

"Not a redskin in sight," he remarked.  "If there were any there this
morning they've moved on.  They're always on the move.  Glad of it.
We'll go straight on down.  There must be plenty of ways out of a
valley like that."

No doubt of it; but the first business of those wanderers, after they
reached the spring and unhitched their mule-teams, was to carefully
examine every hoof-mark and foot-print they could find.

The fact that there had been lodges there was proof that the Apaches
were not a war-party, but there was plenty of evidence that they were
numerous enough to be dangerous.

"Glad Bill didn't pick a quarrel with such a band as that," grumbled
Captain Skinner.  "But how did he happen to show so much sense?  I
never suspected him of it."

That was not very complimentary to Bill, and it was evident that the
Captain's opinion of him had not changed.

"Some kind of an accident," he said.  "Nobody need waste any time
looking out for another one just like it."

It was getting late in the day, and a better place for a camp could not
have been found.

"This'll do for to-night, won't it, Cap?" asked one of the miners.

"Of course it will.  We'll try to move east from here, or south, when
we leave it."

"Shall any of the boys go for game?  Must be plenty of it all around."

"Game?  Oh yes; plenty of it, after a hundred Apache hunters have been
riding it down for nobody knows how long!  The redskins leave heaps of
game behind 'em, always."

The bitter sarcasm of the Captain's answer prevented any farther
remarks on the subject of hunting that afternoon.  They had plenty of
fresh meat with them, nevertheless, and there was no reason why they
