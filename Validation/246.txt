HOLLAND.

PART I.


Holland is one of the queerest countries under the sun. It should be
called Odd-land, or Contrary-land; for, in nearly every thing, it is
different from other parts of the world.

In the first place, a large portion of the country is lower than the
level of the sea. Great dikes have been built at a heavy cost of money
and labor, to keep the ocean where it belongs.

On certain parts of the coast it sometimes leans with all its weight
against the land, and it is as much as the poor country can do to stand
the pressure.

Sometimes the dikes give way, or spring a leak, and the most disastrous
results follow. They are high and wide, and the tops of some of them are
covered with buildings and trees. They have even fine public roads upon
them, from which horses may look down upon wayside cottages.

Often the keels of floating ships are higher than the roofs of the
dwellings. The stork, on the house-peak, may feel that her nest is
lifted far out of danger, but the croaking frog in the neighboring
bulrushes is nearer the stars than she.

Water-bugs dart backward and forward above the heads of the chimney
swallows; and willow-trees seem drooping with shame, because they can
not reach so high as the reeds near by.

Ditches, canals, ponds, rivers, and lakes are every-where to be seen.
High, but not dry, they shine in the sunlight, catching nearly all the
bustle and the business, quite scorning the tame fields, stretching
damply beside them. One is tempted to ask: "Which is Holland--the shores
or the water?"

The very verdure that should be confined to the land has made a mistake
and settled upon the fish ponds. In fact the entire country is a kind of
saturated sponge, or, as the English poet Butler called it--

    "A land that rides at anchor, and is moored,
    In which they do not live, but go aboard."

Persons are born, live, and die, and even have their gardens on
canal-boats. Farmhouses, with roofs like great slouched hats pulled over
their eyes, stand on wooden legs, with a tucked up sort of air, as if to
say, "We intend to keep dry if we can."

Even the horses wear a wide stool on each hoof to lift them out of the
mire.

It is a glorious country in summer for bare-footed girls and boys. Such
wadings! Such mimic ship sailing! Such rowing, fishing, and swimming!
Only think of a chain of puddles where one can launch chip boats all
day long, and never make a return trip!

But enough. A full recital would set all Young America rushing in a body
toward the Zuyder Zee.

Directions for Reading.--In reading the first line of page 187, there
will be a slight rising of the voice after each of the words,
_ditches', canals', ponds', rivers'_, and a slight falling of the voice
after _lakes'_.[11]

This rising or falling of the voice is called _inflection_, and may be
indicated as above.

HOLLAND.


PART II.

Dutch cities seem, at first sight, to be a bewildering jumble of
houses, bridges, churches, and ships, sprouting into masts, steeples,
and trees. In some cities boats are hitched, like horses, to their
owners' door-posts, and receive their freight from the upper windows.

[Illustration]

Mothers scream to their children not to swing on the garden gate for
fear they may be drowned. Water roads are more frequent there than
common roads and railroads; water-fences, in the form of lazy green
ditches, inclose pleasure-ground, farm, and garden.

Sometimes fine green hedges are seen; but wooden fences, such as we
have in America, are rarely met with in Holland. As for stone fences, a
Hollander would lift his hands with astonishment at the very idea.

There is no stone there excepting those great masses of rock that have
been brought from other lands to strengthen and protect the coast.

All the small stones or pebbles, if there ever were any, seem to be
imprisoned in pavements, or quite melted away. Boys, with strong, quick
arms, may grow from aprons to full beards without ever finding one to
start the water-rings, or set the rabbits flying.

The water roads are nothing less than canals crossing the country in
every direction. These are of all sizes, from the great North Holland
Ship Canal, which is the wonder of the world, to those which a boy can
leap.

Water-omnibuses constantly ply up and down these roads for the
conveyance of passengers; and water-drays are used for carrying fuel and
merchandise.

Instead of green country lanes, green canals stretch from field to barn,
and from barn to garden; and the farms are merely great lakes pumped
dry. Some of the busiest streets are water, while many of the country
roads are paved with brick.

The city boats, with their rounded sterns, gilded bows, and gayly-painted
sides, are unlike any others under the sun; a Dutch wagon with its
funny little crooked pole is a perfect mystery of mysteries.

One thing is clear, you may think that the inhabitants need never be
thirsty. But no, Odd-land is true to itself still. With the sea pushing
to get in, and the lakes struggling to get out, and the overflowing
canals, rivers, and ditches, in many districts there is no water that is
fit to swallow.

Our poor Hollanders must go dry, or send far inland for that precious
fluid, older than Adam, yet young as the morning dew.

Sometimes, indeed, the inhabitants can swallow a shower, when they are
provided with any means of catching it; but generally they are like the
sailors told of in a famous poem, who saw

    "Water, water, every-where,
    Nor any drop to drink!"

Great flapping windmills all over the country make it look as if flocks
of huge sea birds were just settling upon it. Every-where one sees the
funniest trees, bobbed into all sorts of odd shapes, with their trunks
painted a dazzling' white, yellow, or red.

Horses are often yoked three abreast. Men, women, and children, go
clattering about in wooden shoes with loose heels.

Husbands and wives lovingly harness themselves side by side on the bank
of the canal and drag their produce to market.

THE WIND IN A FROLIC.


  The wind one morning sprung up from sleep,
  Saying, "Now for a frolic! Now for a leap!
  Now for a madcap galloping chase!
  I'll make a commotion in every place!"

  So it swept with a bustle right through a great town,
  Creaking the signs and scattering down
  Shutters, and whisking with merciless squalls,
  Old women's bonnets and gingerbread stalls.
  There never was heard a much lustier shout,
  As the apples and oranges tumbled about.

  Then away to the fields it went blustering and humming,
  And the cattle all wondered whatever was coming.
  It pulled by their tails the grave, matronly cows,
  And tossed the colts' manes all about their brows,
  Till, offended at such a familiar salute,
  They all turned their backs and stood silently mute.

  So on it went, capering and playing its pranks;
  Whistling with  reeds on  the broad  river banks;
  Puffing the birds, as they sat on  the spray,
  Or the traveler grave on the king's highway.
  It was not too nice to hustle the bags
  Of the beggar, and flutter his dirty rags.
  'Twas so bold that it feared not to play its joke
  With the doctor's wig, and the gentleman's cloak.

  Through the forest it roared, and cried gayly, "Now
  You sturdy old oaks, I'll make you bow!"
  And it made them bow without more ado,
  Or it cracked their great branches through and through.

  Then it rushed like a monster o'er cottage and farm,
  Striking their inmates with sudden alarm;
  And they ran out like bees in a midsummer swarm.
  There were dames with their kerchiefs tied over their caps,
  To see if their poultry were free from mishaps;
  The turkeys they gobbled, the geese screamed aloud,
  And the hens crept to roost in a terrified crowd;
  There was raising of ladders, and logs laying on,
  Where the thatch from the roof threatened soon to be gone.

  But the wind had passed on, and had met in a lane
  With a school-boy, who panted and struggled in vain;
  For it tossed him, and whirled him, then passed, and he stood
  With his hat in a pool, and his shoe in the mud.

  Then away went the wind in its holiday glee,
  And now it was far on the billowy sea;
  And the lordly ships felt its powerful blow,
  And the little boats darted to and fro.

  But, lo! it was night, and it sunk to rest
  On the sea-birds' rock in the gleaming west,
  Laughing to think, in its frolicsome fun,
  How little of mischief it really had done.

SOMETHING ABOUT PLANTS.


The name plant belongs in a general way to all vegetation, from the
tiniest spear of grass or creeping flower one sees on the rocks by the
brook-side, to the largest and tallest of forest trees.

Plants are divided into numerous groups of families, and the study of
the many species belonging to each family, is very interesting.

There are thousands of kinds of grasses, shrubs, and trees, scattered
over the different parts of the earth, and the larger portion of them
are in some way useful to mankind.

In speaking of grasses, we are apt to think only of the grass in the
meadows, which is the food for our horses and cattle; but there are
other kinds of grasses which are just as important to man as the grass
of the meadow is to the beast. These are oats, rye, barley, wheat, corn,
and others, all of which belong to the grass family.

Perhaps it appears strange to you to hear wheat and corn called grass,
and you ask how can that be.

In the first place, all plants that have the same general form and
method of growth, belong to the same family.

Now, if you will pull up a stalk of grass and a stalk of wheat or rye
and compare them, you will find that they are alike in all important
respects.

The roots of each look like a little bundle of strings or fibers, and
are therefore called fibrous; the stalks you will find jointed and
hollow; and the leaves are long and narrow, tapering to a point at their
ends.

Then, if you examine the seeds, you will see that they are placed near
together and form what we call an ear or head, as in an ear of corn, or
a head of wheat.

This same general form or structure applies to every one of the plants
belonging to the grass family; and in this family are included all the
different kinds of canes and reeds that grow in swamps and marshy
places, as well as the bamboo of the tropics.

Shrubs are those plants which have woody stems and branches. They are
generally of small size, rarely reaching over twenty feet in height.
Small shrubs are usually called bushes.

In this class of plants, the branches generally start close to the
