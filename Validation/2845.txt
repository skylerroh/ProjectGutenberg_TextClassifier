their drums, they charged the savages.  Some were killed, and, the
rest fleeing, the English burned their wigwams and destroyed their
corn, and carried off their mats and baskets as booty.

But the Pequots were not in the least subdued, and more than ever
they harassed the colonists of Connecticut.  So the men of Connecticut
sent to Massachusetts and to Plymouth asking for help.  The people
of Plymouth, however, said the quarrel was none of theirs and sent
no help, but from Massachusetts about twenty men were sent.  Besides
this, a few friendly Indians, glad at the chance of punishing their
old tyrants, joined with the white men.

So one moonlight night the little company embarked, and, sailing
along the coast, landed at a spot about two days' journey from the
Pequot fort.  As they got near to it most of the Indians who had come
with the English took fright and ran away.  So less than a hundred
Englishmen were left to attack seven hundred Indians.

A little before dawn they reached the fort.  The Indians were
all sleeping and keeping no guard, so the Englishmen quietly took
possession of both entrances to the fort.

Then suddenly through the still morning air the sharp sound of a
volley of musketry rang out "as though the finger of God had touched
both match and flint." Affrighted, the Indians sprang from their
sleep yelling in terror.  They scarce had time to seize their bows
and arrows when, sword in hand, the Englishmen stormed into the
fort.  A fierce fight followed, showers of arrows fell upon the
Englishmen, but they did little hurt, and glanced off for the most
part harmless from their thick buff coats and steel corslets.

During the fight some of the huts were set on fire, and soon the
whole village was a roaring mass of flames.  Many perished miserably
in the fire, others who fled from it were cut down by the Englishmen,
or escaping them, fell into the hands of their own countrymen.  They
found no mercy, for they had given none; and, remembering the awful
tortures which their fellow-countrymen had suffered, the Englishmen
had no compassion on their murderers.

Ere an hour had passed the fight was over.  Out of four hundred
Indians not more than five escaped.  The Pequots were utterly wiped
out and their village a heap of smoking ruins.  Never before had
such terrible vengeance overtaken any Indian tribe.  And all the
other tribes were so frightened and amazed that for forty years
there was peace in New England.  For no Redmen dare attack these
terrible conquerors.

Chapter 30 - The Founding of New Haven




In spite of the menace of the Redmen, Englishmen continued to settle
in the land they claimed.  Even while the Pequot war was going on
a new colony had been founded, still further south upon the shores
of New England.  This colony was founded by a minister named John
Davenport.

John Davenport had fled from persecution in England, and, followed
by his congregation, including many wealthy people, had sought,--like
so many other Puritans,--a refuge in New England.  The newcomers
however, would not join the other Puritans, but decided to found a
colony all to themselves which should be ruled only by laws found
in the Bible.  They called their settlement New Haven, and here
the law that none but church members should vote was very strictly
enforced.

Each of the towns was governed by seven men known as the Pillars of
the Church.  These men served as judges, but no juries were allowed,
because no mention of them is found in the Bible.  The laws were
very strict, but the famous pretended "Blue Laws" of New Haven,
which people used to make fun of, never existed.  In these it was
pretended that there were such absurd laws as, "No one shall cook,
make beds, sweep house, cut hair or shave on the Sabbath.  No woman
shall kiss her child on the Sabbath or fasting day.  No one shall
keep Christmas, make minced pies, dance, play cards or play on any
instrument of music except the drum, trumpet or jew's-harp." Some
of the old Puritan laws seem to us indeed quaint enough, but there
are none quite so absurd as these.  They were invented by an early
"tourist," who sought to make fun of these earnest, God-fearing
colonists.

The New Haven colonists, like those of Connecticut, had no charter
from the King of England.  They settled the land not by agreement
with him, but by agreement with the Indians.

Davenport and his followers bought the land upon which they settled
from the Indians.  To one chief they gave "twelve coats of English
trucking cloth, twelve alchemy spoons, twelve hatchets, twelve hoes,
two dozen of knives, twelve porringers, and four cases of French
knives and scissors." To another, "eleven coats of trucking cloth,
and one coat of English cloth."

The agreement was all duly and properly written out and signed by
the chiefs, but, of course, as the chiefs could not write they made
their marks.  The first agreement was signed not only by the chief
and his council, but also by the chief's sister.

We have now heard of seven New England colonies being founded.
But later on, as we shall see, Plymouth joined with Massachusetts,
and New Haven with Connecticut, thus making only five New England
colonies as we know them today.  And of those five, one (Maine) was
not recognised as a separate colony but as part of Massachusetts
after 1677.  It remained part of Massachusetts until 1820, when it
entered the Union as a state.

Meanwhile Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Plymouth, Connecticut,
and New Haven all joined together, promising to help each other in
case of war with the Indians, Dutch, or French, who were constant
dangers to them all alike.  They called themselves the United Colonies
of New England.  This union, however, was only for defence.  Each
colony was still quite independent of the others and managed its
own affairs as before.  It was only the first shadow of the great
Union which was to come many years later.  It was also one more proof
that the colonies were growing up and thinking for themselves for
they asked no one's leave to form this union.  They thought it was
necessary to their safety, so they entered into it.  Only Rhode
Island was not asked to join; there was still too much bitterness
over religious matters between the settlers there and in the other
colonies.

There were no more Puritan colonies founded, for Puritans ceased
now to come to New England in large numbers.  The reason was that the
great fight between King and People, between Cavalier and Puritan
had begun in old England.  And when the Puritans won, and could have
their own way at home, they were no longer so eager to set forth
to seek a New England beyond the seas.  So the Puritans ceased to
cross the seas, and as we have seen, in their place many Cavaliers
came to Virginia.

Chapter 31 - The Hunt for the Regicides




The Commonwealth of England did not last long.  In 1660 King Charles
II was restored.  England then became an unsafe abode for all those
who had helped to condemn Charles I to death, and two of those men,
General Edward Whalley and William Goffe, fled to America.  They
were kindly received by the Puritans of Boston, and after a time
they moved on to New Haven.  But even in America they were not safe,
and Royalist messengers were sent from England to arrest them, and
take them home to be tried.

The Governor of Massachusetts pretended to be very eager to help
these messengers.  In reality he did nothing to help, but hindered
them, rather.  News of the search for the fugitives soon reached
New Haven, and at once the people there helped them to hide.  For
their minister, John Davenport, had bidden them to "hide the outcasts
and betray not him that wandereth."

Goffe and Whalley knew that the people of New Haven would not betray
them.  But lest their enemies should gain any inkling of their being
there they left the town and, going to another, showed themselves
openly.  Then secretly by night they returned to New Haven.

For a whole month they lay hid there in the cellars of the minister's
house.  But soon that refuge became no longer safe, for the men in
search of them had, in spite of their strategy, traced them to New
Haven and set out to arrest them.

One Saturday the Royalists reached Guilford, not sixteen miles
away.  Here they demanded horses from the Governor to take them on
to New Haven.  But the Governor had little desire to help them.  So
with one excuse after another he put them off until it was too late
to start that night.  The next day was Sunday, and it was strictly
against the laws of Puritan New England to ride or drive on Sunday
save to church.  So the Royalist messengers, chafing with impatience,
might bribe and command as much as they liked; not a man would stir
a hand to help them till Monday morning.

Meanwhile a messenger was speeding on his way to New Haven to warn
the Parliamentarians.  And while their pursuers were kicking their
heels in enforced idleness they slipped away, and found a new hiding
place in a mill some miles off.  But even this was thought not to
be safe, and they fled once more, and at length found refuge in a
cave deep in the forest.

So on Monday when at length the Royalists arrived, the birds had
flown.  The minister owned that they had been there, but declared
that they had vanished away, no man knowing when or whither.

The Royalists scoured the country far and wide in search of the
fugitives.  But their efforts were in vain.  They were very much in
earnest, but they were strangers, and they did not know the country.
No one would help them in their search, and at length, very angry
with the people of New Haven, they gave it up and returned to
Boston.

Then, having spent several months in their cave, the Parliamentarians
crept forth again.  For two years they lived hidden in a friendly
house.  The King, however, was not satisfied, and after two years
messengers again came out from England, and the search was again
begun, more eagerly than before.  Again, however, Goffe and Whalley
were warned, and again they fled to the cave.

Here they lived in safety while the Royalists swept the country
round in search of them.  But they had many narrow escapes.

Once when they had left the shelter of their cave they were almost
caught.  Their pursuers were upon their heels, and to reach the cave
without being taken prisoner seemed impossible.  As the two men fled
before their foes they came to a little river crossed by a wooden
bridge.  It was their last hope.  Instead of crossing the bridge
they crept beneath it, and crouched close to the water.  On came
the pursuers.  They made no pause.  Their horses thundered across
the bridge and galloped away and away, while beneath the fugitives
waited breathlessly.  Then when all was quiet again they crept back
to the shelter of their cave.

But at length the cave became a safe retreat no longer, for it
was discovered by the Indians.  And the fugitives, afraid lest the
Indians, tempted by the large reward offered, might betray their
hiding-place, resolved to seek another.

By this time the fury of the search for them had somewhat abated
and another minister, John Russell, offered them a refuge in his
house.  This minister lived at a place called Hadley.  Hadley was
many miles from New Haven.  It was a lonely settlement on the edge
of the wilderness, and to reach it about a hundred miles of pathless
forest had to be crossed.  But with stout hearts the hunted men
set out.  By day they lay hidden in some friendly house, or in some
lonely cave or other refuge.  By night they journeyed onward.  At
length they reached their new hiding-place.

It was wonderfully contrived.  The minister had lately made some
alterations in his house, and in doing so he had made a safe retreat.
In the attic there was a large cupboard with doors opening into
rooms on either side.  In the floor of the cupboard there was a trap
door which led down into another dark cupboard below, and from
there a passage led to the cellar.  So that, should the house be
searched, any one in the upper rooms could slip into the cupboard,
from there reach the cellar, and thus escape.  Here the regicides
now took up their abode.  And so well was their secret kept that
they lived there for ten or fifteen years, their presence being
unsuspected even by the inhabitants of the little town.

Henceforth the world was dead to them, and they were dead to the world.
They were both soldiers.  On many a field of battle,-Gainsborough,
Marston, Naseby, Worcester, and Dunbar,-they had led their men to
victory.  They had been Members of Parliament, friends of the Great
Protector, and had taken part in all the doings of these stirring
times.

Now all that was over.  Now no command, no power was left to them.
The years went by, dragging their slow length of days, and bringing
no change or brightness to the lives of these two men who lived
in secret and alone.  It was a melancholy life, the monotony only
broken by visits from the minister, or a few other friends, who
brought them all the gossip and news of the town.  These were but
small matters.  But to the two men shut off from all other human
beings they seemed of rare interest.

After ten years Whalley died.  It is believed that he was buried
in the cellar of the house in which for so long he had found a
hiding-place.  Then, for five years or so more, Goffe dragged out
his life alone.

As one might imagine, the King was not at all pleased with
Massachusetts and New Haven for thus sheltering the regicides; and
in 1665 he suppressed New Haven as a separate colony and joined it
to Connecticut.

The New Haven people did not like this at all, and they fought
against it with all their might.  But at length they gave way and
joined Connecticut.

The King was angry with Massachusetts, too, not only for protecting
the regicides, but also because of what is known as the Declaration
of Rights.  In this the people of Massachusetts acknowledged the King
as their ruler.  But they also made it plain that so long as they
did not make laws which ran counter to English laws they expected
to be let alone.  This made King Charles angry, and if it had not
been that he was busy fighting with Holland very likely the people
of Massachusetts would have had to suffer for their boldness at
once.  As it was they were left in peace a little longer.

Chapter 32 - King Philip's War




Meanwhile the people of New England had another foe to fight.

You remember that the Pilgrim Fathers had made a treaty with the
Indians when they first arrived.  As long as the old Chief Massasoit
lived he kept that treaty.  But now he was dead, and his son Philip
ruled.

You will wonder, perhaps, why an Indian chief should have a name
like Philip.  But Philip's real name was Metacomet.  He, however,
wanted to have an English name, and to please him the English called
him Philip.  And by that name he is best known.

For a time all went well.  But very soon Philip and his tribe grew
restless and dissatisfied.  When they saw the white men coming in
always greater and greater numbers, and building towns and villages
further and further into the land, they began to fear them and long
to drive them away.  And at length all their thoughts turned to war.

Friendly Indians and "praying Indians," as those who had become
Christians were called, came now to warn the Pale-faces and tell
them that Philip was gathering his braves, and that he had held a
war dance lasting for several weeks.  In the night, too, people in
lonely farms awoke to hear the wild sound of drums and gun shots.
But still the English hoped to pacify Philip.  So they sent him a
friendly letter telling him to send away his braves, for no white
man wished him ill.

But Philip returned no answer.

Then one Sunday while the people were at church and the houses were
all deserted Indians attacked the little town of Swansea, burning
and plundering.  The next day and the next they returned, tomahawk
and firebrand in hand, and so the war began.

Other tribes joined with King Philip, and soon New England was
filled with terror and bloodshed.  The men of New England gathered
in force to fight the Indians.  But they were a hard foe to fight,
for they never came out to meet the Pale-faces in open field.

At first when the British began to settle in America they had made
it a rule never to sell firearms to the Indians.  But that rule had
long ago been broken through.  Now the Indians not only had guns,
but many of them were as good shots as the British.  Yet they kept
to their old ways of fighting, and, stealthily as wild animals, they
skulked behind trees, or lurked in the long grass, seeking their
enemies.  They knew all the secret forest ways, they were swift of
foot, untiring, and mad with the lust of blood.  So from one lonely
village to another they sped swiftly a the eagle, secretly as the
fox.  And where they passed they left a trail of blood and ashes.

At night around some lonely homestead all would seem quiet.  Far as
the eye could see there would be no slightest sign of any Redman,
and the tired labourer would go to rest feeling safe, with his
wife and children beside him.  But ere the first red streaks of dawn
shivered across the sky he would be awakened by fiendish yells.
Ere he could seize his gun the savages would be upon him.  And the
sun when it rose would show only blackened, blood-stained ruins
where but a few hours before a happy home had been.

Yet with this red terror on every side the people went on quietly
with their daily life.  On week days they tilled their fields and
minded their herds, on Sundays they went, as usual, to church,
leaving their homes deserted.  But even to church they went armed,
and while they knelt in prayer or listened to the words of their
pastor their guns were ever within reach of their hands.

One Sunday, while in the village of Hadley the people were all
at church, the Indians crept up in their usual stealthy fashion.
Suddenly the alarm was given, and, seizing their guns which stood
by their sides, the men rushed out of the meeting-house.  But they
were all in confusion: the attack was sudden, they were none of
them soldiers, but merely brave men ready to die for their homes
and their dear ones, and they had and they had no leader.

Then suddenly a stranger appeared amongst them.  He was dressed
in quaint old-fashioned clothes.  His hair and beard were long and
streaked with grey.  He was tall and soldierly, and his eyes shone
with the joy of battle.

At once he took command.  Sharply his orders rang out.  Unquestioningly
the villagers obeyed, for he spoke as one used to command.  They were
no longer an armed crowd, but a company of soldiers, and, fired by
the courage and skill of their leader, they soon put the Indians
to flight.

When the fight was over the men turned to thank their deliverer.
But he was nowhere to be found.  He had vanished as quickly and
mysteriously as he had come.

"What did it mean?" they asked. "Who was the strange leader? Had
God in His mercy sent an angel from heaven to their rescue ?"

No one could answer their questions, and many decided that indeed
a miracle had happened, and that God had sent an angel to deliver
them.

This strange leader was no other than the regicide, Colonel Goffe,
who, as we know, had for many years lived hidden in the minister's
house.  From his attic window he had seen the Indians creeping
stealthily upon the village.  And when he saw the people standing
leaderless and bewildered, he had been seized with his old fighting
spirit, and had rushed forth to lead them.  Then, the danger being
over, he had slipped quietly back to his hiding-place.  There he
remained hidden from all the world as before, until he died and
was buried beside his friend.

Autumn passed and winter came, and the Indians gathered to their
forts, for the bare forests gave too little protection to them in
their kind of warfare.  When spring came they promised themselves
to come forth again and make an end of the Pale-faces.  But the
Pale-faces did not wait for spring.

The Indians had gathered to the number of over three thousand
into a strong fortress.  It was surrounded by a marsh and the only
entrance was over a bridge made by a fallen tree.

This fortress the New Englanders decided to attack and take.  So,
a thousand strong, they set out one morning before dawn and, after
hours of weary marching through the snow, they reached the fort.
Across the narrow bridge they rushed, and although many of their
leaders fell dead, the men came on, nothing daunted.  A fierce fight
followed, for each side knew that they must win or die.  Shut in on
all sides by impassable swamps there was no escape.  But not till
dark was falling did the white men gain the victory.  The ground
was strewn with dead and dying, and in the gathering darkness the
remaining Indians stole quietly away, and vanished like shadows.
Then the New Englanders set fire to the wigwams, and, taking their
wounded, marched back to their headquarters.

This was a sad blow to the Indians, but it did not by any means end
the war which, as spring came on, broke out again in full fury.  But
gradually the white men got the upper hand.  Instead of attacking,
the Redmen fled before them.  They lost heart and began to blame King
Philip for having led them into war, and at length he was slain by
one of his own followers.

Soon after this the war came to an end.  But whole tracts of New
England were a desert, a thousand of the bravest and best of the
young men were killed.  Many women and children, too, had been slain,
and there was hardly a fireside in the whole of Massachusetts where
there was not a vacant place.  Numbers of people were utterly ruined
and the colonies were burdened with a great debt.

As to the Indians their power was utterly broken, and their tribes
were almost wiped out.  Except the Mohegans, who had remained
friendly throughout the war, there were few Indians left in south
New England, where there was never again a war between white men
and Indians.

Chapter 33 - How The Charter of Connecticut Was Saved




Meanwhile King Charles had not forgotten his anger against the
people of Massachusetts.  Besides the fact that they had harboured
the regicides, he had many other reasons for being angry with them.
For they refused to obey the Navigation Laws, and they refused to
allow the Church of England to be established within the colony.
They had coined money of their own, never made their officials
swear allegiance to the throne, and had done many things just as
they liked.

In fact Massachusetts seemed to Charles like a badly brought-up
child, who, having come to manhood, wants to go his own way and
cares nothing for the wishes or commands of his parents.  He made
up his mind not to have any more of this disobedience, and he took
away the charter and made Massachusetts a Crown Colony.  Thus after
fifty-five years of practical freedom Massachusetts once more
belonged to the King of England, by right of the discovery of John
and Sebastian Cabot.  Of course, the people of Massachusetts fought
against this as hard as they could, but their struggle was useless,
and a royal Governor was appointed to rule the colony.

Almost immediately, however, Charles died, and it was not until his
brother, James II, was on the throne that Sir Edmund Andros came
out as royal Governor.  He came not only as Governor of Massachusetts
but as Governor of all the New England Colonies.  For the King wanted
to make an end of all these separate colonies and unite them into
one great province.

Andros soon made himself very much disliked, for he tried to rule
New England too much as his master tried to rule Great Britain.  He
levied taxes as he pleased, he imprisoned innocent men if he chose,
he allowed nothing to be printed without his permission, he seized
lands and goods at will.

All New England felt the weight of the Governor's hand.  He demanded
Rhode Island's charter.  But the Governor of Rhode Island replied
that the weather was so bad he really could not send it.  So Sir
Edmund went to Rhode Island, dissolved its government and smashed
its seal.

To Connecticut also Sir Edmund wrote in vain, demanding its charter.
The men of Connecticut were, it seemed to him, an unruly lot.  So
one October day in 1687 he set out to visit this rebellious state
and subdue it to his will.

He arrived in Hartford with a great train of gentlemen and soldiers.
They made a mighty stir in the little town as they rode, jingling
and clanking through the quiet streets, and drew rein before the
state house.  Into the chamber where the Council sat strode Andros
looking pompous and grand in lace, and velvet, and a great flowing
wig.  Up to the table he strode, and in tones of haughty command,
demanded the charter.

But the men of Connecticut would not lightly give up the sign of
their beloved liberty.  They talked and argued and persuaded.  They
spoke of the hardships they had endured, of the blood they had
poured forth to keep their freedom in their new found homes, upon
the edge of the wilderness.

But with such a man as Andros all appeals, all persuasions were in
vain.  To every argument he had but one answer,-he must and would
have the charter.

Long and long the argument lasted.  The day drew to a close and
twilight fell.  Through the dusky gloom men could hardly see each
other's flushed, excited faces.  Lights were called for, and candles
were brought.  Some were placed upon the table beside the metal box
in which lay the charter.  Still the debate went on, either side as
unbending as before.  Now many citizens, anxious to know how things
went, slipped into the room and stood behind the members, listening
as the debate was flung this way and that.  Outside the night was
dark, within the woodpanelled room the flickering candles shed but
a dim, uncertain light.

They made strange dancing shadows, shining fitfully on the stern,
eager faces of the men who sat round the table, but scarcely
revealing against the gloom the crowd of anxious citizens behind.

Sir Edmund was weary of the talk.  He would have no more of it, and,
suddenly rising, he stretched out his hand to seize the charter.
Then, swiftly from out the shadowy circle of listeners, a cloak was
flung upon the table.  It fell upon the candles and put them out.
In a moment the room was in total darkness.

There was an outcry and a scuffling of feet, the sound of an opening
window, a call for lights.  But lights were no such speedy matters
in those days when matches had not been invented.  When at length
the scratching of the tinder boxes was done and the candles relit,
every one looked eagerly at the table.  Behold, the charter was
gone!

Sir Edmund stormed, and citizens and councilors looked blankly at
each other.  But meanwhile through the darkness a man sped.  In his
hand he held a parchment, and he never halted in his run till he
reached a great oak tree.  This oak he knew was hollow.  Reaching it
he thrust the parchment deep into the hole and carefully covered it
up with dried leaves and bark.  Thus was the charter of Connecticut
saved.

The man who saved it was Captain Wadsworth.  Ever afterwards the
tree was called the Charter Oak, and until about sixty years ago
it stood a memorial of his deed.  But some wise folk say this story
of the Charter Oak is all a fairy tale.  That may be so.  But it
deserves to be true.

Yet though the men of Connecticut may have succeeded in saving the
sign and symbol of their freedom, they could not save the reality.
For whether Sir Edmund Andros was in possession of their charter
or not he stamped upon their liberties just the same.  In the public
record the secretary wrote: "His Excellency Sir Edmund Andros,
Knight Captain General and Governor of His Majesty's Territory and
Dominion in New England, by order from his Majesty, King of England,
Scotland and Ireland, the 31st of October, 1687, took into his
hands the government of this Colony, of Connecticut, it being by
his Majesty annexed to the Massachusetts and other Colonies under
his Excellency's Government.

"Finis."

"Finis, " as you know, means "the end." And one cannot but feel
sorry for that stern, old, freedom loving Puritan gentleman who
wrote the words.  For indeed to him the loss of freedom must have
seemed the end of all things.

Sir Edmund's rule, however, did not last long.  For the British
soon grew tired of James II and his tyrannous ways, and they asked
Prince William of Orange to come and be their King.  William came,
the people received him with delight, King James fled away to France,
and the "glorious Revolution," as it was called, was accomplished.

When the news reached New England there, too, was a little revolution.
One spring morning there was a great commotion among the people of
Boston.  There was beating of drums, noise and shouting, and much
running to and fro of young men carrying clubs.  Soon it was seen that
the city was in arms.  The men marched to the castle, and demanded
its surrender.  And Andros, knowing himself to be helpless, yielded,
though not without some "stomachful reluctances." The proud
Governor's rule was at an end.  He was taken prisoner, and through
the streets where he had ridden in splendour he was now led a
captive.  Then the colonies set about restoring their governments
as they had been before Sir Edmund Andros came.

But Andros had no mind to remain a prisoner.  He and his friends
who were imprisoned with him had a good deal of freedom.  They were
locked into their rooms at night, but during the day they were
allowed to walk about anywhere within sight of the sentries, and
their friends were allowed to come to see them quite freely.  It
would not be difficult to escape, thought Andros, and he resolved
to do it.  So he bribed one of his jailers, and, having procured
woman's clothes, he dressed himself in them and calmly walked out
of his prison.

He passed two sentries safely.  But the third looked sharply at the
tall woman who strode along so manfully.  He looked at her boots.  At
once the sentry's suspicions were aroused; for Sir Edmund had not
thought of changing them.  No woman ever wore such boots as these,
thought the sentry, and he challenged and stopped her.  Then, peering
beneath the rim of her bonnet, he saw no bashful woman's face, but
the well-known features of the Governor.

So back to prison Andros went.  After this he was not allowed so
much freedom.  But again he tried to escape, and this time he was
more successful.  He got not only out of Boston, but out of the
colony.  Once more, however, he was recognised and brought back.

The whole of New England had been agog with excitement, but at
length things began to calm down, and "the world moved on in its
old orderly pace," says a writer of the times.

In the midst of this calm two ships arrived from England with an
order to those in power to proclaim William and Mary King and Queen.
Then the colonies went mad with joy.  From far and near the people
flocked to Boston.  Bells were rung, bonfires blazed, and after
a great procession through the streets there was feasting at the
Townhall.  Thus "with joy, splendour, appearance and unanimity, as
had never before been seen in these territories," were William and
Mary proclaimed.

Sir Edmund Andros was now sent home to England a prisoner.  But King
William was not altogether pleased with all the colonists had done,
and he was set free without any trial.  He was not really a bad man,
but he was dogged and pig-headed, without sympathy or imagination,
and altogether the wrong man in the wrong place.  Later on he came
back to America as Governor of Virginia, and this time he did much
better.

Meanwhile several changes were made in New England.  Rhode Island
and Connecticut kept their old charters, to which they had clung
so lovingly.  New Hampshire, too, remained a separate colony.  But
Plymouth, sad to say, that gallant little colony founded by the Pilgrim
Fathers lost separate existence and became part of Massachusetts.
Maine and even Nova Scotia, lately won from the French, were for
the meantime also joined to Massachusetts.

Massachusetts was now a great colony and received a new charter.
But things were not the same.  The colony was now a royal province,
and the Governor was no longer appointed by the people, but by the
King.  This chafed the people greatly, for they felt that their old
freedom was gone.  So for a time the history of Massachusetts was
hardly more than a dreary chronicle of quarrels and misunderstandings
between Governor and people.

Chapter 34 - The Witches of Salem




We have all read stories about witches, but we do not really believe
in them.  They are exciting enough to read about, but we know they
are merely bad-fairy sort of folk who are only to be met with in
books, and not in real life.  We should be very much astonished, and
rather frightened perhaps, if we thought that witches were real,
and that we might some day meet one.

But in those far-off days more than two hundred years ago very
many people believed in witches.  Although not always so, it was
generally very old people, people who had grown ugly and witless
with age who were accused of being witches.  In almost any village
might be seen poor old creatures, toothless, hollow cheeked,
wrinkled, with nose and chin almost meeting.  Bent almost double,
they walked about with a crutch, shaking and mumbling as they went.
