endeavoured to prevent his making his way to the apartment where
his children slept, and exclaiming furiously--"Rejoice, my
treasures--rejoice!--He has fled, who would proclaim your father's
crime, and your mother's dishonour!--He has fled, never to return,
whose life has been the death of one parent, and the ruin of
another!--Courage, my children, your father is with you--he will make
his way to you through a hundred obstacles!"

The domestics, intimidated and undecided, were giving way to him, when
Adam Hartley approached, and placing himself before the unhappy man,
fixed his eye firmly on the General's, while he said in a low but stern
voice--"Madman, would you kill your children?"

The General seemed staggered in his resolution, but still attempted to
rush past him. But Hartley, seizing him by the collar of his coat on
each side, "You are my prisoner," he said; "I command you to follow me."

"Ha! prisoner, and for high treason? Dog, thou hast met thy death!"

The distracted man drew a poniard from his bosom, and Hartley's strength
and resolution might not perhaps have saved his life, had not Winter
mastered the General's right hand, and contrived to disarm him.

"I am your prisoner, then," he said; "use me civilly--and let me see my
wife and children."

"You shall see them to-morrow," said Hartley; "follow us instantly, and
without the least resistance."

General Witherington followed like a child, with the air of one who is
suffering for a cause in which he glories.

"I am not ashamed of my principles," he said--"I am willing to die for
my king."

Without exciting his frenzy, by contradicting the fantastic idea which
occupied his imagination, Hartley continued to maintain over his
patient the ascendency he had acquired. He caused him to be led to his
apartment, and beheld him suffer himself to be put to bed. Administering
then a strong composing draught, and causing a servant to sleep in the
room, he watched the unfortunate man till dawn of morning.

General Witherington awoke in his full senses, and apparently conscious
of his real situation, which he testified by low groans, sobs, and
tears. When Hartley drew near his bedside, he knew him perfectly, and
said, "Do not fear me--the fit is over--leave me now, and see after
yonder unfortunate. Let him leave Britain as soon as possible, and go
where his fate calls him, and where we can never meet more. Winter knows
my ways, and will take care of me."

Winter gave the same advice. "I can answer," he said, "for my master's
security at present; but in Heaven's name, prevent his ever meeting
again, with that obdurate young man!"




CHAPTER THE NINTH.


  "Well, then, the world's mine oyster,
    Which I with sword will open.
                MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR.

When Adam Hartley arrived at his lodgings in the sweet little town of
Ryde, his first enquiries were after his comrade. He had arrived
last night late, man and horse all in a foam. He made no reply to any
questions about supper or the like, but snatching a candle, ran up
stairs into his apartment, and shut and double-locked the door. The
servants only supposed, that, being something intoxicated, he had ridden
hard, and was unwilling to expose himself.

Hartley went to the door of his chamber, not without some apprehensions;
and after knocking and calling more than once, received at length the
welcome return, "Who is there?"

On Hartley announcing himself, the door opened, and Middlemas appeared,
well dressed, and with his hair arranged and powdered; although, from
the appearance of the bed, it had not been slept in on the preceding
night, and Richard's countenance, haggard and ghastly, seemed to bear
witness to the same fact. It was, however, with an affectation of
indifference that he spoke.

"I congratulate you on your improvement in worldly knowledge, Adam. It
is just the time to desert the poor heir, and to stick by him that is in
immediate possession of the wealth."

"I staid last night at General Witherington's," answered Hartley,
"because he is extremely ill."

"Tell him to repent of his sins, then," said Richard. "Old Gray used to
say, a doctor had as good a title to give ghostly advice as a parson. Do
you remember Doctor Dulberry, the minister, calling him an interloper?
Ha! Ha! Ha!"

"I am surprised at this style of language from one in your
circumstances."

"Why, ay," said Middlemas, with a bitter smile--"it would be difficult
to most men to keep up their spirits, after gaining and losing father,
mother, and a good inheritance, all in the same day. But I had always a
turn for philosophy."

"I really do not understand you, Mr. Middlemas."

"Why, I found my parents yesterday, did I not?" answered the young
man. "My mother, as you know, had waited but that moment to die, and
my father to become distracted; and I conclude both were contrived
purposely to cheat me of my inheritance, as he has taken up such a
prejudice against me."

"Inheritance?" repeated Hartley, bewildered by Richard's calmness, and
half suspecting that the insanity of the father was hereditary in the
family. "In Heaven's name, recollect yourself, and get rid of these
hallucinations. What inheritance are you dreaming of?"

"That of my mother, to be sure, who must have inherited old Moncada's
wealth--and to whom should it descend, save to her children?--I am the
eldest of them--that fact cannot be denied."

"But consider, Richard--recollect yourself."

"I do," said Richard; "and what then?"

"Then you cannot but remember," said Hartley, "that unless there was a
will in your favour, your birth prevents you from inheriting."

"You are mistaken, sir, I am legitimate.--Yonder sickly brats, whom you
rescued from the grave, are not more legitimate than I am.--Yes! our
parents could not allow the air of Heaven to breathe on them--me they
committed to the winds and the waves--I am nevertheless their lawful
child, as well as their puling offspring of advanced age and decayed
health. I saw them, Adam--Winter showed the nursery to me while they
were gathering courage to receive me in the drawing-room. There they
lay, the children of predilection, the riches of the East expended
that they might sleep soft and wake in magnificence. I, the eldest
brother--the heir--I stood beside their bed in the borrowed dress which
I had so lately exchanged for the rags of an hospital. Their couches
breathed the richest perfumes, while I was reeking from a pest-house;
and I--I repeat it--the heir, the produce of their earliest and best
love, was thus treated. No wonder that my look was that of a basilisk."

"You speak as if you were possessed with an evil spirit," said Hartley;
"or else you labour under a strange delusion."

"You think those only are legally married over whom a drowsy parson has
read the ceremony from a dog's-eared prayer-book? It may be so in your
English law--but Scotland makes Love himself the priest. A vow betwixt a
fond couple, the blue heaven alone witnessing, will protect a confiding
girl against the perjury of a fickle swain, as much as if a Dean had
performed the rites in the loftiest cathedral in England. Nay, more; if
the child of love be acknowledged by the father at the time when he is
baptized--if he present the mother to strangers of respectability as
his wife, the laws of Scotland will not allow him to retract the
justice which has, in these actions, been done to the female whom he has
wronged, or the offspring of their mutual love. This General Tresham,
or Witherington, treated my unhappy mother as his wife before Gray and
others, quartered her as such in the family of a respectable man, gave
her the same name by which he himself chose to pass for the time. He
presented me to the priest as his lawful offspring; and the law of
Scotland, benevolent to the helpless child, will not allow him now to
disown what he so formally admitted. I know my rights, and am determined
to claim them."

"You do not then intend to go on board the Middlesex? Think a
little--You will lose your voyage and your commission."

"I will save my birth-right," answered Middlemas. "When I thought of
going to India, I knew not my parents, or how to make good the rights
which I had through them. That riddle is solved. I am entitled to
at least a third of Moncada's estate, which, by Winter's account, is
considerable. But for you, and your mode of treating the small-pox, I
should have had the whole. Little did I think, when old Gray was
likely to have his wig pulled off, for putting out fires, throwing open
windows, and exploding whisky and water, that the new system of treating
the small-pox was to cost me so many thousand pounds."

"You are determined then," said Hartley, "on this wild course?"

"I know my rights, and am determined to make them available," answered
the obstinate youth.

"Mr. Richard Middlemas, I am sorry for you."

"Mr. Adam Hartley, I beg to know why I am honoured by your sorrow."

"I pity you," answered Hartley, "both for the obstinacy of selfishness,
which can think of wealth after the scene you saw last night, and
for the idle vision which leads you to believe that you can obtain
possession of it."

"Selfish!" cried Middlemas; "why, I am a dutiful son, labouring to clear
the memory of a calumniated mother--And am I a visionary?--Why, it
was to this hope that I awakened, when old Moncada's letter to Gray,
devoting me to perpetual obscurity, first roused me to a sense of my
situation, and dispelled the dreams of my childhood. Do you think that
I would ever have submitted to the drudgery which I shared with you,
but that, by doing so, I kept in view the only traces of these unnatural
parents, by means of which I proposed to introduce myself to their
notice, and, if necessary, enforce the rights of a legitimate child?
The silence and death of Moncada broke my plans, and it was then only I
reconciled myself to the thoughts of India."

"You were very young to have known so much of the Scottish law, at the
time when we were first acquainted," said Hartley. "But I can guess your
instructor."

"No less authority than Tom Hillary's," replied Middlemas. "His good
counsel on that head is a reason why I do not now prosecute him to the
gallows."

"I judged as much," replied Hartley; "for I heard him, before I
left Middlemas, debating the point with Mr. Lawford; and I recollect
perfectly, that he stated the law to be such as you now lay down."

"And what said Lawford in answer?" demanded Middlemas.

"He admitted," replied Hartley, "that in circumstances where the case
was doubtful, such presumptions of legitimacy might be admitted. But
he said they were liable to be controlled by positive and precise
testimony, as, for instance, the evidence of the mother declaring the
illegitimacy of the child."

"But there can exist none such in my case," said Middlemas hastily, and
with marks of alarm.

"I will not deceive you, Mr. Middlemas, though I fear I cannot help
giving you pain. I had yesterday a long conference with your mother,
Mrs. Witherington, in which she acknowledged you as her son, but a son
born before marriage. This express declaration will, therefore, put an
end to the suppositions on which you ground your hopes. If you please,
you may hear the contents of her declaration, which I have in her own
handwriting."

"Confusion! is the cup to be for ever dashed from my lips?" muttered
Richard; but recovering his composure, by exertion of the self-command,
of which he possessed so large a portion, he desired Hartley to proceed
with his communication. Hartley accordingly proceeded to inform him of
the particulars preceding his birth, and those which followed after
it; while Middlemas, seated on a sea-chest, listened with inimitable
composure to a tale which went to root up the flourishing hopes of
wealth which he had lately so fondly entertained.

Zilia Moncada was the only child of a Portuguese Jew of great wealth,
who had come to London, in prosecution of his commerce. Among the few
Christians who frequented his house, and occasionally his table, was
Richard Tresham, a gentleman of a high Northumbrian family, deeply
engaged in the service of Charles Edward during his short invasion, and
though holding a commission in the Portuguese service, still an object
of suspicion to the British government, on account of his well-known
courage and Jacobitical principles. The high-bred elegance of this
gentleman, together with his complete acquaintance with the Portuguese
language and manners, had won the intimacy of old Moncada, and, alas!
the heart of the inexperienced Zilia, who, beautiful as an angel, had
as little knowledge of the world and it's wickedness as the lamb that is
but a week old.

Tresham made his proposals to Moncada, perhaps in a manner which too
evidently showed that he conceived the high-born Christian was degrading
himself in asking an alliance with the wealthy Jew. Moncada rejected his
proposals, forbade him his house, but could not prevent the lovers
from meeting in private. Tresham made a dishonourable use of the
opportunities which the poor Zilia so incautiously afforded, and the
consequence was her ruin. The lover, however, had every purpose of
righting the injury which he had inflicted, and, after various plans
of secret marriage, which were rendered abortive by the difference of
religion, and other circumstances, flight for Scotland was determined
on. The hurry of the journey, the fear and anxiety to which Zilia was
subjected, brought on her confinement several weeks before the usual
time, so that they were compelled to accept of the assistance and
accommodation offered by Mr. Gray. They had not been there many hours
ere Tresham heard, by the medium of some sharp-sighted or keen-eared
friend, that there were warrants out against him for treasonable
practices. His correspondence with Charles Edward had become known
to Moncada during the period of their friendship; he betrayed it in
vengeance to the British cabinet, and warrants were issued, in which,
at Moncada's request, his daughter's name was included. This might be
of use, he apprehended, to enable him to separate his daughter from
Tresham, should he find the fugitives actually married. How far he
succeeded, the reader already knows, as well as the precautions which
he took to prevent the living evidence of his child's frailty from being
known to exist. His daughter he carried with him, and subjected her to
severe restraint, which her own reflections rendered doubly bitter. It
would have completed his revenge, had the author of Zilia's misfortunes
been brought to the scaffold for his political offences. But Tresham
skulked among his friends in the Highlands, and escaped until the affair
blew over.

He afterwards entered into the East India Company's service, under his
mother's name of Witherington, which concealed the Jacobite and rebel,
until these terms were forgotten. His skill in military affairs soon
raised him to riches and eminence. When he returned to Britain, his
first enquiries were after the family of Moncada. His fame, his wealth,
and the late conviction that his daughter never would marry any but him
who had her first love, induced the old man to give that encouragement
to General Witherington, which he had always denied to the poor and
outlawed Major Tresham; and the lovers, after having been fourteen years
separated, were at length united in wedlock.

General Witherington eagerly concurred in the earnest wish of his
father-in-law, that every remembrance of former events should be buried,
by leaving the fruit of the early and unhappy intrigue suitably
provided for, but in a distant and obscure situation. Zilia thought far
otherwise. Her heart longed, with a mother's longing, towards the object
of her first maternal tenderness, but she dared not place herself in
opposition at once to the will of her father, and the decision of her
husband. The former, his religious prejudices much effaced by his long
residence in England, had given consent that she should conform to
the established religion of her husband and her country,--the latter,
haughty as we have described him, made it his pride to introduce the
beautiful convert among his high-born kindred. The discovery of her
former frailty would have proved a blow to her respectability, which he
dreaded like death; and it could not long remain a secret from his wife,
that in consequence of a severe illness in India, even his reason became
occasionally shaken by anything which violently agitated his feelings.
She had, therefore, acquiesced in patience and silence in the course of
policy which Moncada had devised, and which her husband anxiously and
warmly approved. Yet her thoughts, even when their marriage was blessed
with other offspring, anxiously reverted to the banished and outcast
child, who had first been clasped to the maternal bosom.

All these feelings, "subdued and cherished long," were set afloat in
full tide by the unexpected discovery of this son, redeemed from a
lot of extreme misery, and placed before his mother's imagination in
circumstances so disastrous.

It was in vain that her husband had assured her that he would secure the
young man's prosperity, by his purse and his interest. She could not be
satisfied, until she had herself done something to alleviate the doom of
banishment to which her eldest-born was thus condemned. She was the more
eager to do so, as she felt the extreme delicacy of her health, which
was undermined by so many years of secret suffering.

Mrs. Witherington was, in conferring her maternal bounty, naturally led
to employ the agency of Hartley, the companion of her son, and to whom,
since the recovery of her younger children, she almost looked up as to a
tutelar deity. She placed in his hands a sum of L2000, which she had at
her own unchallenged disposal, with a request, uttered in the fondest
and most affectionate terms, that it might be applied to the service of
Richard Middlemas in the way Hartley should think most useful to him.
She assured him of further support, as it should be needed; and a note
to the following purport was also intrusted him, to be delivered when
and where the prudence of Hartley should judge it proper to confide to
him the secret of his birth.

"Oh, Benoni! Oh, child of my sorrow!" said this interesting document,
"why should the eyes of thy unhappy mother be about to obtain permission
to look on thee, since her arms were denied the right to fold thee to
her bosom? May the God of Jews and of Gentiles watch over thee, and
guard thee! May he remove, in his good time, the darkness which rolls
between me and the beloved of my heart--the first fruit of my unhappy,
nay, unhallowed affection. Do not--do not, my beloved!--think thyself a
lonely exile, while thy mother's prayers arise for thee at sunrise and
at sunset, to call down every blessing on thy head--to invoke every
power in thy protection and defence. Seek not to see me--Oh, why must I
say so!--But let me humble myself in the dust, since it is my own sin,
my own folly, which I must blame!--but seek not to see or speak with
me--it might be the death of both. Confide thy thoughts to the excellent
Hartley, who hath been the guardian angel of us all--even as the tribes
of Israel had each their guardian angel. What thou shalt wish, and
he shall advise in thy behalf, shall be done, if in the power of a
mother--And the love of a mother! Is it bounded by seas, or can deserts
and distance measure its limits? Oh, child of my sorrow! Oh, Benoni! let
thy spirit be with mine, as mine is with thee." Z. M.

All these arrangements being completed, the unfortunate lady next
insisted with her husband that she should be permitted to see her son in
that parting interview which terminated so fatally. Hartley, therefore,
now discharged as her executor, the duty intrusted to him as her
confidential agent.
