A KNIGHT OF THE WHITE CROSS


By G.A. Henty




PREFACE.


MY DEAR LADS,

The order of the Knights of St. John, which for some centuries played
a very important part in the great struggle between Christianity and
Mahomedanism, was, at its origin, a semi-religious body, its members
being, like other monks, bound by vows of obedience, chastity, and
poverty, and pledged to minister to the wants of the pilgrims who
flocked to the Holy Places, to receive them at their great Hospital--or
guest house--at Jerusalem, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, and to
defend them on their passage to and from the sea, against attack by
Moslems. In a comparatively short time the constitution of the order was
changed, and the Knights Hospitallers became, like the Templars, a
great military Order pledged to defend the Holy Sepulchre, and to war
everywhere against the Moslems. The Hospitallers bore a leading share
in the struggle which terminated in the triumph of the Moslems, and the
capture by them of Jerusalem. The Knights of St. John then established
themselves at Acre, but after a valiant defence of that fortress,
removed to Crete, and shortly afterwards to Rhodes. There they fortified
the town, and withstood two terrible sieges by the Turks. At the end
of the second they obtained honourable terms from Sultan Solyman, and
retiring to Malta established themselves there in an even stronger
fortress than that of Rhodes, and repulsed all the efforts of the Turks
to dispossess them. The Order was the great bulwark of Christendom
against the invasion of the Turks, and the tale of their long struggle
is one of absorbing interest, and of the many eventful episodes none
is more full of incident and excitement than the first siege of Rhodes,
which I have chosen for the subject of my story.

Yours truly, G. A. Henty




CHAPTER I The King Maker


A stately lady was looking out of the window of an apartment in the
Royal Chateau of Amboise, in the month of June, 1470. She was still
handsome, though many years of anxiety, misfortune, and trouble, had
left their traces on her face. In the room behind her, a knight was
talking to a lady sitting at a tambour frame; a lad of seventeen was
standing at another window stroking a hawk that sat on his wrist,
while a boy of nine was seated at a table examining the pages of an
illuminated missal.

"What will come of it, Eleanor?" the lady at the window said, turning
suddenly and impatiently from it. "It seems past belief that I am to
meet as a friend this haughty earl, who has for fifteen years been the
bitterest enemy of my House. It appears almost impossible."

"'Tis strange indeed, my Queen; but so many strange things have befallen
your Majesty that you should be the last to wonder at this. At any rate,
as you said but yesterday, naught but good can come of it. He has done
his worst against you, and one can scarce doubt that if he chooses he
has power to do as much good for you, as in past times he has done you
evil. 'Tis certain that his coming here shows he is in earnest, for
his presence,--which is sure sooner or later to come to the ears of the
Usurper,--will cause him to fall into the deepest disgrace."

"And yet it seemed," the queen said, "that by marrying his daughter
to Clarence he had bound himself more firmly than ever to the side of
York."

"Ay, madam," the knight said. "But Clarence himself is said to be alike
unprincipled and ambitious, and it may well be that Warwick intended to
set him up against Edward; had he not done so, such an alliance would
not necessarily strengthen his position at Court."

"Methinks your supposition is the true one, Sir Thomas," the queen said.
"Edward cares not sufficiently for his brother to bestow much favour
upon the father of the prince's wife. Thus, he would gain but little
by the marriage unless he were to place Clarence on the throne. Then
he would again become the real ruler of England, as he was until Edward
married Elizabeth Woodville, and the House of Rivers rose to the first
place in the royal favour, and eclipsed the Star of Warwick. It is no
wonder the proud Earl chafes under the ingratitude of the man who owes
his throne to him, and that he is ready to dare everything so that he
can but prove to him that he is not to be slighted with impunity. But
why come to me, when he has Clarence as his puppet?"

"He may have convinced himself, madam, that Clarence is even less to
be trusted than Edward, or he may perceive that but few of the Yorkists
would follow him were he to declare against the Usurper, while assuredly
your adherents would stand aloof altogether from such a struggle.
Powerful as he is, Warwick could not alone withstand the united forces
of all the nobles pledged to the support of the House of York. Thence,
as I take it, does it happen that he has resolved to throw in his lot
with Lancaster, if your Majesty will but forgive the evil he has done
your House and accept him as your ally. No doubt he will have terms to
make and conditions to lay down."

"He may make what conditions he chooses," Queen Margaret said
passionately, "so that he does but aid me to take vengeance on that
false traitor; to place my husband again on the throne; and to obtain
for my son his rightful heritage."

As she spoke a trumpet sounded in the courtyard below.

"He has come," she exclaimed. "Once again, after years of misery and
humiliation, I can hope."

"We had best retire, madam," Sir Thomas Tresham said. "He will speak
more freely to your Majesty if there are no witnesses. Come, Gervaise,
it is time that you practised your exercises." And Sir Thomas, with his
wife and child, quitted the room, leaving Queen Margaret with her son to
meet the man who had been the bitterest foe of her House, the author of
her direst misfortunes.

For two hours the Earl of Warwick was closeted with the queen; then he
took horse and rode away. As soon as he did so, a servant informed Sir
Thomas and his wife that the queen desired their presence. Margaret was
standing radiant when they entered.

"Congratulate me, my friends," she said. "The Star of Lancaster has
risen again. Warwick has placed all his power and influence at our
disposal. We have both forgiven all the past: I the countless injuries
he has inflicted on my House, he the execution of his father and so many
of his friends. We have both laid aside all our grievances, and we stand
united by our hate for Edward. There is but one condition, and this I
accepted gladly--namely, that my son should marry his daughter Anne.
This will be another bond between us; and by all reports Anne is a
charming young lady. Edward has gladly agreed to the match; he could
make no alliance, even with the proudest princess in Europe, which would
so aid him, and so strengthen his throne."

"God grant that your hopes may be fulfilled, madam," the knight said
earnestly, "and that peace may be given to our distracted country! The
Usurper has rendered himself unpopular by his extravagance and by the
exactions of his tax collectors, and I believe that England will gladly
welcome the return of its lawful king to power. When does Warwick
propose to begin?"

"He will at once get a fleet together. Louis, who has privately brought
about this meeting, will of course throw no impediment in his way; but,
on the other hand, the Duke of Burgundy will do all in his power to
thwart the enterprise, and will, as soon as he learns of it, warn
Edward. I feel new life in me, Eleanor. After fretting powerless for
years, I seem to be a different woman now that there is a prospect of
action. I am rejoiced at the thought that at last I shall be able to
reward those who have ventured and suffered so much in the cause of
Lancaster."

"My hope is, madam, that this enterprise will be the final one,--that,
once successful, our dear land will be no longer deluged with blood,
and that never again shall I be forced to draw my sword against my
countrymen."

"'Tis a good and pious wish, Sir Thomas, and heartily do I join in it.
My married life has been one long round of trouble, and none more than I
have cause to wish for peace."

"There is the more hope for it, madam, that these wars have greatly
diminished the number of powerful barons. It is they who are the authors
of this struggle; their rivalries and their ambitions are the ruin of
England. Save for their retainers there would be no armies to place in
the field; the mass of people stand aloof altogether, desiring only to
live in peace and quiet. 'Tis the same here in France; 'tis the powerful
vassals of the king that are ever causing trouble."

"'Tis so indeed, Sir Thomas. But without his feudal lords how could a
king place an army in the field, when his dominions were threatened by a
powerful neighbour?"

"Then it would be the people's business to fight, madam, and I doubt not
that they would do so in defence of their hearths and homes. Besides,
the neighbour would no longer have the power of invasion were he also
without great vassals. These great barons stand between the king and
his subjects; and a monarch would be a king indeed were he able to rule
without their constant dictation, and undisturbed by their rivalry and
ambitions."

"That would be a good time indeed, Sir Thomas," the queen said, with a
smile; "but methinks there is but little chance of its coming about, for
at present it seems to me that the vassals are better able to make or
unmake kings, than kings are able to deprive the great vassals of
power; and never since Norman William set foot in England were they more
powerful than they are at present. What does my chance of recovering our
throne rest upon? Not upon our right, but on the quarrel between Warwick
and the House of Rivers. We are but puppets that the great lords play
against each other. Did it depend upon my will, it should be as you
say; I would crush them all at a blow. Then only should I feel really a
queen. But that is but a dream that can never be carried out."

"Not in our time, madam. But perhaps it may come sooner than we expect;
and this long war, which has destroyed many great families and weakened
others, may greatly hasten its arrival. I presume until Warwick is ready
to move naught will be done, your Majesty?"

"That is not settled yet. Warwick spoke somewhat of causing a rising
in the north before he set sail, so that a portion at least of Edward's
power may be up there when we make our landing."

"It would be a prudent step, madam. If we can but gain possession of
London, the matter would be half finished. The citizens are ever ready
to take sides with those whom they regard as likely to win, and just as
they shout at present 'Long live King Edward!' so would they shout 'Long
live King Henry!' did you enter the town."

"This may perhaps change the thought that you have entertained, Sir
Thomas, of making your son a Knight of St. John."

"I have not thought the matter over, madam. If there were quiet in the
land I should, were it not for my vow, be well content that he should
settle down in peace at my old hall; but if I see that there is still
trouble and bloodshed ahead, I would in any case far rather that he
should enter the Order, and spend his life in fighting the infidel than
in strife with Englishmen. My good friend, the Grand Prior of the Order
in England, has promised that he will take him as his page, and at
any rate in the House of St. John's he will pass his youth in security
whatsoever fate may befall me. The child himself already bids fair to
do honour to our name, and to become a worthy member of the Order. He is
fond of study, and under my daily tuition is making good progress in the
use of his weapons."

"That is he," the prince said, speaking for the first time, "It was but
yesterday in the great hall downstairs he stood up with blunted swords
against young Victor de Paulliac, who is nigh three years his senior. It
was amusing to see how the little knaves fought against each other;
and by my faith Gervaise held his own staunchly, in spite of Victor's
superior height and weight. If he join the Order, Sir Thomas, I warrant
me he will cleave many an infidel's skull, and will do honour to the
langue of England."

"I hope so, prince," the knight said gravely. "The Moslems ever gain in
power, and it may well be that the Knights of St. John will be hardly
pressed to hold their own. If the boy joins them it will be my wish that
he shall as early as possible repair to Rhodes. I do not wish him to
become one of the drones who live in sloth at their commanderies in
England, and take no part in the noble struggle of the Order with the
Moslem host, who have captured Constantinople and now threaten all
Europe. We were childless some years after our marriage, and Eleanor and
I vowed that were a son born to us he should join the Order of the White
Cross, and dedicate his life to the defence of Christian Europe against
the infidel. Our prayers for a son were granted, and Gervaise will enter
the Order as soon as his age will permit him. That is why I rejoice at
the grand prior's offer to take him as his page, for he will dwell in
the hospital safely until old enough to take the first steps towards
becoming a knight of the Order."

"I would that I had been born the son of a baron like yourself," the
prince said earnestly, "and that I were free to choose my own career.
Assuredly in that case I too would have joined the noble Order and
have spent my life in fighting in so grand a cause, free from all the
quarrels and disputes and enmities that rend England. Even should I some
day gain a throne, surely my lot is not to be envied. Yet, as I have
been born to the rank, I must try for it, and I trust to do so worthily
and bravely. But who can say what the end will be? Warwick has ever
been our foe, and though my royal mother may use him in order to free my
father, and place him on the throne, she must know well enough that he
but uses us for his own ends alone, and that he will ever stand beside
the throne and be the real ruler of England."

"For a time, Edward," the queen broke in. "We have shown that we can
wait, and now it seems that our great hope is likely to be fulfilled.
After that, the rest will be easy. There are other nobles, well nigh as
powerful as he, who look with jealousy upon the way in which he lords
it, and be assured that they will look with a still less friendly eye
upon him when he stands, as you say, beside the throne, once your father
is again seated there. We can afford to bide our time, and assuredly it
will not be long before a party is formed against Warwick. Until then
we must bear everything. Our interests are the same. If he is content
to remain a prop to the throne, and not to eclipse it, the memory of
the past will not stand between us, and I shall regard him as the weapon
that has beaten down the House of York and restored us to our own, and
shall give him my confidence and friendship. If, on the other hand,
he assumes too much, and tries to lord it over us, I shall seek other
support and gather a party which even he will be unable successfully to
withstand. I should have thought, Edward, that you would be even more
glad than I that this long time of weary waiting for action is over, and
that once again the banner of Lancaster will be spread to the winds."

"I shall be that, mother. Rather would I meet death in the field than
live cooped up here, a pensioner of France. But I own that I should feel
more joy at the prospect if the people of England had declared in our
favour, instead of its being Warwick--whom you have always taught me to
fear and hate--who thus comes to offer to place my father again on the
throne, and whose goodwill towards us is simply the result of pique and
displeasure because he is no longer first in the favour of Edward. It
does not seem to me that a throne won by the aid of a traitor can be a
stable one."

"You are a foolish boy," the queen said angrily. "Do you not see that by
marrying Warwick's daughter you will attach him firmly to us?"

"Marriages do not count for much, mother. Another of Warwick's daughters
married Clarence, Edward's brother, and yet he purposes to dethrone
Edward."

The queen gave an angry gesture and said, "You have my permission to
retire, Edward. I am in no mood to listen to auguries of evil at the
present moment."

The prince hesitated for a moment as if about to speak, but with an
effort controlled himself, and bowing deeply to his mother, left the
room.

"Edward is in a perverse humour," the queen said in a tone of much
vexation to Sir Thomas Tresham, when Gervaise had left the room.
"However, I know he will bear himself well when the hour of trial
comes."

"That I can warrant he will, madam; he has a noble character, frank and
fearless, and yet thoughtful beyond his years. He will make, I believe,
a noble king, and may well gather round him all parties in the state.
But your Majesty must make excuses for his humour. Young people are
strong in their likes and dislikes. He has never heard you speak aught
but ill of Warwick, and he knows how much harm the Earl has done to your
House. The question of expediency does not weigh with the young as with
their elders. While you see how great are the benefits that will accrue
from an alliance with Warwick, and are ready to lay aside the hatred of
years and to forget the wrongs you have suffered, the young prince is
unable so quickly to forget that enmity against the Earl that he has
learnt from you."

"You are right, Sir Thomas, and I cannot blame Edward that he is unable,
as I am, to forget the past. What steps would you advise that I myself
should take? Shall I remain passive here, or shall I do what I can to
rouse our partisans in England?"

"I should say the latter, madam. Of course it will not do to trust to
letters, for were one of these to fall into the wrong hands it might
cause the ruin of Warwick's expedition; but I should say that a cautious
message sent by word of mouth to some of our old adherents would be of
great use. I myself will, if your Majesty chooses to entrust me with the
mission, undertake to carry it out. I should take ship and land in the
west, and would travel in the guise of a simple country gentleman,
and call upon your adherents in all the western counties. It would be
needful first to make out a list of the nobles who have shown themselves
devoted to your cause, and I should bid these hold themselves and their
retainers in readiness to take the field suddenly. I should say no word
of Warwick, but merely hint that you will not land alone, but with a
powerful array, and that all the chances are in your favour."

"But it would be a dangerous mission, Sir Thomas."

"Not greatly so, madam. My own estates lie in Sussex, and there would be
but little chance of my recognition, save by your own adherents, who may
have seen me among the leaders of your troops in battle; and even that
is improbable. At present Edward deems himself so securely seated on
the throne that men can travel hither and thither through the country
without being questioned, and the Lancastrians live quietly with the
Yorkists. Unless I were so unfortunate as to meet a Yorkist noble who
knew that I was a banished man and one who had the honour of being in
your Majesty's confidence, I do not think that any danger could possibly
arise. What say you, wife?"

"I cannot think that there is no danger," Lady Tresham said; "but even
so I would not say a word to hinder you from doing service to the cause.
I know of no one else who could perform the mission. You have left my
side to go into battle before now, and I cannot think that the danger
of such an expedition can be as great as that which you would undergo
in the field. Therefore, my dear lord, I would say no word now to stay
you."

She spoke bravely and unfalteringly, but her face had paled when Sir
Thomas first made the proposal, and the colour had not yet come back to
her cheeks.

"Bravely spoken, dame," the queen said warmly. "Well, Sir Thomas, I
accept your offer, and trust that you will not be long separated from
your wife and son, who will of course journey with me when I go to
England, where doubtless you will be able to rejoin us a few days after
we land. Now let us talk over the noblemen and gentlemen in the west,
upon whom we can rely, if not to join our banner as soon as it is
spread, at least to say no word that will betray you."

Two days later Sir Thomas Tresham started on his journey, while the
queen remained at Amboise eagerly awaiting the news that Warwick had
collected a fleet, and was ready to set sail. Up to this point the Duke
of Clarence had sided with Warwick against his brother, and had passed
over with him to France, believing, no doubt, that if the Earl should
succeed in dethroning Edward, he intended to place him, his son-in-law,
upon the throne. He was rudely awakened from this delusion by Charles of
Burgundy, who, being in all but open rebellion against his suzerain,
the King of France, kept himself intimately acquainted with all that was
going on. He despatched a female emissary to Clarence to inform him
of the league Warwick had made with the Lancastrians, and the intended
marriage between his daughter Anne and the young prince; imploring him
to be reconciled with his brother and to break off his alliance with the
Earl, who was on the point of waging war against the House of York.

Clarence took the advice, and went over to England, where he made his
peace with Edward, the more easily because the king, who was entirely
given up to pleasure, treated with contempt the warnings the Duke
of Burgundy sent him of the intended invasion by Warwick. And yet a
moment's serious reflection should have shown him that his position was
precarious. The crushing exactions of the tax gatherers, in order to
provide the means for Edward's lavish expenditure, had already caused
very serious insurrections in various parts of the country, and his
unpopularity was deep and general. In one of these risings the royal
troops had suffered a crushing defeat. The Earl Rivers, the father, and
Sir John Woodville, one of the brothers, of the queen had, with the Earl
of Devon, been captured by the rebels, and the three had been beheaded,
and the throne had only been saved by the intervention of Warwick.

Thus, then, Edward had every reason for fearing the result should the
Earl appear in arms against him. He took, however, no measures whatever
to prepare for the coming storm, and although the Duke of Burgundy
despatched a fleet to blockade Harfleur, where Warwick was fitting out
his expedition, and actually sent the name of the port at which the Earl
intended to land if his fleet managed to escape from Harfleur, Edward
continued carelessly to spend his time in pleasure and dissipation,
bestowing his full confidence upon the Archbishop of York and the
Marquis of Montague, both brothers of the Earl of Warwick.

The elements favoured his enemies, for early in September the Duke of
Burgundy's Fleet, off Harfleur, was dispersed by a storm, and Warwick,
as soon as the gale abated, set sail, and on the 13th landed on the
Devonshire coast. His force was a considerable one, for the French king
had furnished him both with money and men; on effecting his landing
he found no army assembled to oppose him. A few hours after his
disembarkation, he was joined by Sir Thomas Tresham, who gave him the
good news that the whole of the west was ready to rise, and that in a
few days all the great landowners would join him with their retainers.
This turned out to be the case, and Warwick, with a great array, marched
eastward. Kent had already risen, and London declared for King
Henry. Warwick, therefore, instead of marching thither, moved towards
Lincolnshire, where Edward was with his army, having gone north to
repress an insurrection that had broken out there at the instigation of
Warwick.
