    Sovereign of the gods, Hutasa,--where is she who would not wed?
    He, in awe of whose dread sceptre[39]--all the assembled hosts of men,
    Cultivate eternal justice--where is she who would not wed?
    Him the all-righteous, lofty minded,--slayer of the infernal host,[40]
    Of all gods, the mighty monarch,--who is she that would not wed?
    Nor let trembling doubt arrest thee--in thy mind if thou couldst choose.[41]
    Varuna, amongst earth's guardians,--hear the language of a friend."
      To the sovereign of Nishadha--Damayanti spake, and said,
    And her eyes grew dim with moisture--flowing from her inward grief:--
    "To the gods, to all, my homage--king of earth, I humbly pay;
    Yet thee only, thee, my husband--may I choose, Be this my vow!"
    Answered he the trembling maiden--as with folded hands she stood,
    "Bound upon this solemn mission--mine own cause how dare I urge.
    Plighted by a sacred promise--to the everlasting gods;
    Thus engaged to plead for others--for myself I may not plead.
    This my duty; yet hereafter--come I on my own behalf,
    Then I'll plead mine own cause boldly--weigh it, beauteous, in thy thought."
    Damayanti smiled serenely,--and with tear-impeded speech,
    Uttered brokenly and slowly--thus to royal Nala spake:--
    "Yet I see a way of refuge--'tis a blameless way, O king;
    Whence no sin to thee, O raja,--may by any chance arise.
    Thou, O noblest of all mortals--and the gods by Indra led,
    Come and enter in together--where the Swayembara meets;
    Then will I, before the presence--of the guardians of the world,
    Name thee, lord of men! my husband--nor to thee may blame accrue."
      By the maiden of Vidarbha--royal Nala thus addressed,
    Back again returned, where waited--eager, the expecting gods.
    Him, the guardians of the world, the mighty--ere he yet drew near, beheld,
    Him they saw, and bade him instant--all his tidings to unfold--
    "Was she seen of thee, O monarch--Damayanti with soft smile?
    Spake she of us all? what said she?--tell, O blameless lord of earth."

    NALA _spake_.

    To the bower of Damayanti--on your solemn mission sent,
    Entered I the lofty portal--by the aged warders watched;
    Mortal eye might not behold me--there as swift I entered in;
    None save that fair raja's daughter--through your all prevailing power.
    And her virgin handmaids, saw I--and by them in turn was seen;
    And they all in mute amazement--gazed upon me as I stood.
    I described your godlike presence--but the maid with beauteous face
    Chooses me, bereft of reason--O most excellent of gods!
    Thus she spake, that maiden princess,--"Let the gods together come,
    Come with thee, Oh king of mortals,--where the Swayembara meets;
    There will I, before their presence--choose thee, raja, for my lord.
    So to thee, O strong armed warrior--may no blame, no fault ensue."
    Thus it was, even as I tell you--word for word did it befall.
    Plainly have I spoke, the judgment--rests with you, of gods the chief!




BOOK V.


    Came the day of happy omen[42]--moonday meet, and moment apt;
    Bhima to the Swayembara--summoned all the lords of earth.
    One and all, upon the instant--rose th' enamoured lords of earth,
    Suitors all to Damayanti--in their loving haste they came.
    They, the court with golden columns[43]--rich, and glittering portal arch,
    Like the lions on the mountains--entered they the hall of state.
    There the lords of earth were seated--each upon his several throne;
    All their fragrant garlands wearing--all with pendant ear-gems rich.
    Arms were seen robust and vigorous--as the ponderous battle mace,
    Some like the five-headed serpents--delicate in shape and hue:[44]
    With bright locks profuse and flowing--fine formed nose, and eye and brow,
    Shone the faces of the rajas--like the radiant stars in heaven.
    As with serpents, Bhogavati[45]--the wide hall was full of kings;
    As the mountain caves with tigers--with the tiger-warriors full.
    Damayanti in her beauty--entered on that stately scene,
    With her dazzling light entrancing--every eye and every soul.
    O'er her lovely person gliding--all the eyes of those proud kings;
    There were fixed, there moveless rested--as they gazed upon the maid.
    Then as they proclaimed the rajas--(by his name was each proclaimed)
    In dismay saw Bhima's daughter--five in garb, in form the same.
    On those forms, all undistinguished--each from each, she stood and gazed.
    In her doubt Vidarbha's princess--Nala's form might not discern,[46]
    Whichsoe'er the form she gazed on--him her Nala, him she thought.
    She within her secret spirit--deeply pondering, stood and thought:
    "How shall I the gods distinguish?--royal Nala how discern?"
    Pondering thus Vidarbha's maiden--in the anguish of her heart--
    Th' attributes of the immortals--sought, as heard of yore, to see.
    "Th' attributes of each celestial--that our aged sires describe,
    As on earth they stand before me--not of one may I discern."
    Long she pondered in her silence--and again, again she thought.
    To the gods, her only refuge--turned she at this trying hour.
    With her voice and with her spirit--she her humble homage paid.
    Folding both her hands and trembling--to the gods the maiden spake:
    "As when heard the swan's sweet language--chose I then Nishadha's king,
    By this truth I here adjure ye--oh, ye gods, reveal my lord;
    As in word or thought I swerve not--from my faith, all-knowing powers,
    By this truth I here adjure ye--oh, ye gods, reveal my lord.
    As the gods themselves have destined--for my lord Nishadha's king;
    By this truth I here adjure ye--oh, ye gods, my lord reveal.
    As my vow, so pledged to Nala--holily must be maintained,
    By this truth I here adjure ye--oh, ye gods, my lord reveal.
    Each the form divine assume ye--earth's protectors, mighty lords;
    So shall I discern my Nala--I shall know the king of men."
      As they heard sad Damayanti--uttering thus her piteous prayer,
    At her high resolve they wonder--steadfast truth and fervent love,
    Holiness of soul, and wisdom--to her lord her constant faith.
    As she prayed, the gods obedient--stood with attributes revealed:
    With unmoistened skins the Immortals--saw she, and with moveless eyes;[47]
    Fresh their dust-unsullied garlands--hovered they, nor touched the earth.
    On his shadow garland-drooping[48]--soiled with dust and moist with sweat,
    On the earth Nishadha's monarch--stood confessed, with twinkling eyes;
    On the gods an instant gazed she--then upon the king of men;
    And of right king Bhima's daughter--named Nishadha's king her lord.
    Modestly the large-eyed maiden--lifted up his garment's hem,
    Round his shoulders threw she lightly--the bright zone of radiant flowers;
    So she chose him for her husband--Nala, that high-hearted maid.
    Then alas! alas! burst wildly,--from that conclave of the kings,
    And "well done, well done," as loudly--from the gods and sages broke;
    All in their extatic wonder--glorified Nishadha's king.
    Then to royal Damayanti--Virasena's kingly son,
    To that slender waisted damsel--spake he comfort in his joy;
    "Since thou'st own'd me for thine husband--in the presence of the gods,
    For thy faithful consort know me--aye delighting in thy words.
    While this spirit fills this body--maiden with the smile serene!
    Thine am I, so long thine only--this the solemn truth I vow."
    Thus he gladdened Damayanti--with the assurance of his faith;
    And the happy pair devoutly[49]--worshipped then the present gods.
      Chosen thus Nishadha's monarch--the bright guardians of the world,
    In their gladness all on Nala--eight transcendant gifts bestowed;
    To discern the visible godhead--in the sacrifice, a gait
    Firm and noble, Sachi's husband--Indra to king Nala gave.
    Agni gave his own bright presence[50]--whensoe'er the monarch called.
    All the worlds instinct with splendour--through his power Hutasa gave.
    Subtle taste in food gave Yama--and in virtue eminence;
    Varun gave obedient water--to be present at his call;
    Garlands too of matchless fragrance;--each his double blessing gave.[51]
    Thus bestowed their gracious favours--to the heavens the gods returned;
    And the rajas, who with wonder--Nala's marriage saw confirmed
    With the gentle Damayanti--as they came, in joy returned.
    Thus the kings of earth departed;--Bhima in his joy and pride,
    Solemnized the stately bridals--of the maiden and the king.
    Fitting time when there he'd sojourned,--best of men, Nishadha's king;
    Courteous parting with king Bhima--to his native city went.
    Having gained the pearl of women--the majestic lord of earth
    Lived in bliss, as with his Sachi,[52]--he that those old giants slew.
    In his joy the elated monarch--shining radiant as the sun,
    Ruled the subjects of his kingdom--with a just and equal sway.
    Of the horse the famous offering[53]--like Nahucha's mighty son,
    Every sacrifice performed he--with rich gifts to holy men.
    And full oft in flowering gardens--and delicious shady groves,
    Like a god, the royal Nala--took with Damayanti joy.
    So begat from Damayanti--Nala, of heroic soul,
    Indrasena one fair daughter--Indrasen one beauteous son.
    Thus in sacrifice and pleasance--took his joy the king of men,
    So the earth with riches teeming--ruled the sovereign of the earth.




BOOK VI.


    Nala, chosen by Bhima's daughter--the bright guardians of the world,
    As they parted thence, with Kali[54]--Dwapara approaching saw.
    Kali as he saw, did Indra--did the giant-killer say,
    "Here, with Dwapara attended--whither, Kali, dost thou go?"
    Kali spake, "the Swayembara--we of Damayanti seek;
    Her I go to make my consort--into her mine heart hath passed."
    "Closed and ended is that bridal,"--Indra answered with a smile,
    "Nala she hath chosen for husband--in the presence of us all."
    Thus addressed by Indra, Kali--in the transport of his wrath,
    All the heavenly gods saluting,--thus his malediction spake,
    "Since before the Immortals' presence--she a mortal spouse did choose,
    Of her impious crime most justly--heavy be the penal doom."
    Kali hardly thus had spoken--than the heaven-born gods replied:
    "With our full and liberal sanction--Damayanti chose her lord.
    Who to Nala, with all virtue--rich endowed, would not incline?
    He that rightly knows each duty--he who ever rightly acts,
    He who reads the whole four Vedas--the Puranas too the fifth,[55]
    In his palace with pure offerings--ever are the gods adored,
    Gentle to all living creatures--true in word and strict in vow;
    Good and constant he, and generous--holy, temperate, patient, pure;
    His are all these virtues ever--equal to the earth-guarding gods.
    Thus endowed, the noble Nala--he, O Kali, that would curse,
    On himself recoil his curses--only fatal to himself.
    Nala, gifted with such virtues--he, O Kali, who would curse--
    Be he plunged in hell's dark torments--in the deep and vasty lake."
    Thus the gods to Kali speaking--to their native heavens arose.
    Soon as they had parted, Kali--thus to Dwapara began:
    "I my wrath can curb no longer--I henceforth in Nala dwell;
    From his kingdom will I cast him--from his bliss with his sweet bride.
    Thou within the dice embodied--Dwapara my cause assist."




BOOK VII.


    Bound by that malignant treaty--Kali with his dark ally,
    Haunted they the stately palace--where Nishadha's monarch ruled;
    Watching still the fatal instant--in Nishadha long they dwelt.
    Twelve long years had passed ere Kali--saw that fatal instant come.
    Nala after act uncleanly--the ablution half performed,[56]
    Prayed at eve, with feet unwashen--Kali seized the fatal hour.
    Into Nala straight he entered--and possessed his inmost soul.
    Pushkara in haste he summoned--come with Nala play at dice,
    Ever in the gainful hazard--by my subtle aid thou'lt win,
    Even the kingdom of Nishadha--even from Nala all his realm.
    Pushkara by Kali summoned--to his brother Nala came,
    In the dice of dice embodied[57]--Dwapara stood silent by.
    Pushkara the hero-slayer--to king Nala standing near:
    "Play we with the dice, my brother,"--thus again, again he said.
    Long the lofty-minded raja--that bold challenge might not brook,
    In Vidarbha's princess' presence--deemed he now the time for play.
    For his wealth, his golden treasures--for his chariots, for his robes,
    Then possessed by Kali, Nala--in the game was worsted still.
    He with love of gaming maddened,--of his faithful friends not one
    Might arrest the desperate frenzy--of the conqueror of his foes.
    Came the citizens assembling--with the counsellors of state,
    To behold the king approached they--to restrain his dread disease.
    Then the charioteer advancing[58]--thus to Damayanti spake:
    "All the city, noble princess--stands assembled at the gate,
    Say thou to Nishadha's monarch--'All his subjects here are met;
    Ill they brook this dire misfortune[59]--in their justice-loving king'."
    Then, her voice half choked with anguish--spake the sorrow-stricken queen,
    Spirit-broken, Bhima's daughter--to Nishadha's sovereign spake,
    "Raja, lo! the assembled city--at the gate their king to see:
    With the counsellors of wisdom--by their loyal duty led.
    Deign thou, monarch, to admit them,"--thus again, again she said.
    To the queen with beauteous eyelids--uttering thus her sad lament,
    Still possessed by wicked Kali--answered not the king a word.
    Then those counsellors of wisdom--and those loyal citizens,
    "'Tis not he," exclaimed in sorrow,--and in shame and grief went home.
    Thus of Pushkara and Nala--still went on that fatal play;
    Many a weary month it lasted--and still lost the king of men.




BOOK VIII.


    Damayanti then beholding--Punyasloka, king of men,[60]
    Undistracted, him distracted--with the maddening love of play.
    In her dread and in her sorrow--thus did Bhima's daughter speak;
    Pondering on the weighty business--that concerned the king of men.
    Trembling at his guilty frenzy--yet to please him still intent.
    Nala, 'reft of all his treasures--when the noble woman saw,
    Thus addressed she Vrihatsena,--her old faithful slave and nurse,
    Friendly in all business dextrous--most devoted, wise in speech:
    "Vrihatsena, go, the council--as at Nala's call convene,
    Say what he hath lost of treasure--and what treasure yet remains."
    Then did all that reverend council--Nala's summons as they heard,
    "Our own fate is now in peril"--speaking thus, approach the king.
    And a second time his subjects--all assembling, crowded near,
    And the queen announced their presence;--of her words he took no heed.
    All her words thus disregarded--when king Bhima's daughter found,
    To the palace, Damayanti--to conceal her shame returned.
    When the dice she heard for ever--adverse to the king of men,
    And of all bereft, her Nala--to the nurse again she spake:
    "Go again, my Vrihatsena,--in the name of Nala, go,
    To the charioteer, Varshneya,--great the deed must now be done."
    Vrihatsena on the instant--Damayanti's words she heard,
    Caused the charioteer be summoned--by her messengers of trust.
    Bhima's daughter to Varshneya--winning with her gentle voice,
    Spake, the time, the place well choosing--for the deed, nor spake in vain:
    "Well thou know'st the full reliance--that in thee the king hath placed,
    In his fatal hour of peril--wilt not thou stand forth to aid?
    As by Pushkara is worsted--ever more and more the king,
    More and more the fatal frenzy--maddens in his heart for play.
    As to Pushkara obedient--ever fall the lucky dice,
    Thus those dice to royal Nala--still with adverse fortune fall.
    Nor the voice of friend or kindred--as beseems him, will he hear;
    Even to me he will not listen--in the madness of his heart.
    Of the lofty-minded Nala--well I know 'tis not the sin,
    That my words this senseless monarch--in his frenzy will not hear.
    Charioteer, to thee my refuge--come I, do thou my behest;
    I am not o'er calm in spirit--haply he may perish thus.
    Yoke the much-loved steeds of Nala--fleet of foot, as thought, are they,
    In the chariot place our children--to Cundina's city go.[61]
    Leave the children with my kindred--and the chariot and the steeds;
    Then or dwell there at thy pleasure--or depart where'er thou wilt."
    When the speech of Damayanti--heard king Nala's charioteer,
    He, the chief of Nala's council--thus in full divan addressed,
    Weighed within their solemn conclave--and their full assent obtained,
    With the children in the chariot--to Vidarbha straight he drove.
    There he rendered up the horses--with the chariot there he left.
    That young maiden Indrasena--Indrasen, that noble boy.
    To king Bhima paid his homage--sad, for Nala's fall distressed,
    Thence departing, to Ayodhya[62]--took the charioteer his way.
    In his grief to Rituparna--that illustrious king, he came,
    As his charioteer, the service--entered of the lord of earth.




BOOK IX.


    Scarce Varshneya had departed--still the king of men played on,
    Till to Pushkara his kingdom--all that he possessed, was lost.
    Nala then, despoiled of kingdom--smiling Pushkara bespake:
    "Throw we yet another hazard--Nala, where is now thy stake?
    There remains but Damayanti--all thou hast beside, is mine.
    Throw we now for Damayanti--come, once more the hazard try."
    Thus as Pushkara addressed him--Punyasloka's inmost heart
    By his grief was rent asunder--not a single word he spake.
    And on Pushkara, king Nala--in his silent anguish gazed.
    All his ornaments of splendour--from his person stripped he off,
    With a single vest, scarce covered,--'mid the sorrow of his friends.
    Slowly wandered forth the monarch--fallen from such an height of bliss.
    Damayanti with one garment--slowly followed him behind.
    Three long nights Nishadha's monarch--there without the gates had dwelt.
    Proclamation through the city--then did Pushkara bid make,
    "Whosoe'er befriendeth Nala--shall to instant death be doomed."
    Thus, as Pushkara gave order--in the terror of his power,
    Might the citizens no longer--hospitably serve the king.
    Near the walls, of kind reception--worthiest, but by none received;
    Three nights longer staid the monarch--water was his only drink,
    He in unfastidious hunger--plucked the fruits, the roots of earth.
    Then went forth again the outcast:--Damayanti followed slow.
    In the agony of famine--Nala, after many days,
    Saw some birds around him settling--with their golden tinctured wings.
    Then the monarch of Nishadha--thought within his secret heart,
    These to-day my welcome banquet--and my treasure these will be.
    Over them his single garment--spreading light he wrapped them round:
    Up that single garment bearing--to the air they sprang away;
    And the birds above him hovering--thus in human accents spake,
    Naked as they saw him standing--on the earth, and sad, and lone:--
    "Lo, we are the dice, to spoil thee--thus descended, foolish king!
    While thou hadst a single garment--all our joy was incomplete."
    When the dice he saw departing--and himself without his robe,
    Mournfully did Punyasloka--thus to Damayanti speak:
    "They, O blameless, by whose anger--from my kingdom I am driven,
    Life-sustaining food unable--in my misery to find--
    They, through whom Nishadha's people--may not house their outcast king--
    They, the forms of birds assuming--my one robe have borne away.
    In the dark extreme of misery--sad and frantic as I am,
    Hear me, princess, hear and profit--by thy husband's best advice.
    Hence are many roads diverging--to the region of the south,[63]
    Passing by Avanti's city[64]--and the height of Rishavan;
    Vindhya here, the mighty mountain[65]--and Payoshni's seaward stream;[66]
    And the lone retreats of hermits--on the fruits of earth that live;
    This will lead thee to Vidarbha--this to Cosala away,[67]
    Far beyond the region stretches--southward to the southward clime."
    In these words to Damayanti--did the royal Nala speak,
    More than once to Bhima's daughter--anxious pointing out the way.
    She, with voice half choked with sorrow--with her weight of woe oppressed,
    These sad words did Damayanti--to Nishadha's monarch speak:--
    "My afflicted heart is breaking--and my sinking members fail,
    When, O king, thy desperate counsel--once I think of, once again.
    Robbed of kingdom, robbed of riches--naked, thirst and hunger worn;
    How shall I depart and leave thee--in the wood by man untrod.
    When thou sad and famine-stricken--thinkest of thy former bliss,
    In the wild wood, oh, my husband,--I thy weariness will soothe.
    Like a wife, in every sorrow--this the wise physicians own,
    Healing herb is none or balsam--Nala, 'tis the truth I speak."

    NALA _spake_.

    Slender-waisted Damayanti--true, indeed, is all thou'st said;
    Like a wife no friendly medicine--to afflicted man is given.
    Fear not that I thee abandon--Wherefore, timid, dread'st thou this?
    Oh, myself might I abandon--and not thee, thou unreproached.

    DAMAYANTI _spake_.

    If indeed, oh mighty monarch--thou wilt ne'er abandon me,
    Wherefore then towards Vidarbha--dost thou point me out the way.
    Well, I know thee, noble Nala--to desert me far too true,
    Only with a soul distracted--would'st thou leave me, lord of earth.
    Yet, again, the way thou pointest--yet, again, thou best of men,
    Thus my sorrow still enhancing--oh, thou like the immortal gods;
    If this be thy better counsel--'to her kindred let her go,'
    Be it so, and both together--to Vidarbha set we forth.
    Thee Vidarbha's king will honour--honour'd in his turn by thee;
    Held in high respect and happy--in our mansion thou shall dwell.




BOOK X.


    NALA _spake_.

    "Mighty is thy father's kingdom--once was mine as mighty too;
    Never will I there seek refuge--in my base extremity.
    There I once appeared in glory--to the exalting of thy pride;
    Shall I now appear in misery--to the increasing of thy shame?"
    Nala thus to Damayanti--spake again, and yet again,
    Comforting the noble lady--scant in half a garment clad.
    Both together by one garment[68]--covered, roamed they here and there;
    Wearied out by thirst and famine--to a cabin drew they near.
    When they reached that lowly cabin--then did great Nishadha's king
    With the princess of Vidarbha--on the hard earth seat them down;
    Naked, with no mat to rest on--wet with mire and stained with dust.
    Weary then with Damayanti--on the earth he fell asleep.
    Sank the lovely Damayanti--by his side with sleep opprest,
    She thus plunged in sudden misery--she the tender, the devout.
    But while on the cold earth slumbered--Damayanti, all distraught
    Nala in his mind by sorrow--might no longer calmly sleep;
    For the losing of his kingdom--the desertion of his friends,
    And his weary forest wanderings--painful on his thought arose;
    "If I do it, what may follow?--what if I refuse to do?
    Were my instant death the better--or to abandon her I love.
    But to me too deep devoted--suffers she distress and shame;
    Reft of me she home may wander--to her royal father's house;
    Faithful wandering ever with me--certain sorrow will she bear,
    But if separated from me--chance of solace may be hers."
    Long within his heart he pondered--and again, again weighed o'er.
    Best he thought it Damayanti--to desert, that wretched king.
    From her virtue none dare harm her[69]--in the lonely forest way,
    Her the fortunate, the noble--my devoted wedded wife.
    Thus his mind on Damayanti--dwelt in its perverted thought,
    Wrought by Kali's evil influence--to desert his lovely wife.
    Of himself without a garment--and of her with only one.
    As he thought, approached he near her--to divide that single robe.
    "How shall I divide the garment--by my loved one unperceived?"
    Pondering this within his spirit--round the cabin Nala went;
    In that narrow cabin's circuit--Nala wandered here and there,
    Till he found without a scabbard--shining, a well-tempered sword.
    Then when half that only garment--he had severed, and put on,
    In her sleep Vidarbha's princess--with bewildered mind he fled.
    Yet, his cruel heart relenting--to the cabin turns he back;
    On the slumbering Damayanti--gazing, sadly wept the king;
    "Thou, that sun nor wind hath ever--roughly visited, my love!
    On the hard earth in a cabin--sleepest with thy guardian gone.
    Thus attired in half a garment--she that aye so sweetly smiled,
    Like to one distracted, beauteous--how at length will she awake?
    How will't fare with Bhima's daughter--lone, abandoned by her lord,
    Wandering in the savage forest--where wild beasts and serpents dwell.
    May the suns and winds of heaven--may the genii of the woods,[70]
    Noblest, may they all protect thee--thine own virtue thy best guard."
    To his wife of peerless beauty--on the earth, 'twas thus he spoke.
    Then of sense bereft by Kali--Nala hastily set forth;
    And departing, still departing--he returned again, again;
    Dragged away by that bad demon--ever by his love drawn back.
    Nala, thus his heart divided--into two conflicting parts,
    Like a swing goes backward, forward--from the cabin, to and fro.
    Torn away at length by Kali--flies afar the frantic king,
    Leaving there his wife in slumber--making miserable moans.
    Reft of sense, possessed by Kali--thinking still on her he left,
    Passed he in the lonely forest--leaving his deserted wife.




BOOK XI.


    Scarcely had king Nala parted--Damayanti now refreshed,
    Wakened up, the slender-waisted--timorous in the desert wood.
    When she did not see her husband--overpowered with grief and pain,
    Loud she shriek'd in her first anguish--"Where art thou, Nishadha's king?
    Mighty king! my soul-protector--O, my lord! desert'st thou me.
    Oh, I'm lost! undone for ever--helpless in the wild wood left;
    Faithful once to every duty--wert thou not, and true in word.
    Art thou faithful to thy promise--to desert me thus in sleep.
    Could'st thou then depart, forsaking--thy devoted, constant wife;
    Her in sooth that never wronged thee--wronged indeed, but not by her.
    Keep'st thou thus thy solemn promise--oh, unfaithful lord of men,
    There, when all the gods were present--plighted to thy wedded wife?
    Death is but decreed to mortals--at its own appointed time,
    Hence one moment, thus deserted[71]--one brief moment do I live.--
    But thou'st had thy sport--enough then--now desist, O king of men,
    Mock not thou a trembling woman--show thee to me, O my lord!
    Yes, I see thee, there I see thee--hidden as thou think'st from sight,
    In the rushes why conceal thee?--answer me, why speak'st thou not.
    Wherefore now ungentle stay'st thou--like to one forsworn, aloof?
    Wherefore wilt thou not approach me--to console me in my woe?
    For myself I will not sorrow--nor for aught to me befalls.
    Thou art all alone, my husband,--I will only mourn for thee.
    How will't fare with thee, my Nala--thirsting, famished, faint with toil.
    Nor beholding me await thee--underneath the trees at eve."
    Then, in all her depth of anguish--with her trouble as on fire,
    Hither, thither, went she weeping--all around she went and wailed.
    Now springs up the desolate princess--now falls down in prostrate grief;
    Now she pines in silent sorrow--now she shrieks and wails aloud.
    So consumed with inward misery--ever sighing more and more,
    Spake at length king Bhima's daughter--spake the still devoted wife:
    "He, by whose dire imprecation--Nala this dread suffering bears,
    May he far surpass in suffering--all that Nala suffers now,
    May the evil one, to evil--who the blameless Nala drives,
    Smitten by a curse as fatal--live a dark unblessed life."
    Thus her absent lord lamenting--that high-minded raja's queen,
    Every-where her lord went seeking--in the satyr-haunted wood.[72]
    Like a maniac, Bhima's daughter--wandered wailing here and there;
    And "alas! alas! my husband"--every-where her cry was heard.
    Her beyond all measure wailing--like the osprey screaming shrill,
    Miserably still deploring--still renewing her lament.
    Suddenly king Bhima's daughter--as she wandered near his lair,
    Seized a huge gigantic serpent--in his raging famine fierce.
    In the grasp of that fierce serpent--round about with terror girt,
    Not herself she pities only--pities she Nishadha's king.
    "O my guardian, thus unguarded--in this savage forest seized,
    Seized by this terrific serpent--wherefore art not thou at hand?
    How will't be, when thou rememberest--once again thy faithful wife,
    From this dreadful curse delivered--mind, and sense, and wealth returned?
    When thou'rt weary, when thou'rt hungry--when thou'rt fainting with fatigue,
