Ingoldsby, the Lieutenant-Governor, arrived in New York without the
Governor.  However he sent to Leisler asking him to allow the soldiers
he had brought to enter the fort.  This request made Leisler very
angry.  He refused to allow the soldiers to enter the fort unless
Ingoldsby showed him orders in writing either from the King or
Governor.

This Ingoldsby could not do, for all the orders were in the
Governor's ship, and where that was he could not tell.  And finding
that Leisler would yield to no reasoning, after four days he landed
his men with as much care as if he had been making a descent into
an enemy's country, and lodged them in the town hall.

So six weeks passed.  Ingoldsby was determined to stay, Leisler just
as determined that he should go.  At length Leisler sent Ingoldsby
a notice to disband his force in two hours, or take the consequences.
Ingoldsby refused to disband his force.  So from the fort Leisler
fired upon the soldiers in the town hall, and several were killed.
More trouble seemed likely to follow, but some of Leisler's soldiers
had already had enough, so they laid down their arms and went home.

Next day Governor Sloughter arrived.  Hearing of all the commotion
he landed hastily, and going to the town hall ordered the bell to
be rung, and his commission to be read to the people.

Then he sent Ingoldsby to demand the surrender of the fort.

But Leisler was by this time crazy with the idea of his own importance.
He refused to give up the fort until he received orders from the
King direct, addressed to his very own self.  This was absurd, for
the King was hardly conscious of Leisler's existence.  The Governor
therefore paid no attention to these proud demands, and sent
Ingoldsby again to demand possession of the fort.

Again Leisler refused.  It could not be done so easily as all that,
he said.

Still a third time the Governor demanded the fort.  And again with
scorn Leisler refused.

It was now nearly midnight, and the Governor decided to do nothing
more till morning.

With morning reason seemed to return to Leisler.  He wrote a letter
to the Governor begging him to take the fort.  But the Governor
took no notice of the letter.  He simply sent Ingoldsby to command
the garrison to give up their arms and march out, promising at the
same time free pardon to every one except Leisler and his Council.
The men obeyed at once.  They marched out and Leisler found himself
a prisoner.

For two years he had lorded it in New York.  Now his day was done.
After a short trial he and his friend and son-in-law Milborne were
condemned to death, and hanged as traitors.

At the time many applauded this severity, but afterwards most people
were sorry.  For after all Leisler had meant well, and in spite of
his arrogance he had still many friends left.  He was now looked
upon as a martyr, and for many a long day New York was torn asunder
with bitter strife over his tragic ending.

Chapter 38 - Pirates!




Colonel Sloughter whose rule began in such stormy times proved
no good Governor.  Indeed he was a bad man as well as a bad ruler.
Others followed who were not a bit better, one at least being accused
of being in league with the pirates who were now the terror of the
seas.

The seventeenth century has been called "The Golden Age of Piracy."
Never before or since have pirates had such a splendid time.  After
the discovery of America, the number of ships sailing the seas
increased rapidly, until all the chief countries of Europe had
far more ships afloat than they could possibly protect with their
navies.  So they readily became a prey to pirates.

Then, as they could not protect their merchantmen with their
warships, most countries allowed private people in time of war to
fit out ships armed with guns to capture the merchant shipping of
the enemy.  These ships were simply private men of war, and were
called privateers.  They always carried "letters of marque and
reprisal" Which gave them the legal right to commit against enemy
ships acts which, without those letters of marque, would have been
considered acts of piracy.  In the long run these privateers often
became little better than pirates, and it has been said "privateers
in time of war were a nursery for pirates against a peace."

The pirates' life was one of reckless daring.  They were idle,
swaggering, brutal.  All the summer they sailed the seas, a terror
to peaceful merchantmen, and when winter came, or when they were
tired of plundering, they would retire to the West India Islands
or Madagascar.  Here, hidden in the depths of forests, they built
for themselves strong castles surrounded by moats and walls.  The
paths leading to these castles were made with the greatest cunning.
They were so narrow that people could only go in single file.  They
crossed and re-crossed in every direction, so that the castle was
surrounded by a maze, and any one not knowing the secret might wander
for hours without being able to find the dwelling which could not
be seen until one was close upon it.

In these savage fastnesses the pirates lived in squalid splendour.
They had numbers of slaves to wait upon them, the finest wines and
foods, the richest dress and jewels, spoils of their travels.  And
when they had drunk and rioted in idleness to their heart's content
they would once more set sail, and roam the seas in search of fresh
adventure.

All sorts of people took to piracy, and scampish sons of noble
houses might be found side by side with the lowest of scoundrels and
vagabonds.  In fact in those days any man who had a grudge against
the world might turn pirate.  Even women were found among them.

A jovial, brutal crew, they swaggered and swore their way through
life.  And if the gallows at the end always loomed over them what
then? There was always plenty of rum in which to drown the thought.

Some of the pirates became very famous.  The very sight of the Jolly
Roger, as the pirates' black flag was called, struck terror to the
hearts of merchantmen, and it is said that one pirate captured and
sunk as many as four hundred ships before he was caught.  Yet these
ruffians often had dealings with seemingly respectable tradesmen.
Having captured a few ships, and taken all the booty on board his
own, the pirate would sail for some port.  There he would show some
old letters of marque, swear that he was a privateer, and had captured
the goods lawfully from the enemy, for the world was always at war
in those days.  And as the goods were going cheap, too many questions
would not be asked.  Thus a profitable trade was done.

The Navigation Laws too helped pirates to thrive on the coasts
of America.  For they seemed so unjust and burdensome that people
thought it no wrong to evade them.  So, often, piracy and smuggling
went hand in hand.

At length piracy grew so bad that people felt that something must
be done to stop it.  And when an Irishman named Lord Bellomont came
out as Governor in 1696 he set about doing it.  It was decided that
the best way to do it was to send a swift and well-armed frigate
under a captain who knew their haunts and ways, to catch these
sea-robbers.  For this, Captain Kidd, a tried sailor, was chosen, and
he set sail with a somewhat ruffianly crew in the ship Adventure.
But Captain Kidd was unlucky.  Though he roamed the seas and sought
the pirates in the haunts he knew so well he found never a one.

Nor could he find even enemy ships which, as a privateer, he might
have attacked.  Dutch ships, ships of the Great Mogul he met.  But
Britain was at peace with Holland and on most friendly terms with
the heathen potentate.  Pirates and ships of France he could not
find.

Food and money were nearly gone, the crew grew mutinous.  They had
come forth for adventure, and not to sail the seas thus tamely and
on short rations to boot.  So there was angry talk between the crew
and captain.  Plainly they told him that the next ship which came
in sight, be it friend or foe, should be their prey.  Kidd grew
furious, and, seizing a hatchet, he hit one of the men on the head
so that he fell senseless on the deck and died.  Alone he stood
against his mutinous crew.  But in the end he gave way to them.  He
turned pirate, and any ship which came his way was treated as a
lawful prize.

For two years after Captain Kidd left New York nothing was heard of
him.  Then strange and disquieting rumours came home.  It was said
that he who had been sent to hunt pirates had turned pirate himself;
that he who had been sent as a protection had become a terror to
honest traders.  So orders were accordingly sent to Lord Bellomont
to arrest Captain Kidd.  A royal proclamation was also issued offering
free pardon to all pirates save two, one of whom was William Kidd.

This was the news which greeted the new-made pirate when he arrived
one day at a port in the West Indies.  But those were lawless days.
Captain Kidd's ship was laden with great treasure-treasure enough,
he thought, to win forgiveness.  At least he decided to brazen it
out, and he set sail for New York.

His ship was no longer the Adventure but the Quedah Merchant.  For
the Adventure, being much battered after two years' seafaring, he
had sunk her, and taken one of his many prizes instead.  But on the
way home he left the Quedah Merchant at San Domingo with all her
rich cargo and, taking only the gold and jewels, he set sail again
in a small sloop.

As he neared New York his heart failed him, and he began to think
that after all forgiveness might not be won so easily.  Cautiously
he crept up to New York, only to learn that the Governor was at
Boston.  So he sent a messenger to the Governor confessing that acts
of piracy had been committed, but without his authority.  They were
done, he said, when the men were in a state of mutiny, and had
locked him up in his cabin.

Lord Bellomont was broad-minded and just, and had no desire to
condemn a man unheard; so he sent back a message to Captain Kidd
saying, "If you can prove your story true you can rely on me to
protect you."

But Captain Kidd's story did not satisfy Lord Bellomont; so he was
put into prison, and later sent home to England to be tried.  There
he was condemned to death and hanged as a pirate in 1701.  Some
people, however, never believed in his guilt.  Whether he was guilty
or not there is little doubt that he did not have a fair trial,
and that he was by no means the shameless ruffian he was made out
to be.

What became of the Quedah Merchant and all her rich cargo was
never known.  Indeed the most of Kidd's ill-gotten gains entirely
disappeared.  For when his sloop was searched very little treasure
was found.  So then it was said that Captain Kidd must have buried
his treasure somewhere before he reached Boston.  And for a hundred
years and more afterwards all along the shore of Long Island Sound
people now and again would start a search of buried treasure.  But
none was ever found.

Before his pirate friend met his end Lord Bellomont died.  He was
one of the few Governors the people had loved, and they sorrowed
truly at his death.  He was followed by Lord Cornby, a very bad man.
Nevertheless in spite of Governors good and bad New York prospered.
Every fresh tyranny in Europe which sent freedom-seekers to America
added to the population.  And as the first settlers were Dutch, New
York had a more un-English population than almost any other of the
colonies.

Chapter 39 - The Founding of New Jersey




Out of New York another state had been carved.  For before New York
had been taken from the Dutch, before Nicholls had so much as reached
the shores of America, James, Duke of York, had already given part
of the land which he did not yet possess to two of his friends, Lord
Berkeley and Sir George Carteret.  Sir George had been Governor of
the Island of Jersey in the English Channel.  When the Revolution
broke out in England he had defended the island stoutly against
the soldiers of the Parliament, and had kept the King's flag flying
on British soil longer than any other man.  So now that the Stuarts
were restored King Charles remembered Carteret's loyalty, and he
called this tract of land New Jersey in his honour.  For this great
estate Sir George and Lord Berkeley had to pay only ten shillings
a year and a peppercorn.

Nicholls of course knew nothing about these grants, and when he
heard of them he was grieved that the Duke should have given away
so much valuable land.  He had besides allowed some Puritans from
New England and others to settle on the land after making agreements
with the natives.  And this led to trouble later on.

Meanwhile Sir George lost no time in settling his land in his own
way.  He at once sent out some colonists and Philip Carteret, a
cousin of his own, as Governor.

On a summer day in 1665 Philip Carteret landed.  He set up no
crosses, and made no prayers, but with a hoe over his shoulder he
marched at the head of his men, as a sign that he meant to live
and work among them.  A little way inland he chose a spot on which
to build his town and called it Elizabeth, in honour of Sir George
Carteret's Wife.

Things went well enough until the time came for rents to be paid.
Then many of the settlers, who had been there before Carteret
came, refused to pay.  For they said they had bought their land from
the Indians, and owed nothing to Sir George.  But as the Governor
insisted on his right they rose in rebellion.  They held a meeting
at Elizabethtown, deposed Philip Carteret, and chose James Carteret
a weak and bad son of Sir George, as their Governor.  Seeing nothing
else for it Philip went home and laid his case before Sir George and
the Duke.  They both supported him, so the rebels submitted, James
Carteret went off to New York, and Philip again became Governor of
New Jersey.

Meanwhile Lord Berkeley had grown tired of all the trouble, and
he sold his part of New Jersey to some Quakers.  So henceforth New
Jersey was divided into two, East Jersey and West Jersey, East
Jersey belonging to Carteret, West Jersey to the Quakers.

In 1680 Sir George Carteret died, and his part of New Jersey was
also sold to Quakers, one of whom was William Penn, afterwards to
become famous in American history.  Soon after this New Jersey fell
on very troublous times, of which it would take too long to tell.
But at length the two Jerseys were again made into one, and in the
time of Anne the colony became a Royal Province.  Then for thirty-six
years it was united to New York, but in 1738 was again divided and
has remained a separate state ever since.

Chapter 40 - The Founding of Pennsylvania




Like other persecuted people, the Quakers sought a refuge in America.
But even there they were not welcomed.  The Puritans of Massachusetts
who had fled from persecution, themselves turned persecutors as we
have seen.  The Quakers discovered that for them there was no Paradise
of Peace in the lands beyond the sea.  But when George Carteret
sold his part of New Jersey Quakers bought it, a young man named
William Penn being one of these Quakers.

This William Penn was the son of Sir William Penn, an admiral in
the British Navy, and a friend of King Charles I.  He was a Royalist
and a Churchman, and when his handsome young son turned Quaker he
was greatly grieved.  At first indeed he was so angry that he turned
young William out of the house.  Later, however, seeing that his
son was quite determined to be a Quaker, the Admiral forgave him,
and before he died he asked the Duke of York to be kind to him.
The Duke of York promised he would.  And then there began a strange
friendship between the Catholic Prince and the Quaker.

After the Quakers bought New Jersey a great many went there.  They
found not only a large amount of freedom, but a kindly government,
for William Penn framed the laws.

The Quaker colony of New Jersey was to a certain extent a success,
but there were troubles with neighbouring states, and troubles with
other claimants of the land.  So at length (exactly when we do not
know), the idea of founding a real Quaker colony came into Penn's
mind.

When Admiral Penn died the King owed him £16,000 and William Penn
inherited that claim.  So he asked the King to pay the debt not
in money but in land in America.  The extent of the land asked for
was exceedingly vague, but it was at least as big as the whole of
England.  Charles however was always in want of money.  So in 1681
he was pleased enough to give away this great tract of land, which
after all was his more by imagination than anything else, and get
rid of his debt; and acquire also the possibility of getting some
gold as well.  For in return for his land Penn agreed to pay two
beaver skins a year, and a fifth of all the gold or silver which
might be mined within his territory.

Charles not only gave Penn the land, but named it too.  Penn meant
to call his new country New Wales, but a Welshman who hated the
Quakers objected to the name of his land being given to a Quaker
colony, so Penn changed it to Sylvania, meaning Woodland, because
of the magnificent forests which were there.  But the King added
Penn to Sylvania thus calling it Penn's Woodlands.

William Penn, however, was afraid that people would think that this
was vanity on his part, and that he had called his province after
himself; so he tried to have the name changed.  He even bribed the
King's secretary to do it, but in vain.  As some one has said, if
he had bribed the King himself he might have succeeded better.  As
it was he did not succeed, for King Charles was very pleased with
the name.

"No," laughed the merry monarch, when Penn asked him to change it,
"we will keep the name, but you need not flatter yourself that it
is called after you.  It is so called after your gallant father."

So as the King insisted Penn had to submit, and he consoled himself
by thinking that as Penn means "hill" the name might be taken to
mean Wooded Hills.

The tract of land of which Penn now became possessed was smiling
and fertile and altogether desirable.  It had only one fault, and
that was that it had no sea coast.

In a new country where there were no roads, and where communication
inland was difficult that was a great drawback.  So Penn persuaded
the Duke of York to give him that part of his province on which the
Swedes had settled and which the Dutch had taken from the Swedes,
on the west shores of Delaware Bay.  Later this formed the State
of Delaware, but in the meantime it was governed as a part of
Pennsylvania.

Everything thus being settled, and the charter being granted, Penn
drew up a form of government for his colony, chose his cousin,
William Markham, as Governor, and sent him off in the autumn of
1681 with three shiploads of settlers.

With Markham, Penn sent a kindly letter to the Swedes of Delaware,
telling them that he was now their Governor. "I hope you will not
be troubled at the change," he said, "for you are now fixed at the
mercy of no Governor who comes to make his fortune.  You shall be
governed by laws of your own making, and live a free and, if you
will, a sober and industrious people.  I shall not usurp the right
of any, or oppress his person."

Penn also sent a letter to the Indians.

"There is a great God," he said, "that hath made the world and
all things therein, to Whom you, and I, and all people, owe their
being.  This great God hath written His law in our hearts, by which
we are taught and commanded to love and help, and do good to one
another.  Now this great God hath been pleased to make me concerned
in your part of the world, and the King of the country where I live
hath given me a great province therein.  But I desire to enjoy it
with your love and consent, that we may always live together as
neighbours, and friends, else what would the great God do to us?"

With this letter Penn sent presents to the Indian chiefs and told
them that he would soon come to see them himself, and make arrangements
about the land.

But it was not till the following year that Penn set out for his
colony.  When he landed the Dutch and Swedes greeted him with joy.
And to show that they acknowledged him as their Governor they
presented him, as in old feudal times, with a sod of earth, a bowl
of water, and a branch of a tree.  Penn then passed on to the spot
which he had chosen for his capital.  And as showing forth the spirit
in which his colony was founded, he called his city Philadelphia
or the city of brotherly love.

It was near this town that Penn met the Indian chiefs and made a
treaty with them as he had promised to do.  In the Indian language
the spot was called the Place of Kings, and had been used as a
meeting place by the surrounding tribes for long ages.  Here there
grew a splendid elm, a hoary giant of the forest which for a hundred
years and more had withstood the tempests.

Beneath the spreading branches of this tree Penn took his stand.
He was young and handsome, and although he wore the simple garb
of the Quakers he had not yet perhaps quite forgotten the "modish"
ways of his younger days, for about his waist he had knotted a pale
blue scarf.  Beside him stood his cousin, the deputy governor, and
a few more soberly clad Quakers.  In front of them, in a great half
circle were ranged the Indians, the old men in front, the middle-aged
behind, and last of all the young men.  They were gorgeous in paint
and feathers, and armed with hatchets, bows and arrows, but the
Quakers carried no weapons of any kind.

Greetings being over, an ancient warrior advanced, and amid deep
silence, tied a horn upon his forehead.  This was the sign of his
greatness, and also a sign that the spot was sacred.  Immediately
all the braves threw down their weapons, and seated themselves upon
the grass.  Then the old warrior announced that they were ready to
hear the words of the White Chief.

Then Penn spoke to the gathered Indians reminding them that the
Great Spirit wished all men to live in love and brotherhood, and
as the Redman listened his heart went out in love to this White
Chief who had friendship in his eyes, and kindliness in his voice.
And there under the spreading branches of the great elm tree they
swore to live in peace and brotherly love "as long as the rivers
shall run, and while the sun, moon and stars endure."

These Indians never broke their word and for the next seventy years
there was peace in Pennsylvania between the Redman and the White.

The Indians gave Penn the name of Onas which is the Algonquin
word for Feather.  Ever afterwards too they called the Governor of
Pennsylvania Onas, and whoever and whatever he was, for them he
was great and good.

But Penn was not only the great Chief Onas, he was also Father
Penn.  For he roamed the woods with the Indians, talking with them,
and sharing their simple food like one of themselves.  This greatly
delighted the Indians, and to show their pleasure they would perform
some of their wild dances.  Then up Penn would spring and dance with
the best of them.  So he won their hearts.  They loved him so much
that the highest praise they could give any man was to say "he is
like the great Onas," and it was said that any one dressed like a
Quaker was far safer among the Indians than one who carried a gun.

Life seemed so easy in Pennsylvania that in the first years thousands
of colonists came flocking to the new colony.  It grew faster than
any other colony, so fast indeed that houses could not be built
quickly enough.  So for a time many of the new settlers had to live
in caves dug out of the banks of the Delaware River.  It was in one
of these caves that the first baby citizen of the city of brotherly
love was born.

Pennsylvania prospered and grew fast, but there were constant troubles
with Lord Baltimore about the border line between his province and
Penn's.  The British Kings in those days gave land charters in the
most reckless fashion and over and over again the boundaries of
one province overlapped those of the others.  Then of course there
was trouble.  This had happened with Virginia and Maryland.  Now it
happened with Maryland and Pennsylvania.

The quarrel at length became so bad that Penn went home to England
to have the matter settled; after that for a time things were
better, but the quarrel was not really settled.  It was not settled
until many years after both Penn and Lord Baltimore were dead.
Then, in 1767, two English astronomers, Charles Mason and Jeremiah
Dixon, surveyed and fixed the boundary which ever since has been
known as the Mason and Dixon Line.  Every mile a small stone was
placed with B on one side and P on the other.  Along the eastern
part, too, every five miles a larger stone was placed with the
arms of Penn on one side and those of Baltimore on the other.  But
further west these were discontinued.  For in those days when there
were few roads it was difficult to get these heavy stones carried
to the proper places.

When Penn went back to England he had meant to return to his colony
very soon.  But fifteen years passed before be was able to do so.
During this time King Charles II, who had given him the charter for
his great Possessions, died, and his brother James, who as Duke of
York had been Penn's friend, was driven from the throne.  Then for
a time Penn's great province was taken from him, because he was
suspected of helping his old friend, the dethroned king.  The colony
was then placed under the control of the Governor of New York.

Two years later, however, Penn was cleared from the charge of
treason and his right to Pennsylvania was again recognised.  Then
once more he crossed the seas to visit his possessions in the New
World.

He found that in fifteen years great changes had been wrought.
The two or three thousand inhabitants had now increased to twenty
thousand.  Many of the new settlers were not Quakers but Protestants
from Germany, Holland and Sweden, and Presbyterians from Scotland
and Ireland.  Penn welcomed them all, but they on their side had
grown apart from him.  They were no longer his children.  He was no
longer Father Penn, but the Governor and proprietor.

From this Governor the settlers demanded greater liberties than they
had.  Penn was grieved, but he met the clamour in the most generous
spirit. "Friends," he said, "if in the constitution there be
anything that jars, alter it." So it was altered until practically
the colonists became a self-governing people.

Now for a second time Penn felt himself obliged to return to England.
He did not want to go, but longed to live out the rest of his life
in his colony which, in spite of all troubles and difficulties, be
loved dearly.

"I cannot think of such a voyage without great reluctance," he
said. "For I promised myself that I might stay so long, at least,
with you, as to render everybody entirely easy and safe.  For my
heart is among you, as well as my body, whatever some people may
please to think.  And no unkindness or disappointment shall ever be
able to alter my love to the country."

So with just a little soreness in his heart Penn sailed away never
to return.  At home trouble and misfortune awaited him.  And in
the midst of his troubles sickness fell upon him.  For six years a
helpless invalid with failing mind, he lingered on.  Then in 1718
he died.  He was seventy-four.  Only four years of his long life had
been spent in America.  Yet he left his stamp upon the continent
far more than any other man of his time.  He was the greatest, most
broad-minded of all the colony builders.  As he said himself he had
sailed against wind and tide all his life.  But the buffetings of
fortune left him sweet and true to the end.

Chapter 41 - How Benjamin Franklin Came to Philadelphia




After Penn left his colony there was frequent trouble between the
Governors and the people.  Some of the Governors were untrustworthy,
some were weak, none was truly great.  But about ten years after
Penn's death a truly great man came to Philadelphia.  This was
Benjamin Franklin.  Of all the men of colonial times Franklin was
the greatest.

Benjamin was the fifteenth child of his father, a sturdy English
Nonconformist who some years before had emigrated from Banbury
in England to Boston in America.  As the family was so large the
children had to begin early to earn their own living.  So at the
age of ten Benjamin was apprenticed to his own father, who was a
tallow chandler, and the little chap spent his days helping to make
soap and "dips" and generally making himself useful.

But he did not like it at all.  So after a time he was apprenticed
to his elder brother James, who had a printing press, and published
a little newspaper called the Courant.  Benjamin liked that much
better.  He soon became a good printer, he was able to get hold of
books easily, and he spent his spare time reading such books as the
"Pilgrim's Progress" and the "Spectator." Very soon too he took
to writing, and became anxious to have an article printed in his
brother's paper.

But as he was only a boy he was afraid that if his brother knew he
had written the article he would never print it.  So he disguised his
handwriting, and slipped his paper under the door of the printing
house at night.  It was found next morning, and to Benjamin's
delight was thought good enough to be printed in the paper.  After
that Benjamin wrote often for the little paper.  In time however he
and his brother began to quarrel, and when he was seventeen Benjamin
decided to go to New York to seek his fortune there.

He took ship to New York in 1723 and arrived there one October day
with very little money in his pocket and not a friend in the town.
He did not find work in New York, but an old printer advised him
to go to Philadelphia where he knew his son was in need of a printer.

Benjamin was already three hundred miles from home, and Philadelphia
was another hundred miles farther, but he resolved to go.

Fifty miles of the way he trudged on foot, the rest he went by
boat, and after nearly a week of most uncomfortable traveling he
arrived one Sunday morning at Philadelphia.  He was soaked to the
skin, dirty and untidy, hungry and tired.  His pockets bulged out
with shirts and stockings, but save for one Dutch dollar they were
empty of money.

Benjamin was tired and dirty, but before everything he was hungry;
so he went to a baker's shop and bought three big rolls.  As his
pockets were full he tucked two of the rolls under his arm and
strolled down the street devouring the third, while the clean tidy
folk all ready to go to meeting stared at him in wonder.

Such was the first entry of one of America's greatest statesmen into
the town which was henceforth to be his home and where he was to
become famous; and as a clever Frenchman said "invent the Republic."

In Philadelphia Benjamin found work, and although after a year he
left his new home and sailed for England, he soon returned.  In ten
years' time he was one of the fore most men of Philadelphia and took
an interest in everything which concerned the life of the people.
He established a circulating library; he was chosen Clerk of the
General Assembly; he was appointed postmaster; he established a
police force and fire brigade, and helped to found the University
of Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Hospital.

In fact he took an interest in everything connected with the welfare
of his adopted city, and of Pennsylvania.  And when troubles arose
with the British Government Franklin was chosen to go to England
to try to put matters right.  Later on other colonies too asked
for his help, and he went to England as the agent, not only of
Pennsylvania but of Massachusetts, New Jersey and Georgia.

He was a philosopher and scientist as well as a diplomatist, and
he was the first American whose fame spread all over the world.

Chapter 42 - The Founding of North and South Carolina




It was in the part of the United States which we now call North
Carolina, you remember, that Sir Walter Raleigh tried to found a
colony.  That colony came to nothing, and the land which the white
men had reclaimed from the wilderness returned once more to the
wilderness.

Nearly a hundred years went past before white men again appeared in
that part of the country.  In 1629 King Charles I granted all this
region to Sir Robert Heath, but he made no attempt to colonise it.
Then a few settlers from Virginia and New England and the Barbados,
finding the land vacant and neglected, settled there.

Meanwhile Charles II had come to the throne, and, wanting to
reward eight of his friends who had been staunch to him during the
Commonwealth, in 1663 he gave them all the land between latitude
30° and 36° and from sea to sea.  If you look on the map you will
see that this takes in nearly the whole of the Southern States.

Sir Robert Heath was by this time dead, and his heirs had done
nothing with his great territory in America, but as soon as it was
given to others they began to make a fuss.  Charles II, however,
said as Sir Robert had failed to plant a colony his claim no longer
held good.  So the eight new proprietors took possession of it.
This tract of land had already been named Carolina by the Frenchman
Ribaut in honour of Charles IX of France, and now the Englishmen
who took possession of it kept the old name in honour of Charles
II.

The Lords Proprietary then set about drawing up laws for their new
country.  After an old English title they called the oldest among
them the Palatine.  Palatine originally meant a person who held
some office about a king's palace.  It has come to mean one who has
royal privileges.  So a Prince Palatine is really a little king.
When the Palatine died it was arranged that the next in age should
