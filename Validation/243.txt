                O, happy bird, to drink from the pool,
                A bliss free to the million!

           This is the language of symbolism. When Venus went about to

           The mele now presented is of an entirely different character
           from those that have just preceded. It is said to have been
           the joint composition of the high chief Keiki-o-ewa of Kauai,
           at one time the kahu of Prince Moses, and of Kapihe, a
           distinguished poet--haku-mele--and prophet. (To Kapihe is
           ascribed the prophetic and oracular utterance, _E iho ana o
           luna, e pii ana o lalo; e ku ana ka paia; e moe ana kaula; e
           kau ana kau-huhu--o lani iluna, o honua ilalo_--"The high
           shall be brought low, the lowly uplifted; the defenses shall
           stand; the prophet shall lie low; the mountain walls shall
           abide--heaven above, earth beneath.")

           This next poem may be regarded as an epithalamium, the
           celebration of the mystery and bliss of the wedding night,
           the _hoao ana_ of a high chief and his high-born _kapu_
           sister. The murmur of the breeze, the fury of the winds, the
           heat of the sun, the sacrificial ovens, all are symbols that
           set forth the emotions, experiences, and mysteries of the
           night:

           to escape. There is special reference here to the famous
           conch known in Hawaiian story as _Kiha-pu_. It was credited
           with supernatural powers as a _kupua_. During the reign of
           Umi, son of Liloa, it was stolen from the _heiau_ in Waipio
           valley and came into the hands of god Kane. In his wild
           awa-drinking revels the god terrified Umi and his people by
           sounding nightly blasts with the conch. The shell was finally
           restored to King Umi by the superhuman aid of the famous dog

           Kama-lala-walu, and succeeded his father in the kingship over
           Maui and, probably, Lanai. Kama-lala-walu had a long and
           prosperous reign, which ended, however, in disaster. Acting
           on the erroneous reports of his son Kauhi, whom he had sent
           to spy out the land, he invaded the kingdom of
           Lono-i-ka-makahiki on Hawaii, was wounded and defeated in
           battle, taken prisoner, and offered up as a sacrifice on the
           altar of Lono's god, preferring that death, it is said, to
           the ignominy of release.]

           Hawaii--and he in turn by the famous warrior-king Kahekili,

           [Footnote 227: _I waihona kapuahi kanaka eha_. This verse
           presents grammatical difficulties. The word _I_ implies the

           probably not the intent. It seems to be a means, authorized
           by poetical license, of ascribing honor and tabu-glory to
           the name of the person eulogized, who, the context leads the
           author to think, was Kekaulike. The island names other than
           that of Maui seem to have been thrown in for poetical effect,
           as that king, in the opinion of the author, had no power over
           Kauai, Oahu, or Hawaii. The purpose may have been to assert
           that his glory reached to those islands.]

           often overhanging. Viewed from the ocean, the cliffs are
           piled one upon another like the buttresses of a Gothic
           cathedral. The ocean is often stormy, and during several
           months in the year forbids intercourse with other parts of
           the island, save as the hardy traveler makes his way along

           performed to the accompaniment of the ipu or calabash, and,
           being the only ones that were so accompanied, if the author
           is correctly informed, they may be classed together under one
           head as the calabash hulas.

PAHU HULA, HULA DRUM]

[Page 103]




                              XII.--THE HULA PAHU


           The hula _pahu_ was so named from the _pahu_,[236] or drum,
           that was its chief instrument of musical accompaniment (pl.
           x).

           [Footnote 236: Full form, _pahu-hula_.]

           It is not often that the story of an institution can be so
           closely fitted to the landmarks of history as in the case of
           this hula; and this comes about through our knowledge of the
           history of the pahu itself. Tradition, direct and reliable,
           informs us that the credit of introducing the big drum
           belongs to La'a. This chief flourished between five and six
           centuries ago, and from having spent most of his life in the
           lands to the south, which the ancient Hawaiians called
           Kahiki, was himself generally styled La'a-mai-Kahiki
           (La'a-from-Kahiki). The young man was of a volatile
           disposition, given to pleasure, and it is evident that the
           big drum he brought with him to Hawaii on one of his voyages
           from Kahiki was in his eyes by no means the least important
           piece of baggage that freighted his canoes. On nearing the
           land he waked the echoes with the stirring tones of his drum,
           which so astonished the people that they followed him from
           point to point along the coast and heaped favors upon him
           whenever he came ashore.

           La'a was an enthusiastic patron of the hula and is said to
           have made a tour of the islands, in which he instructed the
           natives in new forms of this seductive pastime, one of which
           was the hula _ka-eke_.

           There is reason to believe, it seems, that the original use
           of the pahu was in connection with the services of the
           temple, and that its adaptation to the halau was simply a
           transference from one to another religious use.

           The hula pahu was preeminently a performance of formal and
           dignified character, not such as would be extemporized for
           the amusement of an irreverent company. Like all the formal
           hulas, it was tabu, by which the Hawaiians meant that it was
           a religious service, or so closely associated with the notion
           of worship as to make it an irreverence to trifle with it.
           For this reason as well as for its intrinsic dignity its
           performance was reserved for the most distinguished guests
           and the most notable occasions.

           Both classes of actors took part in the performance of the
           hula pahu, the olapa contributing the mele as they stood and
           went through the motions of the dance, while the hoopaa
           maintained the kneeling position and operated the big drum
           with the left hand. While his left hand was thus engaged, the
[Page 104] musician with a thong held in his right hand struck a tiny
           drum, the _pu-niu_, that was conveniently strapped to the
           thigh of the same side. As its name signifies, the pu-niu was
           made from coconut shell, being headed with fish-skin.

           The harmonious and rhythmic timing of these two instruments
           called for strict attention on the part of the performer. The
           pahu, having a tone of lower pitch and greater volume than
           the other, was naturally sounded at longer intervals, while
           the pu-niu delivered its sharp crisp tones in closer order.

                Let Hilo turn here and turn there;
                Hilo's kept from employ, somber with rain;
            5   Pili-keko roars with full stream;
                The feathers of Hilo bristle with cold,
                And her hail-stones smite on the sand.
                She lies without motion, with upturned face,
                The fire-places pillowed with ashes;
           10   The bullets of rain are slapping the land,
                Pitiless rain turmoiling Pai-kaka.
                So, indeed.

                In Puna was I, in Ku-ki'i, in Ha'e-ha'e,
                I saw a wraith of lehua, a burning bush,
                A fire-tree beneath the lava plate.
                Magnificent Puna, fertile from rain,
            5   At all times weaving its mantle.
                Aye Puna's a land of splendor,
                Proudly bedight with palm and lehua;
                Beauteous above, but horrid below,
                And miry the plain of Mau-kele.
           10   Apua upturned, plod on to Mau-kele.

                Wai-aleale stands haughty and cold,
                Her lehua bloom, fog-soaked, droops pensive;
                The thorn-fringe set ahout swampy Ai-po is
                A feather that flaunts in spite of the pinching frost.
             5  Her herbage is pelted, stung by the rain;

                Bruised all her petals, and moaning in cold
                Mokihana's sun, his wat'ry beams.
                I have acted in good faith and honor,
                My complaint is only to you--
           10   A matter that touches my life.

                Best watch within and toward Ka-ula;
                Question each breeze, note every rumor,
                Even the whisper of Malua-kele.
                Search high and search low, unobservant.

           15   There is life in the breath from her body,
                Fond caress by a hand not inconstant.
                Like fissured groves of coral
                Stand the ragged clumps of lehua.
                Many the houses, easy the life.

           20   You have your portion--of love;
                Humanity smells at the door.
                Aye, indeed.

           The imagery of this poem is peculiarly obscure and the
           meaning difficult of translation. The allusions are so local
           and special that their meaning does not carry to a distance.

           Wai-aleale is the central mountain mass of Kauai, about 6,000
           feet high. Its summit, a cold, fog-swept wilderness of swamp
           and lake beset with dwarfish growths of lehua, is used as the
           symbol of a woman, impulsively kind, yet in turn passionate
           and disdainful. The physical attributes of the mountain are
           ascribed to her, its spells of frosty coldness, its gloom and
           distance, its fickleness of weather, the repellant
           hirsuteness of the stunted vegetation that fringes the
           central swamp--these things are described as symbols of her
           temper, character, and physical make-up. The bloom and
           herbage of the wilderness, much pelted by the storm, are
           figures to represent her physical charms. But spite of all
           these faults and imperfections, a perennial fragrance, as of
           mokihana, clings to her person, and she is the object of
           devoted love, capable of weaving the spell of fascination
           about her victims.

           This poem furnishes a good example of a peculiarity that
           often is an obstacle to the understanding of Hawaiian poetry.
           It is the breaking up of the composition into a number of
           parts that have but a loose seeming connection the one with
           the other.

ULI-ULI, A GOURD RATTLE]

[Page 107]




                              XIII.--THE HULA ULI-ULI


           The hula _uli-uli_ was so called from the rattle which was
           its sole instrument of accompaniment. This consisted of a
           small gourd about the size of a large orange, into the cavity
           of which were put shot-like seeds, like those of the canna; a
           handle was then attached (pl. xi).

           The actors who took part in this hula belonged, it is said,
           to the class termed hoopaa, and went through with the
           performance while kneeling or squatting, as has been
           described. While cantillating the mele they held the rattle,
           _uli-uli_, in the right hand, shaking it against the palm of
           the other hand or the thigh, or making excursions in one
           direction and another. In some performances of this hula
           which the author has witnessed the olapa also took part, in
           one case a woman, who stood and cantillated the song with
           movement and gesture, while the hoopaa devoted themselves
           exclusively to handling the uli-uli rattles.

           The sacrificial offerings that preceded the old-time
           performances of this hula are said to have been awa and a
           roast porkling, in honor of the goddess Laka.

           If the dignity and quality of the meles now used, or reported
           to have been used, in the hula _uli-uli_ are to be taken as
           any criterion of the quality and dignity of this hula, one
           has to conclude that it must be assigned to a rank below that
           of some others, such, for instance, as the _ala'a-papa_,
           _pa-ipu_, _Pele_, and others.

           David Malo, the Hawaiian historian, author of _Ka Moolelo
           Hawaii_,[246] in the short chapter that he devotes to the hula,
           mentions only ten hulas by name, the _ka-laau_,
           _pa'i-umauma_, _pahu_, _pahu'a_, _ala'a-papa_, _pa'i-pa'i_,
           _pa-ipu_, _ulili_, _kolani_, and the _kielei_. _Ulili_ is but
           another form of the word _uli-uli_. Any utterance of Malo is
           to be received seriously; but it seems doubtful if he
           deliberately selected for mention the ten hulas that were
           really the most important. It seems more probable that he set
           down the first ten that stood forth prominent in his memory.
           It was not Malo's habit, nor part of his education, to make
           an exhaustive list of sports and games, or in fact of
           anything. He spoke of what occurred to him. It must also be
           remembered that, being an ardent convert to Christianity,
[Page 108] Malo felt himself conscience-bound to set himself in
           opposition to the amusements, sports, and games of his
           people, and he was unable, apparently, to see in them any
           good whatsoever. Malo was a man of uncompromising honesty and
           rigidity of principles. His nature, acting under the new
           influences that surrounded him after the introduction of
           Christianity, made it impossible for him to discriminate
           calmly between the good and the pernicious, between the
           purely human and poetic and the depraved elements in the
           sports practised by his people during their period of
           heathenism. There was nothing halfway about Malo. Having
           abandoned a system, his nature compelled him to denounce it
