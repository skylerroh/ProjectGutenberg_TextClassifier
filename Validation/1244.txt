Transcriber's Note.

There are significant differences in the numerous reprints of
Isaac Watts' "Hymns and Spiritual Songs." The first generation
of this Project Gutenberg file was from an 1818 printing by C.
Corrall of 38 Charing Cross, London.

The "Index" and the "Table of the Scriptures that are Turned into
Verse" are retained, and can be found at the end of the text. The
"Table to find any Hymn by the first Line," however, has been
omitted for the following reasons:
1. It refers to page numbers that are here expunged; and
2. In this electronic version first lines can be easily
located via searches.

There are 3 books of hymns, and numbers have been added to indicate
in which of these the hymns are placed. For example, "2:38" refers
to "Book 2, Hymn Number 38," and so on.

Throughout, modern numerals have been substituted for their Roman
equivalents.



Preface.

The following extracts from the Doctor's preface contain the
substance of his plan in the three different parts into which the
Hymns are divided; the whole would have exceeded the limits of a
small book.

"Far be it from my thoughts to lay aside the Book of Psalms in
public worship; few can pretend so great a value for them as
myself: it is the most noble, most devotional and divine collection
of poesy; and nothing can be supposed more proper to raise a pious
soul to heaven than some parts of that book; never was a piece of
experimental divinity so nobly written, and so justly reverenced
and admired. But it must be acknowledged still, that there are a
thousand lines in it which were not made for a church in our days
to assume as its own. There are also many deficiencies of light
and glory which our Lord Jesus and his apostles have supplied in
the writings of the New Testament: and with this advantage I have
composed these Spiritual Songs, which are now presented to the
World. Nor is the attempt vainglorious or presuming; for in respect
of clear evangelical knowledge, 'The least in the kingdom of heaven
is greater than all the Jewish Prophets.' Matt. xi. 11.

"Now let me give a short account of the following composures.

"The greatest part of them are suited to the general state of the
gospel, and the most common affairs of Christians: I hope there
will be very few found but what may properly be used in a religious
assembly, and not one of them but may well be adapted to some
seasons either of private or public worship. The most frequent
tempers and changes of our spirit, and conditions of our life,
are here copied, and the breathings of our piety expressed according
to the variety of our passions, our love, our fear, our hope, our
desire, our sorrow, our wonder and our joy, as they are refined
into devotion, and act under the influence and conduct of the
blessed Spirit; all conversing with God the Father 'by the new
and living Way' of access to the throne, even the person and the
mediation of our Lord Jesus Christ. To him also, even 'to the Lamb
that was slain and now lives,' I have addressed many a song; for
thus doth the holy Scripture instruct and teach us to worship in
the various patterns of Christian psalmody described in the
Revelation.

"I have aimed at ease of numbers, and smoothness of sound, and
endeavoured to make the sense plain and obvious. If the verse
appears so gentle and flowing as to incur the censure of feebleness,
I may honestly affirm, that sometimes it cost me labour to make
it so.

"In the first part I have borrowed the sense and much of the form
of the song from some particular portions of scripture, and have
paraphrased most of the doxologies in the New Testament, that
contain any thing in them peculiarly evangelical: and many parts
of the Old Testament also, that have a reference to the times of
the Messiah.

"The second part consists of hymns whose form is mere human
composure; but I hope the sense and materials will always appear
divine. I might have brought some text or other, and applied it
to the margin of every verse, if this method had been as useful
as it was easy. If there be any poems in the book that are capable
of giving delight to persons of a more refined taste and polite
education, perhaps they may be found in this part; but except they
lay aside the humour of criticism, and enter into a devout frame,
every ode here already despairs of pleasing.

"I have prepared the third part only for the celebration of the
Lord's Supper, that, in imitation of our blessed Saviour, we may
sing an hymn after we have partaken of the Bread and Wine."



Hymns.


Book 1.
Collected from the Holy
Scriptures.


Hymn 1:1.
A new song to the Lamb that was slain.
Rev. 5. 6 8 9 10 12.

1 Behold the glories of the Lamb
Amidst his Father's throne
Prepare new honours for his name,
And songs before unknown.

2 Let elders worship at his feet,
The church adore around,
With vials full of odours sweet,
And harps of sweeter sound.

3 Those are the prayers of the saints,
And these the hymns they raise:
Jesus is kind to our complaints,
He loves to hear our praise.

4 [Eternal Father, who shall look
Into thy secret will?
Who but the Son shall take that book
And open every seal?

5 He shall fulfil thy great decrees,
The Son deserves it well;
Lo, in his hand the sovereign keys
Of heaven, and death, and hell!]

6 Now to the Lamb that once was slain
Be endless blessings paid;
Salvation, glory, joy remain
For ever on thy head.

7 Thou hast redeem'd our souls with blood,
Hast set the pris'ners free,
Hast made us kings and priests to God,
And we shall reign with thee.

8 The worlds of nature and of grace
Are put beneath thy power;
Then shorten these delaying days,
And bring the promis'd hour.


Hymn 1:2.
The deity and humanity of Christ, John 1. 1-3 14.
Col. 9. 16. Eph. 3, 9 10.

1 Ere the blue heavens were stretch'd abroad,
From everlasting was the Word;
With God he was; the Word was God,
And must divinely be ador'd.

2 By his own power were all things made;
By him supported all things stand;
He is the whole creation's head,
And angels fly at his command.

3 Ere sin was born, or Satan fell,
He led the host of morning stars;
(Thy generation who can tell,
Or count the number of thy years?)

4 But lo, he leaves those heavenly forms,
The Word descends and dwells in clay,
That he may hold converse with worms,
Dress'd in such feeble flesh as they.

5 Mortals with joy beheld his face,
Th' eternal Father's only Son;
How full of truth! how full of grace!
When thro' his eyes the Godhead shone!

6 Archangels leave their high abode
To learn new mysteries here, and tell
The loves of our descending God,
The glories of Imannuel.


Hymn 1:3.
The nativity of Christ, Luke 1. 30 &c. Luke 2, 10 &c.

1 Behold, the grace appears,
The promise is fulfill'd;
Mary the wondrous virgin bears,
And Jesus is the child.

2 [The Lord, the highest God,
Calls him his only Son;
He bids him rule the lands abroad,
And gives, him David's throne.

3 O'er Jacob shall he reign
With a peculiar sway;
The nations shall his grace obtain,
His kingdom ne'er decay.]

4 To bring the glorious news
A heavenly form appears;
He tells the shepherds of their joys,
And banishes their fears.

5 "Go, humble swains," said he,
"To David's city fly;
"The promis'd infant born to-day,
"Doth in a manger lie.

6 "With looks and heart serene,
"Go visit Christ your King;"
And straight, a flaming troop was seen;
The shepherds heard them sing:

7 "Glory to God on high,
"And heavenly peace on earth,
"Good-will to men, to angels joy,
"At the Redeemer's birth!"

8 [In worship so divine
Let saints employ their tongues,
With the celestial host we join,
And loud repeat their songs:

9 "Glory to God on high,
"And heavenly peace on earth,
"Good-will to men, to angels joy,
"At our Redeemer's Birth."]


Hymn 1:4. [Supplement]
The inward witness to Christianity, 1 John 5. 10.

1 Questions and doubts be heard no more;
Let Christ and joy be all our theme;
His Spirit seals his gospel sure,
To every soul that trusts in him.

2 Jesus, thy witness speaks within:
The mercy which thy words reveal
Refines the heart from sense and sin,
And stamps its own celestial seal.

3 'Tis God's inimitable hand
That moulds and forms the heart anew;
Blasphemers can no more withstand,
But bow and own thy doctrine true.

4 The guilty wretch that trusts thy blood,
Finds peace and pardon at thy cross;
The sinful soul averse to God,
Believes and loves his Maker's laws.

5 Learning and wit may cease their strife,
When miracles with glory shine;
The voice that calls the dead to life
Must be almighty, and divine.


Hymn 1:5.
Submission to afflictive providences, Job 1. 21.

1 Naked as from the earth we came,
And crept to life at first,
We to the earth return again,
And mingle with our dust.

2 The dear delights we here enjoy,
And fondly call our own,
Are but short favours borrow'd now,
To be repaid anon.

3 'Tis God that lifts our comforts high,
Or sinks them in the grave;
He gives, and (blessed be his name!)
He takes but what he gave.

4 Peace, all our angry passions, then,
Let each rebellious sigh
Be silent at his sov'reign will,
And every murmur die.

5 If smiling mercy crown our lives,
Its praises shall be spread;
And we'll adore the justice too
That strikes our comforts dead.


Hymn 1:6.
Triumph over death, Job 19. 25-27.

1 Great God, I own thy sentence just
And nature must decay;
I yield my body to the dust
To dwell with fellow-clay.

2 Yet faith may triumph o'er the grave,
And trample on the tombs:
My Jesus, my Redeemer lives,
My God, my Saviour comes.

3 The mighty Conqueror shall appear
High on a royal seat,
And Death, the last of all his foes,
Lie vanquish'd at his feet.

4 Tho' greedy worms devour my skin,
And gnaw my wasting flesh,
When God shall build my bones again,
He clothes them all afresh.

5 Then shall I see thy lovely face
With strong immortal eyes,
And feast upon thy unknown grace
With pleasure and surprise.


Hymn 1:7.
The invitation of the gospel; or, Spiritual
food and clothing, Isa. 55. 1 &c.

1 Let every mortal ear attend,
And every heart rejoice,
The trumpet of the gospel sounds
With an inviting voice.

2 Ho, all ye hungry starving souls,
That feed upon the wind,
And vainly strive with earthly toys
To fill an empty mind,

3 Eternal wisdom has prepar'd
A soul reviving feast,
And bids your longing appetites
The rich provision taste.

4 Ho, ye that pant for living streams,
And pine away and die,
Here you may quench your raging thirst
With springs that never dry.

5 Rivers of love and mercy here
In a rich ocean join;
Salvation in abundance flows,
Like floods of milk and wine.

6 [Ye perishing and naked poor,
Who work with mighty pain
To weave a garment of your own
That will not hide your sin,

7 Come naked, and adorn your souls
In robes prepar'd by God,
Wrought by the labours of his Son,
And dy'd in his own blood.]

8 Dear God, the treasures of thy love
Are everlasting mines,
Deep as our helpless miseries are,
And boundless as our sins.

9 The happy gates of gospel grace
Stand open night and day,
Lord, we are come to seek supplies,
And drive our wants away.


Hymn 1:8.
The safety and protection of the church, Isa. 26. 1-6.

1 How honourable is the place
Where we adoring stand,
Zion the glory of the earth,
And beauty of the land!

2 Bulwarks of mighty grace defend
The city where we dwell,
The walls of strong salvation made,
Defy th' assaults of hell.

3 Lift up the everlasting gates,
The doors wide open fling,
Enter, ye nations, that obey
The statutes of our King.

4 Here you shall taste unmingled joys,
And live in perfect peace,
You that have known Jehovah's name,
And ventur'd on his grace.

5 Trust in the Lord, for ever trust,
And banish all your fears;
Strength in the Lord Jehovah dwells,
Eternal as his years.

6 [What tho' the rebels dwell on high,
His arm shall bring them low,
Low' as the caverns of the grave
Their lofty heads shall bow.]

7 [On Babylon our feet shall tread
In that rejoicing hour,
The ruins of her walls shall spread
A pavement for the poor.]
