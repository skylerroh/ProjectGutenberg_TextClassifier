                           GODS OF THE NORTH

                          By ROBERT E. HOWARD


    [Transcriber's Note: Originally published in March 1934 in "The
    Fantasy Fan". This etext was prepared from the reprint in Fantastic
    Universe December 1956. Extensive research did not uncover any
    evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]

     Publisher's Note: _The publication of this strange story by Robert
     E. Howard, author of the Conan stories, so much a part of the
     Living Library of Fantasy, represents a departure for this
     magazine. Without abandoning our policy of bringing you, month
     after month, the best in NEW Science Fiction and Fantasy, we will,
     from time to time, publish material such as this, hitherto known to
     only a few students of the field! GODS OF THE NORTH was published
     in 1934, in Charles D. Hornig's THE FANTASY FAN, which had a
     circulation of under a hundred! We thank Sam Moskowitz, Editor and
     SF historian, who showed us this story._

was hushed; silence lay on the red-stained snow. The pale bleak sun that
glittered so blindingly from the ice-fields and the snow-covered plains
struck sheens of silver from rent corselet and broken blade, where the
dead lay in heaps. The nerveless hand yet gripped the broken hilt:
helmeted heads, back-drawn in the death throes, tilted red beards and
golden beards grimly upward, as if in last invocation to Ymir the
frost-giant.

Across the red drifts and mail-clad forms, two figures approached one
another. In that utter desolation only they moved. The frosty sky was
over them, the white illimitable plain around them, the dead men at
their feet. Slowly through the corpses they came, as ghosts might come
