voice grew rapidly nearer, ascending from the river, but when we
expected to see him emerge, it ceased entirely. We had called up some
straggling Indian--the first we had met, although for two days back
we had seen tracks--who, mistaking us for his fellows, had been only
undeceived by getting close up. It would have been pleasant to witness
his astonishment; he would not have been more frightened had some of the
old mountain spirits they are so much afraid of suddenly appeared in his
path. Ignorant of the character of these people, we had now additional
cause of uneasiness in regard to Mr. Preuss; he had no arms with him,
and we began to think his chance doubtful. Occasionally we met deer, but
had not the necessary time for hunting. At one of these orchard grounds,
we encamped about noon to make an effort for Mr. Preuss. One man took
his way along a spur leading into the river, in hope to cross his
trail, and another took our own back. Both were volunteers; and to the
successful man was promised a pair of pistols--not as a reward, but as
a token of gratitude for a service which would free us all from much
anxiety."

At the end of four days, Mr. Preuss surprised and delighted his friends
by walking into camp. He had lived on roots and acorns and was in the
last stages of exhaustion.

Shortly the advance party reached Sutter's Fort where they received the
most hospitable treatment. All their wants were abundantly supplied, and
provisions were sent back to Fitzpatrick and his party.



CHAPTER XXV.


 The Start Homeward--The Visitors in Camp and Their Story--Carson and
 Godey Start to the Rescue--Trailing the Enemy by Night--In Camp--The
 Attack--An Amazing Success--The Return.

Fremont and his command remained at Sutter's Fort about a month, when
their preparations were completed for their return to the States. They
journeyed leisurely up the valley of the San Joaquin, crossing over the
Sierra Nevada and Coast Range by means of an easily travelled pass. The
latter chain was followed until they came upon the Spanish trail, along
which they passed to the Mohave River. Where the Trail diverges from
that stream, Carson became involved in a characteristic adventure.

While in camp two Mexicans, a man and a boy, rode up and told a sad
story. They belonged to a party of Mexican traders from New Mexico. Six
of them, including two women who acted as cooks, were left in charge
of a band of horses while the rest were away, engaged in barter. When
endeavoring to find better grazing for their animals and while the man
and boy were on guard, they were attacked by a band of thirty Indians.
The warriors were after the horses and their first demonstration was
a flight of arrows. The only chance of escape was to make off with
the animals and the two started them on a dead run straight toward
the Indians. The charge was so impetuous, that they forced their way
through, and continued their flight, while the warriors remained behind
to massacre the others.

When the couple had gone a long distance, they left the horses and
turned back to look for their friends. While they were doing so, they
came upon Fremont's camp. When it is added that among those who were
left behind by the Mexicans, were the wife of the man and the father and
mother of the boy, their pitiful situation must touch the hearts of
all. They were overcome with grief, and Carson was so stirred that he
volunteered to go back with the couple and help rescue their friends
if alive, or punish the Indians, if it should prove that they had been
massacred.

Richard Godey, a mountaineer almost the equal with Carson, willingly
agreed to accompany him. The two were perfectly familiar with the
country, which was an immense advantage. When the Mexicans described the
spring, a long ways distant, where they had abandoned the horses to
hunt for their friends, Carson recalled its exact location. It was about
thirty miles away and he said that that was the point toward which they
must push with all speed.

Accordingly they turned the heads of their horses thither and struck
into a sweeping gallop, resting only when compelled to do so, and
reaching the spring at daylight the next morning. Not a horse was
visible, but an examination of the ground showed that the Indians had
followed the fleeing Mexicans and stock to the spring, where, finding
the animals, they had captured and driven them off in another direction.

It seems like a piece of madness for three men to pursue ten times as
many Indian warriors; but the blood of Carson was up and he told Godey
it was too soon for them to turn back. The eyes of both flashed, when
they reflected upon the shameful outrage, and they meant that the
marauders should not get off scot free.

As the boy was only an incumbrance, he was left behind, and, taking
the trail of the warriors, the three put their horses to their best,
confident the chase would be a long one. On such occasions, the red men
are accustomed to travel a long distance before making a halt. With so
much booty in their hands, they were liable to be set upon by others as
savage as themselves, and they had every cause, therefore, to get out of
the country with the least possible delay.

The three were riding in this furious fashion, when most unexpectedly
the steed of the Mexican gave out. A minute's examination showed he was
as thoroughly used up and useless as the horse of the Ute Indian, years
before, who started out with Kit to pursue the thief that was running
off with the animals. There was no course but to leave the Mexican
behind, for time was too precious to ride back to camp after another
horse. He, therefore was told to go back to Fremont's camp and await
their return.

The exploit of Carson and Godey, when calmly told, seems incredible.
There was no one in Fremont's command who would go with them, and though
they knew there were a score and a half of savage wild men to encounter,
they did not hesitate, but pressed their steeds to the utmost, eager to
join in the fierce hand to hand conflict.

When night shut in upon them, the Indians were not in sight and the
signs indicated they were a good many miles ahead. There was no moon
or stars and they could see only a few feet in advance of their horses'
ears, but it would not do to linger. If they should go into camp, they
would lose so much ground that pursuit was likely to be hopeless.

Accordingly, they dismounted and leading their steeds, continued
the pursuit on foot. Where it was impossible to see the ground, they
depended on the sense of feeling. Quite certain of the general direction
taken by the red men, they occasionally stooped down and passed their
hands over the earth. The trail was so distinct that it could be readily
detected in this manner, provided they had not gone astray. Several
times they wandered to the right or left, but found their way back
without difficulty, and the chase was continued for several hours in
this singular fashion.

After a time, the trail became so fresh that it could be readily
detected and no doubt was left in their minds that they were close upon
the marauders. Inasmuch as Carson and Godey had pushed their horses to
the utmost, and they were showing signs of weariness, they concluded, in
view of these facts, to halt and wait until daylight.

The night was unusually cold, but they dared not start a fire, lest
it should apprise their enemies of their presence. So they suffered in
silence, miserable, wretched and as uncomfortable as it was possible to
be, while watching for the growing light in the east.

When at last, morning appeared, they were so chilled that they could
hardly walk; but making their way to the bottom of a ravine, they
kindled a fire, and with the help of some violent exercise, managed to
start their blood in circulation.

In a very brief time, their horses were resaddled and they were
galloping along the trail again. Within an hour, they caught sight of
the Indians and the stolen animals. The warriors were in camp and were
enjoying a breakfast of horse meat, several of the stock having been
killed to furnish the food.

Before the Indians could detect their pursuers, the latter dismounted
and hid their steeds where they were not likely to attract notice. They
then started to crawl in among the stolen animals, which were grazing a
short distance from camp. This was an exceedingly delicate task, for
the horses were likely to give the alarm, even if the warriors did not
detect their presence; but patience and skill succeeded, and, after a
time, they were among the drove.

But the very thing they dreaded took place. They had scarcely reached
the animals, when one of them became frightened by the appearance of the
strangers, and began rearing and snorting. This caused such confusion
among the others that the Indians became alarmed and sprang to their
feet. Carson and Godey emitted a series of yells that must have made the
red men envious, and dashed at full speed toward the thirty Indians. The
moment they were within range, both fired. Carson killed his man, but
Godey missed. The latter reloaded with great quickness and fired again,
bringing down his man.

Meanwhile, the warriors were thrown into a sort of panic by the
amazing audacity of their assailants. They could not have suspected the
truth--that is that no others were near. They must have believed that a
strong reserve was close at hand and that if they tarried in camp they
would be overwhelmed by a party of avengers. Accordingly they broke and
ran, leaving the daring mountaineers masters of the field.

In accordance with the savage spirit of the border, Godey scalped the
two Indians who had been shot, after which the horses were gathered
together and driven to where the steeds of the mountaineers had been
left.

But when this point was reached, Carson expressed himself as not
satisfied: they had not ascertained the fate of the captives and they
now proceeded to do so.

In the camp of the Mexicans were found the mangled bodies of the two
men. These were buried by Carson and Godey who made search for the
women. Though nothing of them was discovered, it was afterwards learned
that they, too, had been killed. Having done all that was possible,
Carson and Godey made their way back to Fremont's camp, where the
stolen property was turned over to the Mexicans, the daring mountaineers
refusing to accept the slightest payment for their extraordinary
services.



CHAPTER XXVI.


 Arrival at Bent's Fort--Carson goes to Taos and Decides to Become a
 Farmer--Arrival of a Messenger from Fremont--Carson and Owens Repair
 Again to Bent's Fort--Carson Engages as Guide for Fremont's Third
 Exploring Expedition--On the Great Divide--Division of the Parties--The
 Journey Across the Desert--A Singular Meeting--Aboriginal Horse Thieves.

After a tedious journey of many miles, the exploring party reached
Bent's Fort July 2, 1844. The labors were considered finished, and
bidding his old commander goodbye, Carson made his way to Taos, where he
had a most happy reunion with his family. He was cordially welcomed by
hundreds of old friends who had learned years before the rare courage
and worth of the man, and who were proud to possess such a neighbor.

Carson had led a wild and adventurous career, and, after talking much
with those in whom he had confidence, he decided to adopt the life of
a farmer. In this conclusion he was joined by Richard Owens, an old
mountaineer and an intimate associate for many years.

It did not take them long to fix upon a desirable site, and, in the
spring of 1845, stock and animals were bought, building commenced
and everything was fairly under way. At the moment when the scarred
mountaineers were counting with pleasure on the complete arrangements
made, an express messenger galloped up and handed Carson a letter.

The contents were of an important character. Captain Fremont had written
to notify Kit that he had started on his third exploring expedition,
and, inasmuch as the mountaineer had given his promise months before,
that in the event of doing so, he (Carson) would serve again as guide,
Fremont reminded him that he should hold him to his pledge and would
expect to meet him at Bent's Fort on his arrival there.

It was a considerable pecuniary sacrifice for Carson to keep his
promise, but he never failed to do so, when it was not absolutely
impossible. Besides, it is fair to presume that the old life could never
lose its charm for one of his disposition, and, contrasted with the
humdrum existence of a farmer, he could not have been much grieved over
the reception of the message. But it must be stated that both Owens and
Carson sold out at much loss, and, putting their affairs in the best
shape possible, bade families and friends goodbye, mounted their horses
and set out for Bent's Fort which was safely reached some days later.

There they were warmly welcomed by Fremont, who had entered upon his
third exploring expedition, the last under the authority of the United
States government, though two others were afterwards undertaken on his
own responsibility. As was to be supposed, Fremont taking lessons from
his previous experiences, was much better equipped for his third than
for either of the other preceding expeditions. He had about fifty men,
among them in addition to Carson and Owens, being Maxwell, the famous
mountaineer, Walker who was a member of Captain Bonneville's expedition
to the Columbia, besides other hunters and scouts less known but not
less skilful and daring than they.

We have already given tolerably full accounts of the two exploring
expeditions of Fremont, and it is not our purpose to narrate the
particulars of the one which followed. There is a sameness in many of
the occurrences but the third time the Pathfinder penetrated into the
recesses of the far west, he became involved in a series of experiences
totally different from the preceding and deeply interesting of
themselves.

Several months were spent on what may be called the Great Divide--that
is the region where the waters flow east or west to either ocean, and
in the autumn of the year they encamped on the southwestern shore of the
Great Salt Lake.

Before them stretched a vast arid plain to which the trappers referred
with a shudder of terror. They had heard of it many a time and the
common legend was that no man white or Indian who had ever attempted to
cross it, succeeded. These stories, however, added to the eagerness of
Captain Fremont to explore its secrets, and, when he proposed it to
his men, they expressed as strong a desire as he to do so. They felt a
mutual trust and confidence impossible under other circumstances.

Some seventy miles away, a mountain peak held out the promise of wood
and water. Four men under the guidance of an Indian, were sent forward
to explore the place, and, in the event of finding water, they were
instructed to apprise the watchful commander by means of the smoke from
a camp fire.

When the second day closed without sight of the signal, Fremont became
so uneasy that he moved forward with the rest of the party and travelled
all night. At daylight, one of the smaller party approached them. He
said that running water and grass existed at the mountains, but their
Indian guide was wholly ignorant of the country. This was good news and
the next day the party reached the stream.

Shortly after, the expedition was divided into two parties, Walker (of
whom mention has been made), taking charge of the larger while Fremont
led the smaller. It was the purpose of Walker to pass around to the
foot of the Sierra Nevada, by a route with which he was familiar, while
Fremont with Carson and less than a dozen men, among whom were several
Delaware Indians, headed straight across the desert.

While advancing over this arid tract, they detected a volume of smoke
rising from a ravine. Cautiously approaching, they discovered an Indian
warrior perfectly nude, standing by a fire and watching an earthen pot
in which something was simmering. He was greatly frightened and offered
them his food. They smiled, treated him kindly and gave him several
trifling presents which he received with childish delight.

One of the singular incidents of the journey took place while the
exploring party were making their way along the foot of the Sierras.
Passing around a point on the lake shore, they unexpectedly met a dozen
Indian warriors. They were walking directly behind each other in what is
known as Indian file, their heads bent forward and their eyes fixed on
the ground. The whites turned aside to allow them to pass and naturally
watched them with much interest. The Indians neither halted, deviated
from the path, spoke nor looked up, but walked straight forward with
their silent, measured tread until they disappeared. The explorers did
not interfere with them or speak to them. Thus the representatives of
the different races encountered.

The division under charge of Walker joined Fremont at the appointed
rendezvous, but winter was upon them, the mountains were sure to be
choked with snow and no one was familiar with the route. As a matter of
prudence, therefore, Walker was directed to continue southward with the
principal party, while Fremont and a few picked men pushed on directly
through the Sierras to Sutter's Fort, with a view of obtaining the
necessary animals and supplies.

The smaller division was advancing as best it could, when a number of
plainly marked trails were observed showing they were in the vicinity of
some of the most notorious horse thieves in the world. They were daring
and skilful, went long distances, plundered ranches and hastened to the
mountains with their booty. The exasperated Californians often organized
and went in pursuit, but it was rare they overtook the dusky thieves,
and when they succeeded in doing so, were invariably defeated.

This sort of people were undesirable neighbors, and Fremont sent forward
two Delawares and two mountaineers to make an investigation. They
had not gone far, when the company following them found the signs so
threatening that they were alarmed for the scouts. A short distance
further they came upon such an excellent camping site that they decided
to halt for the night.
