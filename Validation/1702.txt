lost and in their place new ones had grown in just the few months
of spring and summer.

But Peter didn't blame Lightfoot in the least, because he had
told Peter that he didn't like to tell things to people who
wouldn't believe what he told them when Peter had asked him about
the rags hanging to his antlers. "I'm trying to believe it," he
said, quite humbly.

"It's all true," broke in another voice.

Peter jumped and turned to find his big cousin, Jumper the
Hare.  Unseen and unheard, he had stolen up and had overheard what
Peter and Lightfoot had said.

"How do you know it is true?" snapped Peter a little crossly, for
Jumper had startled him.

"Because I saw Lightfoot's old antlers after they had fallen off,
and I often saw Lightfoot while his new ones were growing,"
retorted Jumper.

"All right!  I'll believe anything that Lightfoot tells me if you
say it is true," declared Peter, who greatly admires his cousin,
Jumper.  "Now tell me about those rags, Lightfoot.  Please do."

Lightfoot couldn't resist that "please."  "Those rags are what is
left of a kind of covering which protected the antlers while they
were growing, as I told you before," said he.  "Very soon after
my old ones dropped off the new ones began to grow.  They were
not hard, not at all like they are now.  They were soft and very
tender, and the blood ran through them just as it does through
our bodies.  They were covered with a sort of skin with hairs on
it like thin fur.  The ends were not sharply pointed they now
are, but were big and rounded, like knobs.  They were not like
antlers at all, and they made my head hot and were very
uncomfortable.  That is why I hid away.  They grew very fast, so
fast that every day I could see by looking at my reflection in
water that they were a little longer.  It seemed to me sometimes
as if all my strength went into those new antlers. And I had to
be very careful not to hit them against anything.  In the first
place it would have hurt, and in the second place it might have
spoiled the shape of them.

"When they had grown to the length you now see, they began to
shrink and grow hard.  The knobs on the ends shrank until they
became pointed.  As soon as they stopped growing the blood stopped
flowing up in them, and as they became hard they were no longer
tender.  The skin which had covered them grew dry and split, and I
rubbed it off on trees and bushes.  The little rags you see are
what is left, but I will soon be rid of those.  Then I shall be
ready to fight if need be and will fear no one save man, and will
fear him only when he has a terrible gun with him."

Lightfoot tossed his head proudly and rattled his wonderful
antlers against the nearest tree.  "Isn't he handsome," whispered
Peter to Jumper the Hare; "and did you ever hear of anything so
wonderful as the growing of those new antlers in such a short
time?  It is hard to believe, but I suppose it must be true."

"It is," replied Jumper, "and I tell you, Peter, I would hate to
have Lightfoot try those antlers on me, even though I were big as
a man.  You've always thought of Lightfoot as timid and afraid,
but you should see him when he is angry.  Few people care to face
him then."




CHAPTER IV: The Spirit Of Fear

   When the days grow cold and the nights are clear,
   There stalks abroad the spirit of fear.
       --Lightfoot the Deer.


It is sad but true.  Autumn is often called the sad time of the
year, and it is the sad time.  But it shouldn't be.  Old Mother
Nature never intended that it should be.  She meant it to be the
GLAD time.  It is the time when all the little people of the
Green Forest and the Green Meadows have got over the cares and
worries of bringing up families and teaching their children how
to look out for themselves.  It is the season when food is
plentiful, and every one is fat and is, or ought to be, care
free.  It is the season when Old Mother Nature intended all her
little people to be happy, to have nothing to worry them for the
little time before the coming of cold weather and the hard times
which cold weather always brings.

But instead of this, a grim, dark figure goes stalking over the
Green Meadows and through the Green Forest, and it is called the
Spirit of Fear.  It peers into every hiding-place and wherever it
finds one of the little people it sends little cold chills over
him, little chills which jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun cannot
chase away, though he shine his brightest.  All night as well as
all day the Spirit of Fear searches out the little people of the
Green Meadows and the Green Forest.  It will not let them sleep.
It will not let them eat in peace.  It drives them to seek
new hiding-places and then drives them out of those.  It keeps
them ever ready to fly or run at the slightest sound.

Peter Rabbit was thinking of this as he sat at the edge of the
dear Old Briar-patch, looking over to the Green Forest.  The Green
Forest was no longer just green; it was of many colors, for Old
Mother Nature had set Jack Frost to painting the leaves of the
maple-trees and the beech-trees, and the birch-trees and the
poplar-trees and the chestnut-trees, and he had done his work well.
Very, very lovely were the reds and yellows and browns against
the dark green of the pines and the spruces and the hemlocks.
The Purple Hills were more softly purple than at any other season
of the year.  It was all very, very beautiful.

But Peter had no thought for the beauty of it all, for the Spirit
of Fear had visited even the dear Old Briar-patch, and Peter was
afraid.  It wasn't fear of Reddy Fox, or Redtail the Hawk, or
Hooty the Owl, or Old Man Coyote.  They were forever trying to
catch him, but they did not strike terror to his heart because he
felt quite smart enough to keep out of their clutches.  To be
sure, they gave him sudden frights sometimes, when they happened
to surprise him, but these frights lasted only until he reached
the nearest bramble-tangle or hollow log where they could not get
at him.  But the fear that chilled his heart now never left him
even for a moment.

And Peter knew that this same fear was clutching at the hearts of
Bob White, hiding in the brown stubble; of Mrs. Grouse, squatting
in the thickest bramble-tangle in the Green Forest; of Uncle
Billy Possum and Bobby Coon in their hollow trees; of Jerry
Muskrat in the Smiling Pool; of Happy Jack Squirrel, hiding in
the tree tops; of Lightfoot the Deer, lying in the closest
thicket he could find.  It was even clutching at the hearts of
Granny and Reddy Fox and of great, big Buster Bear.  It seemed to
Peter that no one was so big or so small that this terrible
Spirit of Fear had not searched him out.

Far in the distance sounded a sudden bang.  Peter jumped and
shivered.  He knew that every one else who had heard that bang
had jumped and shivered just as he had.  It was the season of
hunters with terrible guns.  It was man who had sent this
terrible Spirit of Fear to chill the hearts of the little meadow
and forest people at this very time when Old Mother Nature had
made all things so beautiful and had intended that they should
be happiest and most free from care and worry.  It was man who
had made the autumn a sad time instead of a glad time, the very
saddest time of all the year, when Old Mother Nature had done
her best to make it the most beautiful.

"I don't understand these men creatures," said Peter to little
Mrs. Peter, as they stared fearfully out from the dear Old
Briar-patch.  "They seem to find pleasure, actually find pleasure,
in trying to kill us.  I don't understand them at all.  They
haven't any hearts.  That must be the reason; they haven't any
hearts."




CHAPTER V: Sammy Jay Brings Lightfoot Word


Sammy Jay is one of those who believe in the wisdom of the old
saying, "Early to bed and early to rise."  Sammy needs no alarm
clock to get up early in the morning.  He is awake as soon as it
is light enough to see and wastes no time wishing he could sleep
a little longer.  His stomach wouldn't let him if he wanted
to.  Sammy always wakes up hungry.  In this he is no different
from all his feathered neighbors.

So the minute Sammy gets his eyes open he makes his toilet, for
Sammy is very neat, and starts out to hunt for his breakfast.
Long ago Sammy discovered that there is no safer time of day to
visit the dooryards of those two-legged creatures called men than
very early in the morning.  On this particular morning he had
planned to fly over to Farmer Brown's dooryard, but at the last
minute he changed his mind.  Instead, he flew over to the
dooryard of another farm.  It was so very early in the morning
that Sammy didn't expect to find anybody stirring, so you can
guess how surprised he was when, just as he came in sight of that
dooryard, he saw the door of the house open and a man step out.

Sammy stopped on the top of the nearest tree.  "Now what is that
man doing up as early as this?" muttered Sammy.  Then he caught
sight of something under the man's arm.  He didn't have to look
twice to know what it was.  It was a gun!  Yes, sir, it was a gun,
a terrible gun.

"Ha!" exclaimed Sammy, and quite forgot that his stomach was
empty.  "Now who can that fellow be after so early in the morning?
I wonder if he is going to the dear Old Briar-patch to look for
Peter Rabbit, or if he is going to the Old Pasture in search of
Reddy Fox, or if it is Mr. and Mrs. Grouse he hopes to kill.
I think I'll sit right here and watch."

So Sammy sat in the top of the tree and watched the hunter with
the terrible gun.  He saw him head straight for the Green Forest.
"It's Mr. and Mrs. Grouse after all, I guess," thought Sammy.
"If I knew just where they were I'd go over and warn them."
But Sammy didn't know just where they were and he knew that it
might take him a long time to find them, so he once more began to
think of breakfast and then, right then, another thought popped
into his head.  He thought of Lightfoot the Deer.

Sammy watched the hunter enter the Green Forest, then he silently
followed him.  From the way the hunter moved, Sammy decided that
he wasn't thinking of Mr. and Mrs. Grouse.  "It's Lightfoot the
Deer, sure as I live," muttered Sammy.  "He ought to be warned.
He certainly ought to be warned.  I know right where he is.
I believe I'll warn him myself."

Sammy found Lightfoot right where he had expected to.  "He's
coming!"  cried Sammy. "A hunter with a terrible gun is coming!"




CHAPTER VI: A Game Of Hide And Seek


There was a game of hide and seek that Danny Meadow Mouse once
played with Buster Bear.  It was a very dreadful game for Danny.
But hard as it was for Danny, it didn't begin to be as hard
as the game Lightfoot the Deer was playing with the hunter
in the Green Forest.

In the case of Buster Bear and Danny, the latter had simply to
keep out of reach of Buster.  As long as Buster didn't get his
great paws on Danny, the latter was safe.  Then, too, Danny is a
very small person.  He is so small that he can hide under two or
three leaves.  Wherever he is, he is pretty sure to find a
hiding-place of some sort.  His small size gives him advantages in
a game of hide and seek.  It certainly does.  But Lightfoot the
Deer is big.  He is one of the largest of the people who live in
the Green Forest.  Being so big, it is not easy to hide.

Moreover, a hunter with a terrible gun does not have to get close
in order to kill.  Lightfoot knew all this as he waited for the
coming of the hunter of whom Sammy Jay had warned him.  He had
learned many lessons in the hunting season of the year before and
he remembered every one of them.  He knew that to forget even one
of them might cost him his life.  So, standing motionless behind a
tangle of fallen trees, Lightfoot listened and watched.

Presently over in the distance he heard Sammy Jay screaming,
"Thief, thief, thief!"  A little sigh of relief escaped
Lightfoot.  He knew that that screaming of Sammy Jay's was a
warning to tell him where the hunter was.  Knowing just where the
hunter was made it easier for Lightfoot to know what to do.

A Merry Little Breeze came stealing through the Green Forest.
It came from behind Lightfoot and danced on towards the hunter with
the terrible gun.  Instantly Lightfoot began to steal softly away
through the Green Forest.  He took the greatest care to make no
sound.  He went in a half-circle, stopping every few steps to
listen and test the air with his wonderful nose.  Can you guess
what Lightfoot was trying to do?  He was trying to get behind the
hunter so that the Merry Little Breezes would bring to him the
dreaded man-scent.  So long as Lightfoot could get that scent, he
would know where the hunter was, though he could neither see nor
hear him.  If he had remained where Sammy Jay had found him, the
hunter might have come within shooting distance before Lightfoot
could have located him.

So the hunter with the terrible gun walked noiselessly through
the Green Forest, stepping with the greatest care to avoid
snapping a stick underfoot, searching with keen eye every thicket
and likely hiding-place for a glimpse of Lightfoot, and studying
the ground for traces to show that Lightfoot had been there.




CHAPTER VII: The Merry Little Breezes Help Lightfoot


Could you have seen the hunter with the terrible gun and Lightfoot
the Deer that morning on which the hunting season opened you might
have thought that Lightfoot was hunting the hunter instead of the
hunter hunting Lightfoot.  You see, Lightfoot was behind the hunter
instead of in front of him. He was following the hunter, so as to
keep track of him. As long as he knew just where the hunter was, he
felt reasonably safe.
