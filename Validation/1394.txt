THE LANI PEOPLE


By J. F. Bone




CHAPTER I

The boxed ad in the opportunities section of the Kardon Journal of
Allied Medical Sciences stood out like a cut diamond in a handful
of gravel. "Wanted," it read, "Veterinarian--for residency in active
livestock operation. Single recent graduate preferred. Quarters and
service furnished. Well-equipped hospital. Five-year contract, renewal
option, starting salary 15,000 cr./annum with periodic increases. State
age, school, marital status, and enclose recent tri-di with application.
Address Box V-9, this journal."

Jac Kennon read the box a second time. There must be a catch to it.
Nothing that paid a salary that large could possibly be on the level.
Fifteen thousand a year was top pay even on Beta, and an offer like this
for a new graduate was unheard of--unless Kardon was in the middle of an
inflation. But Kardon wasn't. The planet's financial status was A-1.
He knew. He'd checked that immediately after landing. Whatever might
be wrong with Kardon, it wasn't her currency. The rate of exchange was
1.2-1 Betan.

A five-year contract--hmm--that would be seventy-five thousand. Figure
three thousand a year for living expenses, that would leave sixty-plenty
of capital to start a clinic. The banks couldn't turn him down if he had
that much cash collateral.

Kennon chuckled wryly. He'd better get the job before he started
spending the money he didn't have. He had 231 credits plus a few
halves, tenths, and hundredths, a diploma in veterinary medicine, some
textbooks, a few instruments, and a first-class spaceman's ticket. By
watching his expenses he had enough money to live here for a month and
if nothing came of his efforts to find a job on this planet, there was
always his spaceman's ticket and another world.

Another world! There were over six thousand planets in the Brotherhood
of Man. At two months per planet, not figuring transit time, it would
take more than a thousand Galactic Standard years to visit them all, and
a man could look forward to scarcely more than five hundred at best. The
habitat of Man had become too large. There wasn't time to explore every
possibility.

But a man could have certain standards, and look until he found a
position that fitted. The trouble was--if the standards were too high
the jobs were too scarce. Despite the chronic shortage of veterinarians
throughout the Brotherhood, there was a peculiar reluctance on the part
of established practitioners to welcome recent graduates. Most of the
ads in the professional journals read "State salary desired," which was
nothing more than economic blackmail--a bald-faced attempt to get as
much for as little as possible. Kennon grimaced wryly. He'd be damned if
he'd sell his training for six thousand a year. Slave labor, that's what
it was. There were a dozen ads like that in the Journal. Well, he'd give
them a trial, but he'd ask eight thousand and full GEA benefits. Eight
years of school and two more as an intern were worth at least that.

He pulled the portable voicewrite to a comfortable position in front of
the view wall and began composing another of the series of letters that
had begun months ago in time and parsecs away in space. His voice was a
fluid counterpoint to the soft hum of the machine.

And as he dictated, his eyes took in the vista through the view
wall. Albertsville was a nice town, too young for slums, too new for
overpopulation. The white buildings were the color of winter butter in
the warm yellow sunlight as the city drowsed in the noonday heat. It
nestled snugly in the center of a bowl-shaped valley whose surrounding
forest clad hills gave mute confirmation to the fact that Kardon
was still primitive, an unsettled world that had not yet reached the
explosive stage of population growth that presaged maturity. But that
was no disadvantage. In fact, Kennon liked it. Living could be fun on a
planet like this.

It was abysmally crude compared to Beta, but the Brotherhood had opened
Kardon less than five hundred years ago, and in such a short time one
couldn't expect all the comforts of civilization.

It required a high population density to supply them, and while Kardon
was integrated its population was scarcely more than two hundred
million. It would be some time yet before this world would achieve a
Class I status. However, a Class II planet had some advantages. What it
lacked in conveniences it made up in opportunities and elbow room.

A normal Betan would have despised this world, but Kennon wasn't normal,
although to the casual eye he was a typical representative of the
Medico-Technological Civilization, long legged, fair haired, and short
bodied with the typical Betan squint that left his eyes mere slits
behind thick lashes and heavy brows. The difference was internal rather
than external.

Possibly it was due to the fact that his father was the commander of a
Shortliner and most of his formative years had been spent in space. To
Kennon, accustomed to the timeless horror of hyper space, all planets
were good, broad open places where a man could breathe unfiltered air
and look for miles across distances unbroken by dually bulk heads and
safety shields. On a planet there were spaciousness and freedom and
after the claustrophobic confinement of a hyper ship any world was
paradise. Kennon sighed, finished his letters, and placed them in the
mail chute. Perhaps, this time, there would be a favorable reply.



CHAPTER II

Kennon was startled by the speed with which his letters were answered.
Accustomed to the slower pace of Beta he had expected a week would
elapse before the first reply, but within twenty-four hours nine of his
twelve inquiries were returned. Five expressed the expected "Thank you
but I feel that your asking salary is a bit high in view of your lack
of experience." Three were frankly interested and requested a personal
interview. And the last was the letter, outstanding in its quietly
ostentatious folder-the reply from Box V-9.

"Would Dr. Kennon call at 10 A.M. tomorrow at the offices of
Outworld Enterprises Incorporated and bring this letter and suitable
identifications?" Kennon chuckled. Would he? There was no question about
it. The address, 200 Central Avenue, was only a few blocks away. In
fact, he could see the building from his window, a tall functional block
of durilium and plastic, soaring above the others on the street, the
sunlight gleaming off its clean square lines. He eyed it curiously,
wondering what he would find inside.

* * *

The receptionist took his I.D. and the letter, scanned them briefly,
and slipped them into one of the message tubes beside her desk. "It will
only be a moment, Doctor," she said impersonally. "Would you care to sit
down? '"

"Thank you," he said. The minute, reflected, could easily be an hour. But
she was right. It was only a minute until the message tube clicked
and popped a capsule onto the girl's desk. She opened it, and removed
Kennon's I.D. and a small yellow plastic rectangle. Her eyes widened at
the sight of the plastic card.

"Here you are, Doctor. Take shaft number one. Slip the card into the
scanner slot and you'll be taken to the correct floor. The offices you
want will be at the end of the corridor to the left. You'll find any
other data you may need on the card in case you get lost." She looked at
him with a curious mixture of surprise and respect as she handed him the
contents of the message tube.

Kennon murmured an acknowledgment, took the card and his I.D., and
entered the grav-shaft. There was the usual moment of heaviness as
the shaft whisked him upward and deposited him in front of a thickly
carpeted corridor.

Executive level, Kennon thought as he followed the receptionist's
directions. No wonder she had looked respectful. But what was he doing
here? The employment of a veterinarian wasn't important enough to demand
the attention of a senior executive. The personnel section could handle
the details of his application as well as not. He shrugged. Perhaps
veterinarians were more important on Kardon. He didn't know a thing
about this world's customs.

He opened the unmarked door at the end of the corridor, entered a small
reception room, smiled uncertainly at the woman behind the desk, and
received an answering smile in return.

Come right in, Dr. Kennon. Mr. Alexander is waiting for you.

Alexander! The entrepreneur himself! Why? Numb with surprise Kennon
watched the woman open the intercom on her desk.

"Sir, Dr. Kennon is here," she said.

"Bring him in," a smooth voice replied from the speaker. Alexander X. M.
Alexander, President of Outworld Enterprises--a lean, dark, wolfish man
in his early sixties--eyed Kennon with a flat predatory intentness that
was oddly disquieting. His stare combined the analytical inspection
of the pathologist, the probing curiosity of the psychiatrist, and the
weighing appraisal of the butcher. Kennon's thoughts about Alexander's
youth vanished that instant. Those eyes belonged to a leader on the
battlefield of galactic business.

Kennon felt the conditioned respect for authority surge through him in
a smothering wave. Grimly he fought it down, knowing it was a sign of
weakness that would do him no good in the interview which lay ahead.

"So you're Kennon," Alexander said. His lingua franca was clean and
accentless. "I expected someone older."

"Frankly, sir, so did I," Kennon replied.

Alexander smiled, an oddly pleasant smile that transformed the hard
straight lines in his face into friendly curves. "Business, Dr. Kennon,
is not the sole property of age."

"Nor is a veterinary degree," Kennon replied.

"True. But one thinks of a Betan as someone ancient and sedate."

"Ours is an old planet--but we still have new generations."

"A fact most of us outsiders find hard to believe," Alexander said. "I
picture your world as an ironclad society crystallized by age and custom
into something rigid and in flexible."

"You would be wrong to do so," Kennon said. "Even though we are cultural
introverts there is plenty of dynamism within our society."

"How is it that you happen to be out here on the edge of civilization?"

"I never said I was like my society," Kennon grinned. "Actually I
suppose I'm one of the proverbial bad apples."

"There's more to it than that," Alexander said. "Your early years
probably influenced you."

Kennon looked sharply at the entrepreneur. How much did the man really
know about him? "I suppose so," he said indifferently.

Alexander looked pleased. "But even with your childhood experiences
there must be an atavistic streak in you--a throwback to your
adventurous Earth forebears who settled your world?"

Kennon shrugged. "Perhaps you're right. I really don't know. Actually,
I've never thought about it. It merely seemed to me that an undeveloped
world offered more opportunity."

"It does," Alexander said. "But it also offers more work. If you're
figuring that you can get along on the minimum physical effort required
on the Central Worlds, you have a shock coming."

"I'm not that innocent," Kennon said. "But I am not so stupid that I
can't apply modifications of Betan techniques to worlds as new as this."

Alexander chuckled. "I like you," he said suddenly. "Here read this and
see if you'd care to work for me." He picked a contract form from one of
the piles of paper on his desk and handed it to Kennon. "This is one
of our standard work contracts. Take it back to your hotel and check it
over. I'll expect to see you at this time tomorrow."

"Why waste time?" Kennon said. "The rapid-reading technique originated
on Beta. I can tell you in fifteen minutes."

"Hmm. Certainly. Read it here if you wish. I like to get things
settled--the sooner the better. Sit down, young man and read. You can
rouse me when you're finished." He turned his attention to the papers on
his desk and within seconds was completely oblivious of Kennon, his face
set in the rapt trancelike expression of a trained rapid reader.

Kennon watched for a moment as sheets of paper passed through
Alexander's hands to be added to the pile at the opposite end of the
desk. The man would do better, he thought, if he would have his staff
transcribe the papers to microfilm that could be read through an
interval-timed scanner. He might suggest that later. As for now, he
shrugged and seated himself in the chair beside the desk. The quiet was
broken only by the rustle of paper as the two rapt-faced men turned page
after page with mechanical regularity.

Finally Kennon turned the last page, paused, blinked, and performed
the necessary mental gymnastics to orient his time sense. Alexander, he
noticed, was still engrossed, sunk in his autohypnotic trance. Kennon
waited until he had finished the legal folder which he was reading and
then gently intruded upon Alexander's concentration.

Alexander looked up blankly and then went through the same mental
gyrations Kennon had performed a few minutes before. His eyes focused
and became hard and alert.

"Well?" he asked. "What do you think of it?"

"I think it's the damnedest, trickiest, most unilateral piece of
legalistics I've ever seen," Kennon said bluntly. "If that's the best
you can offer, I wouldn't touch the job with a pair of forceps."

Alexander smiled. "I see you read the fine print," he said. There was
quiet amusement in his voice. "So you don't like the contract?"

"No sensible man would. I'm damned if I'll sign commitment papers just
to get a job. No wonder you're having trouble getting professional help.
If your contracts are all like that it's' a wonder anyone works for
you."

"We have no complaints from our employees," Alexander said stiffly.

"How could you? If they signed that contract you'd have a perfect right
to muzzle them."

"There are other applicants for this post," Alexander said.

"Then get one of them. I wouldn't be interested."

"A spaceman's ticket is a good thing to have," Alexander said idly.
"It's a useful ace in the hole. Besides, you have had three other job
offers--all of which are good even though they don't pay fifteen Ems a
year."

Kennon did a quick double take. Alexander's investigative staff was
better than good. It was uncanny.

"But seriously, Dr. Kennon, I am pleased that you do not like that
contract. Frankly, I wouldn't consider employing you if you did."

"Sir?"

"That contract is a screen. It weeds out the careless, the fools, and
the unfit in one operation. A man who would sign a thing like that
has no place in my organization." Alexander chuckled at Kennon's blank
expression. "I see you have had no experience with screening contracts."

"I haven't," Kennon admitted. "On Beta the tests are formal. The
Medico-Psych Division supervises them."

"Different worlds, different methods," Alexander observed. "But they're
all directed toward the same goal. Here we aren't so civilized. We
depend more on personal judgment." He took another contract from one of
the drawers of his desk. "Take a look at this. I think you'll be more
satisfied."

"If you don't mind, I'll read it now," Kennon said.

Alexander nodded.

* * *

"It's fair enough," Kennon said, "except for Article Twelve."

"The personal privilege section?

"Yes."

"Well, that's the contract. You can take it or leave it."

"I'll leave it," Kennon said. "Thank you for your time." He rose to his
feet, smiled at Alexander, and turned to the door. "Don't bother to call
your receptionist," he said. "I can find my way out."

"Just a minute, Doctor," Alexander said. He was standing behind the
desk, holding out his hand.

"Another test?" Kennon inquired.

Alexander nodded. "The critical one," he said. "Do you want the job?"

"Of course."

"Without knowing more about it?"

"The contract is adequate. It defines my duties."

"And you think you can handle them?"

"I know I can."

"I notice," Alexander observed, "that you didn't object to other
provisions."

"No, sir. They're pretty rigid, but for the salary you are paying I
figure you should have some rights. Certainly you have the right to
protect your interests. But that Article Twelve is a direct violation of
everything a human being should hold sacred besides being a violation
of the Peeper Laws. I'd never sign a contract that didn't carry a full
Peeper rider."

"That's quite a bit."

"That's the minimum," Kennon corrected. "Naturally, I won't object
to mnemonic erasure of matters pertaining to your business once my
contract's completed and I leave your employment. But until then there
will be no conditioning, no erasures, no taps, no snoopers, and no
checkups other than the regular periodic psychans. I'll consult with you
on vacation time and will arrange it to suit your convenience. I'll even
agree to emergency recall, but that's the limit." Kennon's voice was
flat.

"You realize I'm agreeing to give you a great deal of personal liberty,"
Alexander said. "How can I protect myself?"

"I'll sign a contingency rider," Kennon said, "if you will specify
precisely what security matters I am not to reveal."

"I accept," Alexander said. "Consider yourself hired." He touched
