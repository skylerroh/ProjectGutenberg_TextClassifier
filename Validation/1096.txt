the other girls wanted to know her and couldn't, the old house was a
charming place to visit, the lads were considered fine fellows, and
the Campbells "are one of our first families," mamma said. So Ariadne
concealed her vexation at Rose's coolness, and changed the subject as
fast as possible.

"Studying French, I see; who is your teacher?" she asked, flitting over
the leaves of "Paul and Virginia," that lay on the table.

"I don't study it, for I read French as well as English, and uncle and
I often speak it for hours. He talks like a native, and says I have a
remarkably good accent."

Rose really could not help this small display of superiority, for French
was one of her strong points, and she was vain of it, though she usually
managed to hide this weakness. She felt that Ariadne would be the better
for a little crushing, and could not resist the temptation to patronise
in her turn.

"Oh, indeed!" said Miss Blish, rather blankly, for French was not her
strong point by any means.

"I am to go abroad with uncle in a year or two, and he knows how
important it is to understand the languages. Half the girls who leave
school can't speak decent French, and when they go abroad they are
so mortified. I shall be very glad to help you, if you like, for, of
course, you have no one to talk with at home."

Now Ariadne, though she looked like a wax doll, had feelings within her
instead of sawdust, and these feelings were hurt by Rose's lofty tone.
She thought her more "stuck up" than ever, but did not know how to bring
her down, yet longed to do it, for she felt as if she had received a
box on the ear, and involuntarily put her hand up to it. The touch of an
ear-ring consoled her, and suggested a way of returning tit for tat in a
telling manner.

"Thank you, dear; I don't need any help, for our teacher is from Paris,
and of course he speaks better French than your uncle." Then she added,
with a gesture of her head that set the little bells on her ears to
tingling: "How do you like my new ear-rings? Papa gave them to me last
week, and everyone says they are lovely."

Rose came down from her high horse with a rapidity that was comical,
for Ariadne had the upper hand now. Rose adored pretty things, longed
to wear them, and the desire of her girlish soul was to have her ears
bored, only Dr. Alec thought it foolish, so she never had done it. She
would gladly have given all the French she could jabber for a pair of
golden bells with pearl-tipped tongues, like those Ariadne wore; and,
clasping her hands, she answered, in a tone that went to the hearer's
heart,

"They are too sweet for anything! If uncle would only let me wear some,
I should be perfectly happy."

"I wouldn't mind what he says. Papa laughed at me at first, but he likes
them now, and says I shall have diamond solitaires when I am eighteen,"
said Ariadne, quite satisfied with her shot.

"I've got a pair now that were mamma's, and a beautiful little pair of
pearl and turquoise ones, that I am dying to wear," sighed Rose.

"Then do it. I'll pierce your ears, and you must wear a bit of silk in
them till they are well; your curls will hide them nicely; then, some
day, slip in your smallest ear-rings, and see if your uncle don't like
them."

"I asked him if it wouldn't do my eyes good once when they were red, and
he only laughed. People do cure weak eyes that way, don't they?"

"Yes, indeed, and yours are sort of red. Let me see. Yes, I really think
you ought to do it before they get worse," said Ariadne, peering into
the large clear eye offered for inspection.

"Does it hurt much?" asked Rose, wavering.

"Oh dear, no; just a prick and a pull, and it's all over. I've done
lots of ears, and know just how. Come, push up your hair and get a big
needle."

"I don't quite like to do it without asking uncle's leave," faltered
Rose, when all was ready for the operation.

"Did he ever forbid it?" demanded Ariadne, hovering over her prey like a
vampire.

"No, never!"

"Then do it, unless you are afraid," cried Miss Blish, bent on
accomplishing the deed.

That last word settled the matter, and, closing her eyes, Rose said
"Punch!" in the tone of one giving the fatal order "Fire!"

Ariadne punched, and the victim bore it in heroic silence, though she
turned pale and her eyes were full of tears of anguish.

"There! Now pull the bits of silk often, and cold-cream your ears every
night, and you'll soon be ready for the rings," said Ariadne, well
pleased with her job, for the girl who spoke French with "a fine accent"
lay flat upon the sofa, looking as exhausted as if she had had both ears
cut off.

"It does hurt dreadfully, and I know uncle won't like it," sighed Rose,
as remorse began to gnaw. "Promise not to tell, or I shall be teased
to death," she added, anxiously, entirely forgetting the two little
pitchers gifted with eyes as well as ears, who had been watching the
whole performance from afar.

"Never. Mercy me, what's that?" and Ariadne started as a sudden sound of
steps and voices came up from below.

"It's the boys! Hide the needle. Do my ears show? Don't breathe a word!"
whispered Rose, scrambling about to conceal all traces of their iniquity
from the sharp eyes of the Clan.

Up they came, all in good order, laden with the proceeds of a nutting
expedition, for they always reported to Rose and paid tribute to their
queen in the handsomest manner.

"How many, and how big! We'll have a grand roasting frolic after tea,
won't we?" said Rose, plunging both hands into a bag of glossy brown
nuts, while the Clan "stood at ease" and nodded to Ariadne.

"That lot was picked especially for you, Rosy. I got every one myself,
and they are extra whackers," said Mac, presenting a bushel or so.

"You should have seen Giglamps when he was after them. He pitched out
of the tree, and would have broken his blessed old neck if Arch had
not caught him," observed Steve, as he lounged gracefully in the window
seat.

"You needn't talk, Dandy, when you didn't know a chestnut from a beech,
and kept on thrashing till I told you of it," retorted Mac, festooning
himself over the back of the sofa, being a privileged boy.

"I don't make mistakes when I thrash you, old Worm, so you'd better mind
what you are about," answered Steve, without a ray of proper respect for
his elder brother.

"It is getting dark, and I must go, or mamma will be alarmed," said
Ariadne, rising in sudden haste, though she hoped to be asked to remain
to the nut-party.

No one invited her; and all the while she was putting on her things and
chatting to Rose the boys were telegraphing to one another the sad fact
that someone ought to escort the young lady home. Not a boy felt heroic
enough to cast himself into the breach, however; even polite Archie
shirked the duty, saying to Charlie, as they quietly slipped into an
adjoining room,

"I'm not going to do all the gallivanting. Let Steve take that chit home
and show his manners."

"I'll be hanged if I do!" answered Prince, who disliked Miss Blish
because she tried to be coquettish with him.

"Then I will," and, to the dismay of both recreant lads, Dr. Alec walked
out of the room to offer his services to the "chit."

He was too late, however, for Mac, obeying a look from Rose, had already
made a victim of himself, and trudged meekly away, wishing the gentle
Ariadne at the bottom of the Red Sea.

"Then I will take this lady down to tea, as the other one has found a
gentleman to go home with her. I see the lamps are lighted below, and I
smell a smell which tells me that auntie has something extra nice for us
to-night."

As he spoke, Dr. Alec was preparing to carry Rose downstairs as usual;
but Archie and Prince rushed forward, begging with penitent eagerness
for the honour of carrying her in an arm-chair. Rose consented, fearing
that her uncle's keen eye would discover the fatal bits of silk; so the
boys crossed hands, and, taking a good grip of each curly pate, she was
borne down in state, while the others followed by way of the banisters.

Tea was ordered earlier than usual, so that Jamie and his dolly could
have a taste, at least, of the holiday fun, for they were to stay till
seven, and be allowed twelve roasted chestnuts apiece, which they were
under bonds not to eat till next day.

Tea was despatched rapidly, therefore, and the party gathered round the
wide hearth in the dining-room, where the nuts were soon dancing gaily
on hot shovels or bouncing out among the company, thereby causing
delightful panics among the little ones.

"Come, Rosy, tell us a story while we work, for you can't help much,
and must amuse us as your share," proposed Mac, who sat in the shade
pricking nuts, and who knew by experience what a capital little
Scheherazade his cousin was.

"Yes, we poor monkeys can't burn our paws for nothing, so tell away,
Pussy," added Charlie, as he threw several hot nuts into her lap and
shook his fingers afterwards.

"Well, I happen to have a little story with a moral to it in my mind,
and I will tell it, though it is intended for younger children than
you," answered Rose, who was rather fond of telling instructive tales.

"Fire away," said Geordie, and she obeyed, little thinking what a
disastrous story it would prove to herself.

"Well, once upon a time, a little girl went to see a young lady who was
very fond of her. Now, the young lady happened to be lame, and had
to have her foot bandaged up every day; so she kept a basketful of
bandages, all nicely rolled and ready. The little girl liked to play
with this basket, and one day, when she thought no one saw her, she took
one of the rolls without asking leave, and put it in her pocket."

Here Pokey, who had been peering lovingly down at the five warm nuts
that lay at the bottom of her tiny pocket, suddenly looked up and said,
"Oh!" in a startled tone, as if the moral tale had become intensely
interesting all at once.

Rose heard and saw the innocent betrayal of the small sinner, and went
on in a most impressive manner, while the boys nudged one another and
winked as they caught the joke.

"But an eye did see this naughty little girl, and whose eye do you think
it was?"

"Eye of Dod," murmured conscience-stricken Pokey, spreading two chubby
little hands before the round face, which they were not half big enough
to hide.

Rose was rather taken aback by this reply, but, feeling that she was
producing a good effect, she added seriously,

"Yes, God saw her, and so did the young lady, but she did not say
anything; she waited to see what the little girl would do about it. She
had been very happy before she took the bandage, but when it was in her
pocket she seemed troubled, and pretty soon stopped playing, and sat
down in a corner looking very sober. She thought a few minutes, and then
went and put back the roll very softly, and her face cleared up, and
she was a happy child again. The young lady was glad to see that, and
wondered what made the little girl put it back."

"Tonscience p'icked her," murmured a contrite voice from behind the
small hands pressed tightly over Pokey's red face.

"And why did she take it, do you suppose?" asked Rose, in a
school-marmish tone, feeling that all the listeners were interested in
her tale and its unexpected application.

"It was so nice and wound, and she wanted it deffly," answered the
little voice.

"Well, I'm glad she had such a good conscience. The moral is that people
who steal don't enjoy what they take, and are not happy till they put
it back. What makes that little girl hide her face?" asked Rose, as she
concluded.

"Me's so 'shamed of Pokey," sobbed the small culprit, quite overcome by
remorse and confusion at this awful disclosure.

"Come, Rose, it's too bad to tell her little tricks before everyone,
and preach at her in that way; you wouldn't like it yourself," began Dr.
Alec, taking the weeper on his knee and administering consolation in the
shape of kisses and nuts.

Before Rose could express her regret, Jamie, who had been reddening
and ruffling like a little turkey-cock for several minutes, burst out
indignantly, bent on avenging the wound given to his beloved dolly.

"I know something bad that you did, and I'm going to tell right out. You
thought we didn't see you, but we did, and you said uncle wouldn't like
it, and the boys would tease, and you made Ariadne promise not to tell,
and she punched holes in your ears to put ear-rings in. So now! and
that's much badder than to take an old piece of rag; and I hate you for
making my Pokey cry."

Jamie's somewhat incoherent explosion produced such an effect that
Pokey's small sin was instantly forgotten, and Rose felt that her hour
had come.

"What! what! what!" cried the boys in a chorus, dropping their shovels
and knives to gather round Rose, for a guilty clutching at her ears
betrayed her, and with a feeble cry of "Ariadne made me!" she hid her
head among the pillows like an absurd little ostrich.

"Now she'll go prancing round with bird cages and baskets and carts and
pigs, for all I know, in her ears, as the other girls do, and won't she
look like a goose?" asked one tormentor, tweaking a curl that strayed
out from the cushions.

"I didn't think she'd be so silly," said Mac, in a tone of
disappointment that told Rose she had sunk in the esteem of her wise
cousin.

"That Blish girl is a nuisance, and ought not to be allowed to come here
with her nonsensical notions," said the Prince, feeling a strong desire
to shake that young person as an angry dog might shake a mischievous
kitten.

"How do you like it, uncle?" asked Archie, who, being the head of a
family himself, believed in preserving discipline at all costs.

"I am very much surprised; but I see she is a girl, after all, and must
have her vanities like all the rest of them," answered Dr. Alec, with
a sigh, as if he had expected to find Rose a sort of angel, above all
earthly temptations.

"What shall you do about it, sir?" inquired Geordie, wondering what
punishment would be inflicted on a feminine culprit.

"As she is fond of ornaments, perhaps we had better give her a nose-ring
also. I have one somewhere that a Fiji belle once wore; I'll look it
up," and, leaving Pokey to Jamie's care, Dr. Alec rose as if to carry
out his suggestion in earnest.

"Good! good! We'll do it right away! Here's a gimlet, so you hold
her, boys, while I get her dear little nose all ready," cried Charlie,
whisking away the pillow as the other boys danced about the sofa in true
Fiji style.

It was a dreadful moment, for Rose could not run away she could only
grasp her precious nose with one hand and extend the other, crying
distractedly,

"O uncle, save me, save me!"

Of course he saved her; and when she was securely barricaded by his
strong arm, she confessed her folly in such humiliation of spirit, that
the lads, after a good laugh at her, decided to forgive her and lay all
the blame on the tempter, Ariadne. Even Dr. Alec relented so far as to
propose two gold rings for the ears instead of one copper one for the
nose; a proceeding which proved that if Rose had all the weakness of
her sex for jewellery, he had all the inconsistency of his in giving a
pretty penitent exactly what she wanted, spite of his better judgment.



Chapter 16--Bread and Button-Holes

"What in the world is my girl thinking about all alone here, with such
a solemn face?" asked Dr. Alec, coming into the study, one November
day, to find Rose sitting there with folded hands and a very thoughtful
aspect.

"Uncle, I want to have some serious conversation with you, if you have
time," she said, coming out of a brown study, as if she had not heard
his question.

"I'm entirely at your service, and most happy to listen," he answered,
in his politest manner, for when Rose put on her womanly little airs he
always treated her with a playful sort of respect that pleased her very
much.

Now, as he sat down beside her, she said, very soberly,

"I've been trying to decide what trade I would learn, and I want you to
advise me."

"Trade, my dear?" and Dr. Alec looked so astonished that she hastened to
explain.

"I forgot that you didn't hear the talk about it up at Cosey Corner. You
see we used to sit under the pines and sew, and talk a great deal all
the ladies, I mean and I liked it very much. Mother Atkinson thought
that everyone should have a trade, or something to make a living out of,
for rich people may grow poor, you know, and poor people have to work.
Her girls were very clever, and could do ever so many things, and Aunt
Jessie thought the old lady was right; so when I saw how happy and
independent those young ladies were, I wanted to have a trade, and then
it wouldn't matter about money, though I like to have it well enough."

Dr. Alec listened to this explanation with a curious mixture of
surprise, pleasure, and amusement in his face, and looked at his little
niece as if she had suddenly changed into a young woman. She had grown a
good deal in the last six months, and an amount of thinking had gone on
in that young head which would have astonished him greatly could he have
known it all, for Rose was one of the children who observe and meditate
much, and now and then nonplus their friends by a wise or curious
remark.

"I quite agree with the ladies, and shall be glad to help you decide on
something if I can," said the Doctor seriously. "What do you incline to?
A natural taste or talent is a great help in choosing, you know."

"I haven't any talent, or any especial taste that I can see, and that is
why I can't decide, uncle. So, I think it would be a good plan to pick
out some very useful business and learn it, because I don't do it for
pleasure, you see, but as a part of my education, and to be ready in
case I'm ever poor," answered Rose, looking as if she rather longed for
a little poverty so that her useful gift might be exercised.

"Well, now, there is one very excellent, necessary, and womanly
accomplishment that no girl should be without, for it is a help to rich
and poor, and the comfort of families depends upon it. This fine talent
is neglected nowadays, and considered old-fashioned, which is a sad
mistake, and one that I don't mean to make in bringing up my girl.
It should be a part of every girl's education, and I know of a most
accomplished lady who will teach you in the best and pleasantest
manner."

"Oh, what is it?" cried Rose eagerly, charmed to be met in this helpful
and cordial way.

"Housekeeping!" answered Dr. Alec.

"Is that an accomplishment?" asked Rose, while her face fell, for she
had indulged in all sorts of vague, delightful dreams.

"Yes; it is one of the most beautiful as well as useful of all the
arts a woman can learn. Not so romantic, perhaps, as singing,
painting, writing, or teaching, even; but one that makes many happy and
comfortable, and home the sweetest place in the world. Yes, you may
open your big eyes; but it is a fact that I had rather see you a good
housekeeper than the greatest belle in the city. It need not interfere
with any talent you may possess, but it is a necessary part of your
training, and I hope that you will set about it at once, now that you
are well and strong."

"Who is the lady?" asked Rose, rather impressed by her uncle's earnest
speech.

"Aunt Plenty."

"Is she accomplished?" began Rose in a wondering tone, for this
great-aunt of hers had seemed the least cultivated of them all.

"In the good old-fashioned way she is very accomplished, and has made
this house a happy home to us all, ever since we can remember. She is
not elegant, but genuinely good, and so beloved and respected that there
will be universal mourning for her when her place is empty. No one can
fill it, for the solid, homely virtues of the dear soul have gone out of
fashion, as I say, and nothing new can be half so satisfactory, to me at
least."

"I should like to have people feel so about me. Can she teach me to do
what she does, and to grow as good?" asked Rose, with a little prick of
remorse for even thinking that Aunt Plenty was a commonplace old lady.

"Yes, if you don't despise such simple lessons as she can give. I know
