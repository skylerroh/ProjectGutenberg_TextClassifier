ARGUMENT

In a council of the Gods, Minerva calls their attention to Ulysses, still
a wanderer. They resolve to grant him a safe return to Ithaca. Minerva
descends to encourage Telemachus, and in the form of Mentes directs him
in what manner to proceed. Throughout this book the extravagance and
profligacy of the suitors are occasionally suggested.


    Muse make the man thy theme, for shrewdness famed
    And genius versatile, who far and wide
    A Wand'rer, after Ilium overthrown,
    Discover'd various cities, and the mind
    And manners learn'd of men, in lands remote.
    He num'rous woes on Ocean toss'd, endured,
    Anxious to save himself, and to conduct
    His followers to their home; yet all his care
    Preserved them not; they perish'd self-destroy'd
    By their own fault; infatuate! who devoured                       10
    The oxen of the all-o'erseeing Sun,
    And, punish'd for that crime, return'd no more.
    Daughter divine of Jove, these things record,
    As it may please thee, even in our ears.
      The rest, all those who had perdition 'scaped
    By war or on the Deep, dwelt now at home;
    Him only, of his country and his wife
    Alike desirous, in her hollow grots
    Calypso, Goddess beautiful, detained
    Wooing him to her arms. But when, at length,                      20
    (Many a long year elapsed) the year arrived
    Of his return (by the decree of heav'n)
    To Ithaca, not even then had he,
    Although surrounded by his people, reach'd
    The period of his suff'rings and his toils.
    Yet all the Gods, with pity moved, beheld
    His woes, save Neptune; He alone with wrath
    Unceasing and implacable pursued
    Godlike Ulysses to his native shores.
    But Neptune, now, the AEthiopians fought,                          30
    (The AEthiopians, utmost of mankind,
    These Eastward situate, those toward the West)
    Call'd to an hecatomb of bulls and lambs.
    There sitting, pleas'd he banqueted; the Gods
    In Jove's abode, meantime, assembled all,
    'Midst whom the Sire of heav'n and earth began.
    For he recall'd to mind AEgisthus slain
    By Agamemnon's celebrated son
    Orestes, and retracing in his thought
    That dread event, the Immortals thus address'd.                   40
      Alas! how prone are human-kind to blame
    The Pow'rs of Heav'n! From us, they say, proceed
    The ills which they endure, yet more than Fate
    Herself inflicts, by their own crimes incur.
    So now AEgisthus, by no force constrained
    Of Destiny, Atrides' wedded wife
    Took to himself, and him at his return
    Slew, not unwarn'd of his own dreadful end
    By us: for we commanded Hermes down
    The watchful Argicide, who bade him fear                          50
    Alike, to slay the King, or woo the Queen.
    For that Atrides' son Orestes, soon
    As grown mature, and eager to assume
    His sway imperial, should avenge the deed.
    So Hermes spake, but his advice moved not
    AEgisthus, on whose head the whole arrear
    Of vengeance heap'd, at last, hath therefore fall'n.
      Whom answer'd then Pallas caerulean-eyed.
    Oh Jove, Saturnian Sire, o'er all supreme!
    And well he merited the death he found;                           60
    So perish all, who shall, like him, offend.
    But with a bosom anguish-rent I view
    Ulysses, hapless Chief! who from his friends
    Remote, affliction hath long time endured
    In yonder wood-land isle, the central boss
    Of Ocean. That retreat a Goddess holds,
    Daughter of sapient Atlas, who the abyss
    Knows to its bottom, and the pillars high
    Himself upbears which sep'rate earth from heav'n.
    His daughter, there, the sorrowing Chief detains,                 70
    And ever with smooth speech insidious seeks
    To wean his heart from Ithaca; meantime
    Ulysses, happy might he but behold
    The smoke ascending from his native land,
    Death covets. Canst thou not, Olympian Jove!
    At last relent? Hath not Ulysses oft
    With victims slain amid Achaia's fleet
    Thee gratified, while yet at Troy he fought?
    How hath he then so deep incensed thee, Jove?
      To whom, the cloud-assembler God replied.                       80
    What word hath pass'd thy lips, Daughter belov'd?
    Can I forget Ulysses? Him forget
    So noble, who in wisdom all mankind
    Excels, and who hath sacrific'd so oft
    To us whose dwelling is the boundless heav'n?
    Earth-circling Neptune--He it is whose wrath
    Pursues him ceaseless for the Cyclops' sake
    Polypheme, strongest of the giant race,
    Whom of his eye Ulysses hath deprived.
    For Him, Thooesa bore, Nymph of the sea                            90
    From Phorcys sprung, by Ocean's mighty pow'r
    Impregnated in caverns of the Deep.
    E'er since that day, the Shaker of the shores,
    Although he slay him not, yet devious drives
    Ulysses from his native isle afar.
    Yet come--in full assembly his return
    Contrive we now, both means and prosp'rous end;
    So Neptune shall his wrath remit, whose pow'r
    In contest with the force of all the Gods
    Exerted single, can but strive in vain.                          100
      To whom Minerva, Goddess azure-eyed.
    Oh Jupiter! above all Kings enthroned!
    If the Immortals ever-blest ordain
    That wise Ulysses to his home return,
    Dispatch we then Hermes the Argicide,
    Our messenger, hence to Ogygia's isle,
    Who shall inform Calypso, nymph divine,
    Of this our fixt resolve, that to his home
    Ulysses, toil-enduring Chief, repair.
    Myself will hence to Ithaca, meantime,                           110
    His son to animate, and with new force
    Inspire, that (the Achaians all convened
    In council,) he may, instant, bid depart
    The suitors from his home, who, day by day,
    His num'rous flocks and fatted herds consume.
    And I will send him thence to Sparta forth,
    And into sandy Pylus, there to hear
    (If hear he may) some tidings of his Sire,
    And to procure himself a glorious name.
      This said, her golden sandals to her feet                      120
    She bound, ambrosial, which o'er all the earth
    And o'er the moist flood waft her fleet as air,
    Then, seizing her strong spear pointed with brass,
    In length and bulk, and weight a matchless beam,
    With which the Jove-born Goddess levels ranks
    Of Heroes, against whom her anger burns,
    From the Olympian summit down she flew,
    And on the threshold of Ulysses' hall
    In Ithaca, and within his vestibule
    Apparent stood; there, grasping her bright spear,                130
    Mentes[1] she seem'd, the hospitable Chief
    Of Taphos' isle--she found the haughty throng
    The suitors; they before the palace gate
    With iv'ry cubes sported, on num'rous hides
    Reclined of oxen which themselves had slain.
    The heralds and the busy menials there
    Minister'd to them; these their mantling cups
    With water slaked; with bibulous sponges those
    Made clean the tables, set the banquet on,
    And portioned out to each his plenteous share.                   140
    Long ere the rest Telemachus himself
    Mark'd her, for sad amid them all he sat,
    Pourtraying in deep thought contemplative
    His noble Sire, and questioning if yet
    Perchance the Hero might return to chase
    From all his palace that imperious herd,
    To his own honour lord of his own home.
    Amid them musing thus, sudden he saw
    The Goddess, and sprang forth, for he abhorr'd
    To see a guest's admittance long delay'd;                        150
    Approaching eager, her right hand he seized,
    The brazen spear took from her, and in words
    With welcome wing'd Minerva thus address'd.
      Stranger, all hail! to share our cordial love
    Thou com'st; the banquet finish'd, thou shalt next
    Inform me wherefore thou hast here arrived.
      So saying, toward the spacious hall he moved,
    Follow'd by Pallas, and, arriving soon
    Beneath the lofty roof, placed her bright spear
    Within a pillar's cavity, long time                              160
    The armoury where many a spear had stood,
    Bright weapons of his own illustrious Sire.
    Then, leading her toward a footstool'd throne
    Magnificent, which first he overspread
    With linen, there he seated her, apart
    From that rude throng, and for himself disposed
    A throne of various colours at her side,
    Lest, stunn'd with clamour of the lawless band,
    The new-arrived should loth perchance to eat,
    And that more free he might the stranger's ear                   170
    With questions of his absent Sire address,
    And now a maiden charg'd with golden ew'r,
    And with an argent laver, pouring first
    Pure water on their hands, supplied them, next,
    With a resplendent table, which the chaste
    Directress of the stores furnish'd with bread
    And dainties, remnants of the last regale.
    Then, in his turn, the sewer[2] with sav'ry meats,
    Dish after dish, served them, of various kinds,
    And golden cups beside the chargers placed,                      180
    Which the attendant herald fill'd with wine.
    Ere long, in rush'd the suitors, and the thrones
    And couches occupied, on all whose hands
    The heralds pour'd pure water; then the maids
    Attended them with bread in baskets heap'd,
    And eager they assail'd the ready feast.
    At length, when neither thirst nor hunger more
    They felt unsatisfied, to new delights
    Their thoughts they turn'd, to song and sprightly dance,
    Enlivening sequel of the banquet's joys.                         190
    An herald, then, to Phemius' hand consign'd
    His beauteous lyre; he through constraint regaled
    The suitors with his song, and while the chords
    He struck in prelude to his pleasant strains,
    Telemachus his head inclining nigh
    To Pallas' ear, lest others should his words
    Witness, the blue-eyed Goddess thus bespake.
      My inmate and my friend! far from my lips
    Be ev'ry word that might displease thine ear!
    The song--the harp,--what can they less than charm               200
    These wantons? who the bread unpurchased eat
    Of one whose bones on yonder continent
    Lie mould'ring, drench'd by all the show'rs of heaven,
    Or roll at random in the billowy deep.
    Ah! could they see him once to his own isle
    Restored, both gold and raiment they would wish
    Far less, and nimbleness of foot instead.
    But He, alas! hath by a wretched fate,
    Past question perish'd, and what news soe'er
    We hear of his return, kindles no hope                           210
    In us, convinced that he returns no more.
    But answer undissembling; tell me true;
    Who art thou? whence? where stands thy city? where
    Thy father's mansion? In what kind of ship
    Cam'st thou? Why steer'd the mariners their course
    To Ithaca, and of what land are they?
    For that on foot thou found'st us not, is sure.
    This also tell me, hast thou now arrived
    New to our isle, or wast thou heretofore
    My father's guest? Since many to our house                       220
    Resorted in those happier days, for he
    Drew pow'rful to himself the hearts of all.
      Then Pallas thus, Goddess caerulean-eyed.
    I will with all simplicity of truth
    Thy questions satisfy. Behold in me
    Mentes, the offspring of a Chief renown'd
    In war, Anchialus; and I rule, myself,
    An island race, the Taphians oar-expert.
    With ship and mariners I now arrive,
    Seeking a people of another tongue                               230
    Athwart the gloomy flood, in quest of brass
    For which I barter steel, ploughing the waves
    To Temesa. My ship beneath the woods
    Of Neius, at yonder field that skirts
    Your city, in the haven Rhethrus rides.
    We are hereditary guests; our Sires
    Were friends long since; as, when thou seest him next,
    The Hero old Laertes will avouch,
    Of whom, I learn, that he frequents no more
    The city now, but in sequester'd scenes                          240
    Dwells sorrowful, and by an antient dame
    With food and drink supplied oft as he feels
    Refreshment needful to him, while he creeps
    Between the rows of his luxuriant vines.
    But I have come drawn hither by report,
    Which spake thy Sire arrived, though still it seems
    The adverse Gods his homeward course retard.
    For not yet breathless lies the noble Chief,
    But in some island of the boundless flood
    Resides a prisoner, by barbarous force                           250
    Of some rude race detained reluctant there.
    And I will now foreshow thee what the Gods
    Teach me, and what, though neither augur skill'd
    Nor prophet, I yet trust shall come to pass.
    He shall not, henceforth, live an exile long
    From his own shores, no, not although in bands
    Of iron held, but will ere long contrive
    His own return; for in expedients, framed
    With wond'rous ingenuity, he abounds.
    But tell me true; art thou, in stature such,                     260
    Son of himself Ulysses? for thy face
    And eyes bright-sparkling, strongly indicate
    Ulysses in thee. Frequent have we both
    Conversed together thus, thy Sire and I,
    Ere yet he went to Troy, the mark to which
    So many Princes of Achaia steer'd.
    Him since I saw not, nor Ulysses me.
      To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.
    Stranger! I tell thee true; my mother's voice
    Affirms me his, but since no mortal knows                        270
    His derivation, I affirm it not.
    Would I had been son of some happier Sire,
    Ordain'd in calm possession of his own
    To reach the verge of life. But now, report
    Proclaims me his, whom I of all mankind
    Unhappiest deem.--Thy question is resolved.
      Then answer thus Pallas blue-eyed return'd.
    From no ignoble race, in future days,
    The Gods shall prove thee sprung, whom so endow'd
    With ev'ry grace Penelope hath borne.                            280
    But tell me true. What festival is this?
    This throng--whence are they? wherefore hast thou need
    Of such a multitude? Behold I here
    A banquet, or a nuptial? for these
    Meet not by contribution[3] to regale,
    With such brutality and din they hold
    Their riotous banquet! a wise man and good
    Arriving, now, among them, at the sight
    Of such enormities would much be wroth.
      To whom replied Telemachus discrete.                           290
    Since, stranger! thou hast ask'd, learn also this.
    While yet Ulysses, with his people dwelt,
    His presence warranted the hope that here
    Virtue should dwell and opulence; but heav'n
    Hath cast for us, at length, a diff'rent lot,
    And he is lost, as never man before.
    For I should less lament even his death,
    Had he among his friends at Ilium fall'n,
    Or in the arms of his companions died,
    Troy's siege accomplish'd. Then his tomb the Greeks              300
    Of ev'ry tribe had built, and for his son,
    He had immortal glory atchieved; but now,
    By harpies torn inglorious, beyond reach
    Of eye or ear he lies; and hath to me
    Grief only, and unceasing sighs bequeath'd.
    Nor mourn I for his sake alone; the Gods
    Have plann'd for me still many a woe beside;
    For all the rulers of the neighbour isles,
    Samos, Dulichium, and the forest-crown'd
    Zacynthus, others also, rulers here                              310
    In craggy Ithaca, my mother seek
    In marriage, and my household stores consume.
    But neither she those nuptial rites abhorr'd,
    Refuses absolute, nor yet consents
    To end them; they my patrimony waste
    Meantime, and will not long spare even me.
      To whom, with deep commiseration pang'd,
    Pallas replied. Alas! great need hast thou
    Of thy long absent father to avenge
    These num'rous wrongs; for could he now appear                   320
    There, at yon portal, arm'd with helmet, shield,
    And grasping his two spears, such as when first
    I saw him drinking joyous at our board,
    From Ilus son of Mermeris, who dwelt
    In distant Ephyre, just then return'd,
    (For thither also had Ulysses gone
    In his swift bark, seeking some pois'nous drug
    Wherewith to taint his brazen arrows keen,
    Which drug through fear of the eternal Gods
    Ilus refused him, and my father free                             330
    Gave to him, for he loved him past belief)
    Could now, Ulysses, clad in arms as then,
    Mix with these suitors, short his date of life
    To each, and bitter should his nuptials prove.
    But these events, whether he shall return
    To take just vengeance under his own roof,
    Or whether not, lie all in the Gods lap.
    Meantime I counsel thee, thyself to think
    By what means likeliest thou shalt expel
    These from thy doors. Now mark me: close attend.                 340
    To-morrow, summoning the Grecian Chiefs
    To council, speak to them, and call the Gods
    To witness that solemnity. Bid go
    The suitors hence, each to his own abode.
    Thy mother--if her purpose be resolved
    On marriage, let her to the house return
    Of her own potent father, who, himself,
    Shall furnish forth her matrimonial rites,
    And ample dow'r, such as it well becomes
    A darling daughter to receive, bestow.                           350
    But hear me now; thyself I thus advise.
    The prime of all thy ships preparing, mann'd
    With twenty rowers, voyage hence to seek
    Intelligence of thy long-absent Sire.
    Some mortal may inform thee, or a word,[4]
    Perchance, by Jove directed (safest source
    Of notice to mankind) may reach thine ear.
    First voyaging to Pylus, there enquire
    Of noble Nestor; thence to Sparta tend,
    To question Menelaus amber-hair'd,                               360
    Latest arrived of all the host of Greece.
    There should'st thou learn that still thy father lives,
    And hope of his return, although
    Distress'd, thou wilt be patient yet a year.
    But should'st thou there hear tidings that he breathes
    No longer, to thy native isle return'd,
    First heap his tomb; then with such pomp perform
    His funeral rites as his great name demands,
    And make thy mother's spousals, next, thy care.
    These duties satisfied, delib'rate last                          370
    Whether thou shalt these troublers of thy house
    By stratagem, or by assault, destroy.
    For thou art now no child, nor longer may'st
    Sport like one. Hast thou not the proud report
    Heard, how Orestes hath renown acquired
    With all mankind, his father's murtherer
    AEgisthus slaying, the deceiver base
    Who slaughter'd Agamemnon? Oh my friend!
    (For with delight thy vig'rous growth I view,
    And just proportion) be thou also bold,                          380
    And merit praise from ages yet to come.
    But I will to my vessel now repair,
    And to my mariners, whom, absent long,
    I may perchance have troubled. Weigh thou well
    My counsel; let not my advice be lost.
      To whom Telemachus discrete replied.
    Stranger! thy words bespeak thee much my friend,
    Who, as a father teaches his own son,
    Hast taught me, and I never will forget.
    But, though in haste thy voyage to pursue,                       390
    Yet stay, that in the bath refreshing first
    Thy limbs now weary, thou may'st sprightlier seek
    Thy gallant bark, charged with some noble gift
    Of finish'd workmanship, which thou shalt keep
    As my memorial ever; such a boon
    As men confer on guests whom much they love.
      Then Pallas thus, Goddess caerulean-eyed.
    Retard me not, for go I must; the gift
    Which liberal thou desirest to bestow,
    Give me at my return, that I may bear                            400
    The treasure home; and, in exchange, thyself
    Expect some gift equivalent from me.
      She spake, and as with eagle-wings upborne,
    Vanish'd incontinent, but him inspired
    With daring fortitude, and on his heart
    Dearer remembrance of his Sire impress'd
    Than ever. Conscious of the wond'rous change,
    Amazed he stood, and, in his secret thought
    Revolving all, believed his guest a God.
    The youthful Hero to the suitors then                            410
    Repair'd; they silent, listen'd to the song
    Of the illustrious Bard: he the return
    Deplorable of the Achaian host
    From Ilium by command of Pallas, sang.
    Penelope, Icarius' daughter, mark'd
    Meantime the song celestial, where she sat
    In the superior palace; down she came,
    By all the num'rous steps of her abode;
    Not sole, for two fair handmaids follow'd her.
    She then, divinest of her sex, arrived                           420
    In presence of that lawless throng, beneath
    The portal of her stately mansion stood,
    Between her maidens, with her lucid veil
    Her lovely features mantling. There, profuse
    She wept, and thus the sacred bard bespake.
      Phemius! for many a sorrow-soothing strain
    Thou know'st beside, such as exploits record
    Of Gods and men, the poet's frequent theme;
    Give them of those a song, and let themselves
    Their wine drink noiseless; but this mournful strain             430
    Break off, unfriendly to my bosom's peace,
    And which of all hearts nearest touches mine,
    With such regret my dearest Lord I mourn,
    Rememb'ring still an husband praised from side
    To side, and in the very heart of Greece.
      Then answer thus Telemachus return'd.
    My mother! wherefore should it give thee pain
    If the delightful bard that theme pursue
    To which he feels his mind impell'd? the bard
    Blame not, but rather Jove, who, as he wills,                    440
    Materials for poetic art supplies.
    No fault is his, if the disastrous fate
    He sing of the Achaians, for the song
    Wins ever from the hearers most applause
    That has been least in use. Of all who fought
    At Troy, Ulysses hath not lost, alone,
    His day of glad return; but many a Chief
    Hath perish'd also. Seek thou then again
    Thy own apartment, spindle ply and loom,
    And task thy maidens; management belongs                         450
    To men of joys convivial, and of men
    Especially to me, chief ruler here.
      She heard astonish'd; and the prudent speech
    Reposing of her son deep in her heart,
    Again with her attendant maidens sought
    Her upper chamber. There arrived, she wept
    Her lost Ulysses, till Minerva bathed
    Her weary lids in dewy sleep profound.
    Then echoed through the palace dark-bedimm'd
    With evening shades the suitors boist'rous roar,                 460
    For each the royal bed burn'd to partake,
    Whom thus Telemachus discrete address'd.
      All ye my mother's suitors, though addict
    To contumacious wrangling fierce, suspend
    Your clamour, for a course to me it seems
    More decent far, when such a bard as this,
    Godlike, for sweetness, sings, to hear his song.
    To-morrow meet we in full council all,
    That I may plainly warn you to depart
    From this our mansion. Seek ye where ye may                      470
    Your feasts; consume your own; alternate feed
    Each at the other's cost; but if it seem
    Wisest in your account and best, to eat
    Voracious thus the patrimonial goods
    Of one man, rend'ring no account of all,[5]
    Bite to the roots; but know that I will cry
    Ceaseless to the eternal Gods, in hope
    That Jove, for retribution of the wrong,
    Shall doom you, where ye have intruded, there
    To bleed, and of your blood ask no account.[5]                   480
      He ended, and each gnaw'd his lip, aghast
    At his undaunted hardiness of speech.
      Then thus Antinoues spake, Eupithes' son.
    Telemachus! the Gods, methinks, themselves
    Teach thee sublimity, and to pronounce
    Thy matter fearless. Ah forbid it, Jove!
    That one so eloquent should with the weight
    Of kingly cares in Ithaca be charged,
    A realm, by claim hereditary, thine.
      Then prudent thus Telemachus replied.                          490
