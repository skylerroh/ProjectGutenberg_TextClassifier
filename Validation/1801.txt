      And fired his zeal along the road.

The Power of Faith.


1   Faith adds new charms to earthly bliss,
      And saves us from its snares;
    Its aid in every duty brings,
      And softens all our cares.

2   The wounded conscience knows its power
      The healing balm to give;
    That balm the saddest heart can cheer,
      And make the dying live.

3   Wide it unveils celestial worlds,
      Where deathless pleasures reign,
    And bids us seek our portion there,
      Nor bids us seek in vain.

4   On that bright prospect may we rest,
      Till this frail body dies;
    And then, on faith's triumphant wings,
      To endless glory rise.




376.            S. H. M.       Christian Watchman.

Excellence of Faith.


1       Faith is the Christian's prop
        Whereon his sorrows lean;
      It is the substance of his hope,
        His proof of things unseen;
    It is the anchor of his soul
    When tempests rage and billows roll.

2       Faith is the polar star
        That guides the Christian's way,
      Directs his wanderings from afar
        To realms of endless day;
    It points the course where'er he roam,
    And safely leads the pilgrim home.

3       Faith is the rainbow's form,
        Hung on the brow of heaven,
      The glory of the passing storm,
        The pledge of mercy given;
    It is the bright, triumphal arch,
    Through which the saints to glory march.




377.              C. M.                 Bath Coll.

Prayer for Strong Faith.


1   O, for a faith that will not shrink
      Though pressed by every foe,
    That will not tremble on the brink
      Of any earthly woe!--

2   That will not murmur nor complain
      Beneath the chastening rod,
    But, in the hour of grief or pain,
      Will lean upon its God;--

3   A faith that shines more bright and clear
      When tempests rage without;
    That when in danger knows no fear,
      In darkness feels no doubt;--

4   Lord, give us such a faith as this,
      And then, whate'er may come,
    We'll taste, e'en here, the hallowed bliss
      Of an eternal home.




378.              C. M.                    Sidney.

Hope.


1   Borne o'er the ocean's stormy wave,
      The beacon's light appears,
    When yawns the seaman's watery grave,
      And his lone bosom cheers.

2   Then, should the raging ocean foam,
      His heart shall dauntless prove,
    To reach, secure, his cherished home,
      The haven of his love.

3   So, when the soul is wrapt in gloom,
      To worldly grief a prey,
    Thy beams, blest Hope, beyond the tomb,
      Illume the pilgrim's way.

4   They point to that serene abode
      Where holy faith shall rest,
    Protected by the sufferer's God,
      And be forever blest.

The Christian rejoicing in Hope.


1   Children of the Heavenly King,
    As ye journey, sweetly sing;
    Sing your Saviour's worthy praise,
    Glorious in his works and ways.

2   Ye are travelling home to God,
    In the way the fathers trod;
    They are happy now, and ye
    Soon their happiness shall see.

3   Shout, ye little flock, and blest;
    You on Jesus' throne shall rest;
    There your seat is now prepared,
    There your kingdom and reward.

4   Lord, submissive make us go,
    Ready, leaving all below;
    Only thou our Leader be,
    And we still will follow thee.




380.              C. M.              H. H. Hawley.

The Hope, the Star, the Voice.


1   There is a hope, a blessed hope,
      More precious and more bright
    Than all the joyless mockery
      The world esteems delight.

2   There is a star, a lovely star,
      That lights the darkest gloom,
    And sheds a peaceful radiance o'er
      The prospects of the tomb.

3   There is a voice, a cheering voice,
      That lifts the soul above,
    Dispels the painful, anxious doubt,
      And whispers, "God is love."

4   That voice, aloud from Calvary's height,
      Proclaims the soul forgiven;
    That star is revelation's light;
      That hope, the hope of heaven.




381.              C. M.                   Drennan.

Law of Love.


1   All nature feels attractive power,
      A strong, embracing force;
    The drops that sparkle in the shower,
      The planets in their course.

2   Thus, in the universe of mind,
      Is felt the law of love;
    The charity both strong and kind,
      For all that live and move.

3   In this fine sympathetic chain
      All creatures bear a part;
    Their every pleasure, every pain,
      Linked to the feeling heart.

4   More perfect bond, the Christian plan
      Attaches soul to soul;
    Our neighbor is the suffering man,
      Though at the farthest pole.

5   To earth below, from heaven above,
      The faith in Christ professed,
    More clearly shows that God is love,
      And whom he loves is blessed.




382.              C. M.                 Doddridge.

The Same.


1   O, may our sympathizing breasts
      The generous pleasure know,
    Kindly to share in others' joy,
      And weep for others' woe!

2   Where'er the helpless sons of grief
      In low distress are laid,
    Soft be our hearts their pains to feel,
      And swift our hands to aid.

3   O, be the law of love fulfilled
      In every act and thought,
    Each angry passion far removed,
      Each selfish view forgot!

4   Be thou, my heart, dilated wide
      With this kind, social grace,
    And, in one grasp of fervent love,
      All earth and heaven embrace.




383.              C. M.                     Watts.

Love to God.


1   Happy the heart where graces reign,
      Where love inspires the breast:
    Love is the brightest of the train,
      And strengthens all the rest.

2   Knowledge--alas! 'tis all in vain,
      And all in vain our fear;
    Our stubborn sins will fight and reign,
      If love be absent there.

3   This is the grace that lives and sings,
      When faith and hope shall cease;
    'Tis this shall strike our joyful strings
      In realms of endless peace.

4   Before we quite forsake our clay,
      Or leave this dark abode,
    The wings of love bear us away
      To see our gracious God.




384.              L. M.                    Browne.

Love to all Mankind.


1   O God, my Father, and my King,
    Of all I have, or hope, the spring!
    Send down thy spirit from above,
    And fill my heart with heavenly love.

2   May I from every act abstain,
    That hurts or gives another pain:
    And bear a sympathizing part,
    Whene'er I meet a wounded heart.

3   And let my neighbor's prosperous state
    A mutual joy in me create;
    His virtuous triumph let me join;
    His peace and happiness be mine.

4   And though my neighbor's hate I prove,
    Still let me vanquish hate with love;
    And every secret wish suppress,
    That would abridge his happiness.

5   Let love through all my conduct shine,
    An image fair, though faint, of thine!
    Thus let me his disciple prove,
    Who came to manifest thy love.

The Two Commandments.


1   This is the first and great command--
      To love thy God above;
    And this the second--as thyself
      Thy neighbor thou shalt love.

2   Who is my neighbor? He who wants
      The help which thou canst give;
    And both the law and prophets say,
      This do, and thou shalt live.

Christ's Love to Enemies our Example.


1   God of our mercy and our praise,
      Thy glory is our song;
    We'll speak the honors of thy grace
      With a rejoicing tongue.

2   When Christ among the sons of men
      In humble form was found,
    With cruel slanders, false and vain,
      They compassed him around.

3   Their miseries his compassion moved,
      Their peace he still pursued;
    They rendered hatred for his love,
      And evil for his good.

4   Their malice raged without a cause;
      Yet, with his dying breath,
    He prayed for murderers on his cross,
      And blest his foes in death.

5   O, may his conduct, all divine,
      To us a model prove:
    Like his, O God, our hearts incline
      Our enemies to love.




387.              C. M.        Christian Psalmist.

Faith, Hope and Charity.


1   Faith, hope, and love, now dwell on earth,
      And earth by them is blest;
    But faith and hope must yield to love,
      Of all the graces best.

2   Hope shall to full fruition rise,
      And faith be sight above;
    These are the means, but this the end,
      For saints forever love.




388.              L. M.                Montgomery.

The Christian Graces.


1   Faith, hope, and charity, these three,
    Yet is the greatest charity;
    Father of lights, these gifts impart
    To mine and every human heart.

2   Faith, that in prayer can never fail,
    Hope, that o'er doubting must prevail,
    And charity, whose name above
    Is God's own name, for God is love.

3   The morning star is lost in light,
    Faith vanishes at perfect sight,
    The rainbow passes with the storm
    And hope with sorrow's fading form.

4   But charity, serene, sublime,
    Beyond the reach of death and time,
    Like the blue sky's all-bounding space,
    Holds heaven and earth in its embrace.




389.              C. M.                     Watts.

A Living and a Dead Faith.


1   Mistaken souls! that dream of heaven,
      And make their empty boast
    Of inward joys, and sins forgiven,
      While they are slaves to lust.

2   Vain are our fancies, airy flights,
      If faith be cold and dead;
    None but a living power unites
      To Christ the living head.

3   'T is faith that purifies the heart;
      'T is faith that works by love;
    That bids all sinful joys depart,
      And lifts the thoughts above.

4   This faith shall every fear control
      By its celestial power,
    With holy triumph fill the soul
      In death's approaching hour.

"Two men went up into the temple to pray."


1   The uplifted eye, and bended knee,
    Are but vain homage, Lord, to thee;
    In vain our lips thy praise prolong,
    The heart a stranger to the song.

2   The pure, the humble, contrite mind,
    Sincere, and to thy will resigned,
    To thee a nobler offering yields,
    Than Sheba's groves, or Sharon's fields.

3   Love God and man--this great command,
    Doth on eternal pillars stand;
    This did thine ancient prophets teach,
    And this thy Well-Beloved preach.

Brotherly Love.  Ps. 133.


1     How beautiful the sight
        Of brethren who agree
      In friendship to unite,
        And bonds of charity!
    'T is like the precious ointment shed
    O'er all his robes from Aaron's head.

2     'Tis like the dews that fill
        The cups of Hermon's flowers;
      Or Zion's fruitful hill,
        Bright with the drops of showers;
    When mingling odors breathe around,
    And glory rests on all the ground.

3     For there the Lord commands
        Blessings, a boundless store,
      From his unsparing hands,
        Yea, life for evermore.
    Thrice happy they who meet above
    To spend eternity in love!

The Harmony of Love.


1   Lord! subdue our selfish will;
      Each to each our tempers suit,
    By thy modulating skill,
      Heart to heart, as lute to lute.

2   Sweetly on our spirits move;
      Gently touch the trembling strings:
    Make the harmony of love,
      Music for the King of kings!




393.              S. M.                     Watts.

The Bond of Peace.


1     Blest are the sons of peace,
      Whose hearts and hopes are one;
    Whose kind designs to serve and please
      Through all their actions run.

2     Blest is the pious house
      Where zeal and friendship meet;
    Their songs of praise, their mingled vows,
      Make their communion sweet.

3     Thus on the heavenly hills
      The saints are blest above,
    Where joy like morning dew distils,
      And all the air is love.




394.              C. M.                Montgomery.

"The unity of the spirit in the bond of peace."


1   The glorious universe around,
      The heavens with all their train,
    Sun, moon, and stars, are firmly bound
      In one mysterious chain.

2   The earth, the ocean, and the sky,
      To form one world agree,
    Where all that walk, or swim, or fly,
      Compose one family.

3   In one fraternal bond of love,
      One fellowship of mind,
    The saints below and saints above
      Their bliss and glory find.

4   Here in their house of pilgrimage,
      Thy statutes are their song;
    There, through one bright, eternal age,
      Thy praises they prolong.

The Church on Earth and in Heaven, One.


1   The saints on earth and those above
      But one communion make:
    Joined to their Lord in bonds of love,
      All of his grace partake.

2   One family, we dwell in him;
      One church above, beneath;
    Though now divided by the stream,
      The swelling stream of death.

3   One army of the living God,--
      To his command we bow;
    Part of the host have crossed the flood,
      And part are crossing now.

4   O God, be thou our constant guide!
      And when the word is given,
    Sustain us o'er the fearful tide,
      And bring us safe to heaven.




396.              S. M.                   Beddome.

Christian Unity.


1     Let party names no more
      The Christian world o'erspread;
    Gentile and Jew, and bond and free,
      Are one in Christ their head.

2     Among the saints on earth
      Let mutual love be found;
    Heirs of the same inheritance,
      With mutual blessings crowned.

3     Let envy and ill-will
      Be banished far away;
    Those should in holy friendship dwell,
      Who the same Lord obey.

4     Thus will the church below
      Resemble that above;
    Where streams of pleasure always flow,
      And every heart is love.




397.              L. M.                  Barbauld.

Christian Friendship.


1   How blest the sacred tie that binds
    In union sweet according minds!
    How swift the heavenly course they run,
    Whose hearts, and faith, and hopes are one!

2   To each the soul of each how dear!
    What jealous love, what holy fear!
    How doth the generous flame within
    Refine from earth, and cleanse from sin!

3   Their streaming eyes together flow
    For human guilt and mortal woe;
    Their ardent prayers together rise
    Like mingling flames in sacrifice.

4   Together shall they seek the place
    Where God reveals his awful face:
    How high, how strong, their raptures swell
    There's none but kindred souls can tell.




398.              L. M.                 Anonymous.

Charitable Judgment.


1   Omniscient God, 'tis thine to know
    The springs whence wrong opinions flow;
    To judge from principles within,
    When frailty errs, and when we sin.

2   Who with another's eye can read,
    Or worship by another's creed?
    Revering thy command alone,
    We humbly seek and use our own.

3   If wrong, forgive; accept, if right,
    Whilst faithful, we obey our light,
    And judging none, are zealous still
    To follow, as to learn, thy will.

4   When shall our happy eyes behold
    Thy people, fashioned in thy mould?
    And charity our kindred prove
    Derived from thee, O God of love?




399.              L. M.                     Watts.

The Same.


1   Not different food, nor different dress,
      Compose the kingdom of our Lord;
    But peace, and joy, and righteousness,
      Faith, and obedience to his word.

2   When weaker Christians we despise,
      We do the gospel mighty wrong;
    For God, the gracious and the wise,
      Receives the feeble with the strong.

3   Let pride and wrath be banished hence,
      Meekness and love our souls pursue,
    Nor shall our practice give offence
      To saints, the Gentile or the Jew.

Private Judgment and Accountability.


1     Imposture shrinks from light,
      And dreads the curious eye;
    But sacred truths the test invite,
      They bid us search and try.

2     With understanding blest,
      Created to be free,
    Our faith on man we dare not rest,
      Subject to none but thee.

3     Lord, give the light we need;
      With soundest knowledge fill;
    From noxious error guard our creed,
      From prejudice our will.

4     The truth thou shalt impart,
      May we with firmness own;
    Abhorring each evasive art,
      And fearing thee alone.

True Zeal.


1   Zeal is that pure and heavenly flame
      The fire of love supplies;
    Whilst that which often bears the name,
      Is self but in disguise.

2   True zeal is merciful and mild,
      Can pity and forbear;
    The false is headstrong, fierce and wild,
      And breathes revenge and war.

3   While zeal for truth the Christian warms,
      He knows the worth of peace;
    But self contends for names and forms,
      Its party to increase.

4   Zeal has attained its highest aim,
      Its end is satisfied,
    If sinners love the Saviour's name,--
      Nor seeks it aught beside.

5   This idol self, O Lord, dethrone,
      And from our hearts remove;
    And let no zeal by us be shown
      But that which springs from love.

Moderation.


1   Happy the man whose cautious steps
      Still keep the golden mean;
    Whose life by wisdom's rules well formed,
      Declares a conscience clean.

2   To sect or party his large soul
      Disdains to be confined;
    The good he loves of every name,
      And prays for all mankind.

3   His business is to keep his heart;
      Each passion to control;
    Nobly ambitious well to rule
      The empire of his soul.

4   Not on the world his heart is set,
      His treasure is above;
    Nothing beneath the sovereign good
      Can claim his highest love.

The Independent and Happy Man.


1   How happy is he born or taught,
      Who serveth not another's will;
    Whose armor is his honest thought,
      And simple truth his highest skill;

2   Whose passions not his masters are;
      Whose soul is still prepared for death;
    Not tied unto the world with care
      Of prince's ear or vulgar breath;

3   Who God doth late and early pray
      More of his grace than goods to lend,
    And walks with man from day to day,
      As with a brother and a friend.

4   This man is freed from servile bands
      Of hope to rise, or fear to fall;
    Lord of himself, though not of lands,
      And having nothing, yet hath all.

Wisdom.


1   O happy is the man, who hears
      Instruction's warning voice;
    And who celestial wisdom makes
      His early, only choice.

2   Her treasures are of more esteem
      Than east or west unfold;
    And her rewards more precious are
      Than all their mines of gold.

3   In her right hand she holds to view
      A length of happy days;
    Riches with splendid honors joined,
      Her left hand full displays.

4   She guides the young with innocence
      In pleasure's path to tread;
    A crown of glory she bestows
      Upon the hoary head.

5   According as her labors rise,
      So her rewards increase;
    Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
      And all her paths are peace.

"They shall walk and not faint."


1   Mere human power shall fast decay,
      And youthful vigor cease;
    But they who wait upon the Lord
      In strength shall still increase.

2   They with unwearied feet shall tread
      The path of life divine,
    With growing ardor onward move,
      With growing brightness shine.

3   On eagles' wings they mount, they soar;
      Their wings are faith and love;
    Till, past the cloudy regions here,
      They rise to heaven above.

Hidden Life of the Christian.


1   O happy soul that lives on high,
      While men lie grovelling here!
    His hopes are fixed above the sky,
      And faith forbids his fear.

2   His conscience knows no secret stings,
      While grace and joy combine
    To form a life whose holy springs
      Are hidden and divine.

3   He waits in secret on his God;
      His God in secret sees;
    Let earth be all in arms abroad,
      He dwells in heavenly peace.

4   His pleasures rise from things unseen,
      Beyond this world and time;
    Where neither eyes nor ears have been,
      Nor thoughts of mortals climb.

5   He wants no pomp nor royal throne
      To raise his honors here;
    Content and pleased to live unknown,
      Till Christ, his life, appear.

"That they also may be one in us."


1   Lord, from whom all blessings flow,
    Perfecting the church below!
    Steadfast may we cleave to thee;
    Love the mystic union be.
    Join our faithful spirits, join
    Each to each, and all to thine:
    Lead us through the paths of peace,
    On to perfect holiness.

2   Sweetly may we all agree,
    Touched with softest sympathy:
    There is neither bond nor free,
    Great nor servile, Lord, in thee;
    Love, like death, hath all destroyed
    Rendered all distinctions void!
    Names, and sects, and parties fall:
    Thou, O Christ, art all in all!

Religion a Support in Life.


1     Religion can assuage
      The tempest of the soul;
    And every fear shall lose its rage
      At her divine control.

2     Through life's bewildered way,
      Her hand unerring leads;
    And o'er the path her heavenly ray
      A cheering lustre sheds.

3     When reason, tired and blind,
      Sinks helpless and afraid,
    Thou blest supporter of the mind,
      How powerful is thine aid!

4     O, let us feel thy power,
      And find thy sweet relief,
    To brighten every gloomy hour
      And soften every grief.




409.              C. M.              Tate & Brady.

The Righteous and the Wicked.


1   How blest is he, who ne'er consents
      By ill advice to walk;
    Nor stands in sinners' ways, nor sits
      Where men profanely talk:

2   But makes the perfect law of God
      His business and delight;
    Devoutly reads therein by day,
      And meditates by night.

3   Like some fair tree, which, fed by streams,
      With timely fruit does bend,
    He still shall flourish, and success
      All his designs attend.

4   Ungodly men, and their attempts,
      No lasting root shall find;
    Untimely blasted, and dispersed
      Like chaff before the wind.




410.              C. M.               Exeter Coll.

The Influence of Habitual Piety.


1   Blest is the man who fears the Lord!
      His well established mind,
    In every varying scene of life,
      Shall true composure find.

2   Oft through the deep and stormy sea
      The heavenly footsteps lie;
    But on a glorious world beyond
      His faith can fix its eye.

3   Though dark his present prospects be,
      And sorrows round him dwell,
    Yet hope can whisper to his soul,
      That all shall issue well.

4   Full in the presence of his God,
      Through every scene he goes;
    And, fearing him, no other fear
      His steadfast bosom knows.




411.              C. M.                     Proud.

The Happiness of a Christian.


1   When true religion gains a place,
      And lives within the mind,
    The sensual life subdued by grace,
      And all the soul refined:

2   The desert blooms in living green,
      Where thorns and briers grew;
    The barren waste is fruitful seen,
      And all the prospect new.

3   O happy Christian, richly blessed!
      What floods of pleasure roll!
    By God and man he stands confessed,
      In dignity of soul.

4   Substantial, pure, his every joy:
      His Maker is his friend;
    The noblest business his employ,
      And happiness his end.




412.          7s. & 8s. M.                Bowring.

"He that walketh uprightly, walketh surely."


1   He who walks in virtue's way,
      Firm and fearless, walketh surely;
    Diligent, while yet 'tis day,
      On he speeds, and speeds securely.

2   Flowers of peace beneath him grow,
      Suns of pleasure brighten o'er him;
    Memory's joys behind him go,
      Hope's sweet angels fly before him.

3   Thus he moves from stage to stage,
      Smiles of earth and heaven attending;
    Softly sinking down in age,
      And at last to death descending.
