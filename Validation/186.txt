separate units. Tornado Six was our fleet's first
integrated operation. The mission succeeded because
we got away without military opposition. I can't
trust that sort of luck to hold. We need to refine
our tactics, based on our experience with the log
depot and that armed transport, and in anticipation
of an early organized response by the UIPS."

Brad appeared uncertain whether to remain or
move on.

"Stand by a moment, Brad."

Drummer resumed recording. Symbols in the
tank flashed off and on too quickly for the eye to
follow, but Drummer was no longer giving them his
attention. He touched a glowing disk on the arm
of his chair, sighed, and leaned back. The view tank
cleared to continue its work unobserved.

"I need a break. Here's what's happening, Brad."

He motioned Brad to a seat alongside his desk.

"Narval was impressed at our success, especially
how we bluffed our way through it. Just as
well we didn't push too hard and force an
eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation. He wants much
more preparation before we get to that point.
I agree, we'll leave that until our next no-notice
inspection."

"Well, we did have a fire fight, of sorts, on the
Sandbox," Brad interjected.

"By itself, much less significant than the raids
we've made on UIPS patrols and shipping. The
Sandbox incident was the ship commander's fault
however one looks at it. By the way," Drummer
grinned. "I suggested to Colonel Hanno that
he chastise the Sandbox's commander about
allowing his people to attack my agents. Lax
discipline, and all that."

Brad laughed, but grimly recalled Rimov's wasted
death. Drummer joined him in the laugh, then
quickly resumed his serious expression. Elbows
on desk, hands clasped, he frowned at Brad.

"In categorizing the Sandbox incident
'insignificant' I do so only in the context of its
effect on objectives and strategy. In another
sense, it was quite important."

"Oh?"

"Narval was pleased with the way you handled
yourself on the Dragon in dealing with Hanno
and Bura."

"How did he find out?"

"Scarf's nature, it seems, made him anxious to
get a verbatim record of everything said in his
presence during Tornado Six. He was wired, and
everything said in his presence was recorded.
Had events gone otherwise, I'm convinced he
would have lifted statements that each of us
made and twisted them to discredit us.

"Putting Scarf in hospital immediately upon return
to base didn't give him the chance to tailor the
transcript. Since he reports directly to Narval,
the recordings were sent to the boss from the
hospital as soon as Scarf was admitted -- routine
security under the circumstances. I heard a short
while ago that Narval spent some time in Scarf's
hospital room. I can only assume he was questioning
Scarf on the unedited recording as well as whatever
he witnessed."

"What happens now?"

"Got a call from Narval's office a short while ago.
Narval wants to meet you. Call his office ASAP
and get a time."

 ##

Narval's stare was long and searching. He ignored
the armed guards standing within effective range
of Brad.

"Sit." Narval pointed to a heavy chair directly in
front of his desk. Straight-backed from flat, hard
seat to shoulder level, extension clamshells from
the upper section of the chair curved forward
sharply to form tapered wings.

Brad sat. The clamshells closed in and stopped
a few centimeters from his temple. Wired pads
extended and touched his skull at several points.
The chair was not comfortable; psychic probes
weren't meant to be.

"Tell me about yourself," Narval leaned back,
inspected his fingers, and then concentrated on
a monitor in the wall behind the chair in which
Brad sat.

"My name is Brad Curtin," Brad began, "and I'm
here with five others to seek sanctuary."

"Tell me about the crimes of which you were
convicted, the Guardian Station prison to which you
were committed, how you organized your escape,
and how it was carried through. You know, of course,
that you're undergoing psychic probe. The probe
compensates for your awareness of its being used
on you; the validity of the findings is not degraded.
I see the monitor from where I sit, so, let's hear
your story."

Brad spoke for fifteen minutes without
interruption. He related the events on his
transport off Luna, the investigation that led
to his trial, his testimony before the Board,
and his arrival at the Guardian Station. Without
hesitation, he swung into the cover scenario that
had been burned deep into his psyche by Ram's
technicians: how he had selected his accomplices,
organized the escape, joined the convoy into the
spunnel, and finally, his arrival on Planet Pluto.

Brad let the embedded scripts flow freely. He
trusted Ram's preparations; his life and the lives
of his companions depended on them. Far more
important, the Sentinels mission demanded it.
Anomalies, he knew, would be sensed immediately,
should he even try to color his recounting of the
personal knowledge and programmed experiences
now deeply embedded in his mind.

Brad stopped talking; the general questions had
been answered. Narval studied the wall monitor
behind Brad, and returned his stare to Brad.

"Let's clear up a few points," he said. "I
understand the ship that you, shall we say,
expropriated for your escape was no more
than a local utility vessel in the Belt. Yet, from
what you say -- and from your ship's log -- your
destination was the rim. Wouldn't you have had a
fuel problem?"

"We thought at first that we would. Our plan,
originally, was to get to a refueling station,
replenish our energy packs, and take it from there.
When we checked our bearings, we discovered that
our coordinates put us within range of a spunnel node
so we headed for that. When we got there, several
convoys were lined up for entry to the Special
Zone. Our ship had UIPS markings and the gateway
was crowded. We managed to get in the lineup and
made it."

Narval glanced at the monitor.

"I see. Now, the Guardian Station prison, I am
informed, keeps tabs on its inmates using a
sophisticated surveillance system. How did you
manage to evade observation long enough to get
away?"

"Zolan, a member of our group is an
expert in electronic countermeasures,
counter-countermeasures, and so on. The system
on the Guardian Station was installed two to three
centuries ago. It serves fine, I suppose, for the
ordinary run of inmates confined on the station.
Zolan devised a screen behind which we did our
planning and preparations. When we were ready to
go, he rammed both a counter and a counter-counter
device into the station's sensors. The double
whammy confused the hell out of the system
long enough for us to make our getaway."

"That's my next question. It seems to me the
Space Guard should have been after you immediately.
How is it they let you get away?"

"I think I owe you the credit for that."

"Me?"

"That's the way I figure it. The Guard needs a
minimum number of ships to do its work in the Inner
Region space lanes. Those lanes are so crowded that
they need every ship they can muster to maintain
order. On that I speak from long and bitter
personal experience. Since the secession, many
more Guard vessels are needed along the Belt
and their overlap into the Jovian Void; at best
they're thinly spread.

"Because of the threat to Slingshot that they
perceive in you, the UIPS has been draining both
groups lately to augment patrols along routes
through the Outer Region that converge on the
Special Zone. The additional ships are from the
Belt patrols. With all that they already have to
cover, expending vital resources to chase a few
escaped convicts just wasn't worth it."

Narval wheezed a chuckle.

"So, you think you are beholden to me for this
indirect assistance. Really feel that way?"

As he asked the question he looked intently at
the monitor. Brad, in turn, watched Narval's eyes.

"I can't see it any other way, Mr. President."

Narval grinned.

"Your answers to my questions present an
interesting scenario," Narval said after studying
the monitor. "The probe, by the way, does not
indicate significant deviations from the facts --
as you understand them, of course."

Narval waved the guards away. Saluting, they left
the room, closing the door softly behind them.
Narval motioned Brad to a chair of much gentler
design alongside his desk. As Brad exchanged seats
Narval swiveled his chair to face him. He leaned
forward and grasped Brad's wrist in a puffy grip.

"The interrogation is over," he said. "This little
session with the probe, along with voice analyses
of you and your associates has, up to now, failed
to disclose a threat to me or about what you all
now know of my plans and military capabilities.
You seem to be what you claim. Nevertheless,
you remain under scrutiny."

Brad shrugged and remained silent; his features
reflected that he expected no less.

Narval's smile was vapid, metallic.

"I commend you for the manner in which you
represented Drummer and, I add, myself. You did
well with the log depot Commander and that upstart
on the transport. I am especially pleased with the
way you conducted yourself in that little squabble
on the transport."

"Thank you, Mr. President."

"Now, to more important matters, Brad."

Narval leaned back in his deeply cushioned chair
and tented his stubby fingers.

"Your observations on the deployment of UIPS
military forces interests me. It supports my
suspicions. The Inner Region's internal Space Guard
is constabulary in both organization and mission.
Their jurisdiction is confined by the UIPS borders.
Their Military Space Force, on the other hand, has
a charter to roam the Solar System -- comparable
to ancient laws ensuring open seas and oceans.

"Transfer of fighter craft and pilots from the UIPS
Space Guard to the Military Space Force, I suspect,
is now taking place. Many will need to be refitted
for long range operations, and their crews trained
in military concepts and tactics in place of those
employed in local constabulary duties."

Narval twisted the rings on his fingers, and his
tiny eyes seemed to sink deeper into surrounding
flesh.

"The greatest single concern of the UIPS is the
integrity of Slingshot and the Special Zone. I am
convinced that the UIPS military forces, once they
attain optimum strength, will attempt to crush me,
or at the least, dominate the Zone.

"We must prepare to withstand, to resist, and
to triumph over this UIPS aggression in the Outer
Region."

Brad felt Narval's eyes on him.

"You are going to help me to prepare," Narval said.





 Chapter TWENTY-TWO


Drummer expected the call.

"Drummer," Narval said as the door closed behind
the guard and they were alone, "UIPS perception of
me as a threat can be as effective a weapon as my
transforming the threat into the deed itself."

Drummer chose caution. "How so, Mr. President?"

Narval peered sharply at Drummer as he leaned his
heavy body back, and folded ring-encrusted hands
across his paunch. He shifted his gaze to the
ceiling and half-closed his eyes.

"The UIPS now perceives us as having demonstrated
a capability for military actions against their
vital interests. If we follow up with threats and
menacing gestures against Slingshot, the effect may
unnerve them, to say the least. How do you see it?"

"It seems to me we've gone far beyond mere
threats," Drummer's tone, now grim, continued.
"Raiding and harassing their transports, attacking
and destroying UIPS patrollers in the Zone, and
now, the inventory tax. We formally notify them by
Proclamation that we'll lay siege to the Log Depot,
we've boarded one of their armed transports and
disabled its armaments. These are not empty
threats and impetuous gestures."

"Even so, they are prologue, Drummer. Hear me."

Narval twisted his rings, first in one direction
then opposite. Lowering his eyes to his hands, he
paused often between words, choosing them with care.

"Here in the Outer Region, the separate nations
are convulsed by internal struggles for power both
internal to their sovereignty and within the family
of independent satellites that orbit their host
planet. Their political philosophies are diverse,
lack cohesion, and have powerful advocates or
opponents, some openly, others covert. The Heads
of State are insecure and fear political coups.
Rapid changes in leadership cannot be ruled out."

Drummer watched Narval eyes caress his entwined
fingers.

"If new leaders arise and take over the reins of
power from incumbents, so much the better for
me. New governments will need time to become
entrenched, create lines of authority and
accountability, and install bureaucracies
responsive to the wishes of a new elite. I repeat,
confusion in the ranks, within other governments,
is to my advantage."

"Can you count on such events materializing?"

"Of course not."

Narval wagged a finger at Drummer.

"But the uncertainty within regimes that these
disruptions can, and may occur, dissipates and
weakens their energies. If they fear enemies from
within, and suspect enemies from outside, then
they are diseased and warrant being replaced by
a daring and skillful master."

"Who might that be?"

"Me."

"I'm not sure I understand."

"Then listen carefully, because you play a vital
role in my plans."

Narval motioned a now openly apprehensive Drummer
to the chair beside his desk. As Drummer sat,
Narval leaned close.

"My strategy has two facets: one involves INOR,
the other, the UIPS. They are interdependent."

Unfolding his clasped hands, Narval's fingers
drummed the desk.

"I repeat, with INOR in turmoil no head of state
can feel secure. New philosophies surface and
attract supporters, occasionally, even strong
leaders. If forces with objectives opposing mine
move into the Outer Region, I will not sit by idly.
I will intervene, even if it means imposing the
most stringent discipline and controls."

"With respect, President Narval, does Planet Pluto
have the right to intervene into the affairs of
other nations?"

Narval scowled, recovered, and snickered.

"Power gives us rights we would not have otherwise.
When the old United Planetary System decided to
use Planet Pluto as the forward base for Slingshot,
they invested the planet with some of their most
advanced technologies. Other communities throughout
the Outer Region are just that: places where people
live, work, play, consume and little else.

"Slingshot has given Planet Pluto a far greater
role in the solar scheme. And now, a role that
was entirely unexpected when Slingshot was
first planned, dissolution of the unified solar
government released us from UIPS domination. We
gained opportunities to fashion and strengthen an
infrastructure, and freedom to confuse our INOR
neighbors with a melange of schemes to satisfy
their greed. Slingshot technology, facilities, and
materiel give to us, more than to any other member
of INOR, the means to attain our aspirations. Power
creates its own logic, Drummer.

"To answer your question: I will intervene into the
affairs of other nations when it is to my benefit
to do so."

Narval's hands clenched into fists. He pounded the
top of his desk in a tattoo as he glared at Drummer
through eye slits embedded in fat.

"Understand me, Drummer," Narval shrilled. "I will
be the dominant force in INOR, and that's only the
beginning."

Narval quieted, each warily observing the other.
Hesitatingly, Drummer tried to respond to Narval's
incredible declaration.

"Is that what's behind your recent Proclamation
to the UIPS on a new foundation for interregional
relationships?"

"Partly."

"What else is there?"
