But I'll ever faithful be,
  True to Bobby Shaftoe."

"Darling, I've come home from sea,
I've come back to marry thee,
For I know you're true to me,
  True to Bobby Shaftoe."

"Yes, I always cared for thee,
And now you've come back to me,
And we will always happy be,
  Dearest Bobby Shaftoe."

"Bobby Shaftoe's come from sea,
And we will united be,
Heart and hand in unity,
  Mr. and Mrs. Shaftoe."




The Overworked Elocutionist

(Or "ROBERT REESE")


Once there was a little boy
  Whose name was Robert Reese,
And every Friday afternoon
  He had to speak a piece.

So many poems thus he learned
  That soon he had a store
Of recitations in his head
  And still kept learning more.

Now this it is what happened:
  He was called upon one week
And totally forgot the piece
  He was about to speak.

His brain he vainly cudgeled
  But no word was in his head,
And so he spoke at random,
  And this is what he said;

My beautiful, my beautiful,
  Who standest proudly by,
It was the schooner Hesperus
  The breaking waves dashed high.

Why is the Forum crowded?
  What means this stir in Rome?
Under a spreading chestnut tree
  There is no place like home.

When Freedom from her mountain height
  Cried, "Twinkle, little star,"
Shoot if you must this old gray head,
  King Henry of Navarre.

If you're waking, call me early
  To be or not to be,
Curfew must not ring to-night,
  Oh, woodman, spare that tree.

Charge, Chester, Charge! On, Stanley, on!
  And let who will be clever,
The boy stood on the burning deck
  But I go on for ever.




The Kid Has Gone to the Colors


The Kid has gone to the Colors
  And we don't know what to say;
The Kid we have loved and cuddled
  Stepped out for the Flag to-day.
We thought him a child, a baby
  With never a care at all,
But his country called him man-size
  And the Kid has heard the call.

He paused to watch the recruiting,
  Where, fired by the fife and drum,
He bowed his head to Old Glory
  And thought that it whispered: "Come!"
The Kid, not being a slacker,
  Stood forth with patriot-joy
To add his name to the roster--
  And God, we're proud of the boy!

The Kid has gone to the Colors;
  It seems but a little while
Since he drilled a schoolboy army
  In a truly martial style,
But now he's a man, a soldier,
  And we lend him a listening ear,
For his heart is a heart all loyal,
  Unscourged by the curse of fear.

His dad, when he told him, shuddered,
  His mother--God bless her!--cried;
Yet, blest with a mother-nature,
  She wept with a mother-pride,
But he whose old shoulders straightened
  Was Granddad--for memory ran
To years when he, too, a youngster,
  Was changed by the Flag to a man!

Kentucky Belle


Summer of 'sixty-three, sir, and Conrad was gone away--
Gone to the county-town, sir, to sell our first load of hay--
We lived in the log house yonder, poor as ever you've seen;
Roschen there was a baby, and I was only nineteen.

Conrad, he took the oxen, but he left Kentucky Belle.
How much we thought of Kentuck, I couldn't begin to tell--
Came from the Blue-Grass country; my father gave her to me
When I rode north with Conrad, away from the Tennessee.

Conrad lived in Ohio--a German he is, you know--
The house stood in broad cornfields, stretching on, row after row.
The old folks made me welcome; they were kind as kind could be;
But I kept longing, longing, for the hills of the Tennessee.

Oh, for a sight of water, the shadowed slope of a hill!
Clouds that hang on the summit, a wind that never is still!
But the level land went stretching away to meet the sky--
Never a rise, from north to south, to rest the weary eye!

From east to west, no river to shine out under the moon,
Nothing to make a shadow in the yellow afternoon:
Only the breathless sunshine, as I looked out, all forlorn;
Only the rustle, rustle, as I walked among the corn.

When I fell sick with pining, we didn't wait any more,
But moved away from the cornlands, out to this river shore--
The Tuscarawas it's called, sir--off there's a hill, you see--
And now I've grown to like it next best to the Tennessee.

I was at work that morning. Some one came riding like mad
Over the bridge and up the road--Farmer Rouf's little lad.
Bareback he rode; he had no hat; he hardly stopped to say,
"Morgan's men are coming, Frau; they're galloping on this way.

"I'm sent to warn the neighbors. He isn't a mile behind;
He sweeps up all the horses--every horse that he can find.
Morgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan's terrible men,
With bowie knives and pistols, are galloping up the glen!"

The lad rode down the valley, and I stood still at the door;
The baby laughed and prattled, playing with spools on the floor;
Kentuck was out in the pasture; Conrad, my man, was gone.
Nearer, nearer, Morgan's men were galloping, galloping on!

Sudden I picked up baby, and ran to the pasture bar.
"Kentuck!" I called--"Kentucky!" She knew me ever so far!
I led her down the gully that turns off there to the right,
And tied her to the bushes; her head was just out of sight.

As I ran back to the log house, at once there came a sound--
The ring of hoofs, galloping hoofs, trembling over the ground--
Coming into the turnpike out from the White Woman Glen--
Morgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan's terrible men.

As near they drew and nearer, my heart beat fast in alarm;
But still I stood in the doorway with baby on my arm.
They came, they passed; with spur and whip in haste they sped along--
Morgan, Morgan the raider, and his band, six hundred strong.

Weary they looked and jaded, riding through night and through day;
Pushing on east to the river, many long miles away,
To the border strip where Virginia runs up into the West,
And fording the Upper Ohio before they could stop to rest.

On like the wind they hurried, and Morgan rode in advance;
Bright were his eyes like live coals, as he gave me a sideways glance.
And I was just breathing freely, after my choking pain,
When the last one of the troopers suddenly drew his rein.

Frightened I was to death, sir; I scarce dared look in his face,
As he asked for a drink of water, and glanced around the place.
I gave him a cup, and he smiled--'twas only a boy, you see;
Faint and worn, with dim blue eyes; and he'd sailed on the Tennessee.

Only sixteen he was, sir--a fond mother's only son--
Off and away with Morgan before his life had begun!
The damp drops stood on his temples; drawn was the boyish mouth;
And I thought me of the mother waiting down in the South.

Oh! pluck was he to the backbone, and clear grit through and through;
Boasted and bragged like a trooper; but the big words wouldn't do;--
The boy was dying, sir, dying as plain as plain could be,
Worn out by his ride with Morgan up from the Tennessee.

But when I told the laddie that I too was from the South,
Water came in his dim eyes, and quivers around his mouth.
"Do you know the Blue-Grass country?" he wistful began to say;
Then swayed like a willow sapling, and fainted dead away.

I had him into the log house, and worked and brought him to;
I fed him, and I coaxed him, as I thought his mother'd do;
And when the lad got better, and the noise in his head was gone,
Morgan's men--were miles; away, galloping, galloping on.

"Oh, I must go," he muttered; "I must be up and away!
Morgan--Morgan is waiting for me; Oh, what will Morgan say?"
But I heard a sound of tramping and kept him back from the door--
The ringing sound of horses' hoofs that I had heard before.

And on, on, came the soldiers--the Michigan cavalry--
And fast they rode, and black they looked, galloping rapidly,--
They had followed hard on Morgan's track; they had followed day and night;
But of Morgan and Morgan's raiders they had never caught a sight.

And rich Ohio sat startled through all those summer days;
For strange, wild men were galloping over her broad highways--
Now here, now there, now seen, now gone, now north, now east, now west,
Through river-valleys and cornland farms, sweeping away her best.

A bold ride and a long ride; but they were taken at last.
They almost reached the river by galloping hard and fast;
But the boys in blue were upon them ere ever they gained the ford,
And Morgan, Morgan the raider, laid down his terrible sword.

Well, I kept the boy till evening--kept him against his will--
But he was too weak to follow, and sat there pale and still.
When it was cool and dusky--you'll wonder to hear me tell--
But I stole down to that gully, and brought up Kentucky Belle.

I kissed the star on her forehead--my pretty gentle lass--
But I knew that she'd be happy back in the old Blue-Grass.
A suit of clothes of Conrad's, with all the money I had,
And Kentuck, pretty Kentuck, I gave to the worn-out lad.

I guided him to the southward as well as I know how;
The boy rode off with many thanks, and many a backward bow;
And then the glow it faded, and my heart began to swell,
As down the glen away she went, my lost Kentucky Belle!

When Conrad came in the evening, the moon was shining high;
Baby and I were both crying--I couldn't tell him why--
But a battered suit of rebel gray was hanging on the wall,
And a thin old horse, with drooping head, stood in Kentucky's stall.

Well, he was kind, and never once said a hard word to me;
He knew I couldn't help it--'twas all for the Tennessee,
But, after the war was over, just think what came to pass--
A letter, sir; and the two were safe back in the old Blue-Grass.

The lad had got across the border, riding Kentucky Belle;
And Kentuck, she was thriving, and fat, and hearty, and well;
He cared for her, and kept her, nor touched her with whip or spur.
Ah! we've had many horses since, but never a horse like her!

An Inventor's Wife


I remember it all so very well, the first of my married life,
  That I can't believe it was years ago--it doesn't seem true at all;
Why, I just can see the little church where they made us man and wife,
  And the merry glow of the first wood-fire that danced on our cottage
          wall.

_We were happy?_ Yes; and we prospered, too; the house belonged
          to Joe,
  And then, he worked in the planing mill, and drew the best of pay;
And our cup was full when Joey came,--our baby-boy, you know;
  So, all went well till that mill burned down and the owner moved away.

It wasn't long till Joe found work, but 'twas never quite the same,--
  Never steady, with smaller pay; so to make the two ends meet
He fell to inventin' some machine--I don't recall the name,
  But he'd sit for hours in his little shop that opens toward the
          street,--

Sit for hours, bent over his work, his tools all strewn about.
  I used to want to go in there to dust and sweep the floor,
But 'twas just as if 'twas the parson there, writing his sermon out;
  Even the baby--bless the child!--learned never to slam that door!

People called him a clever man, and folks from the city came
  To look at his new invention and wish my Joe success;
And Joe would say, "Little woman,"--for that was my old pet-name,--
  "If my plan succeeds, you shall have a coach and pair, and a fine silk
          dress!"

I didn't want 'em, the grand new things, but it made the big tears start
  To see my Joe with his restless eyes, his fingers worn away
To the skin and bone, for he wouldn't eat; and it almost broke my heart
  When he tossed at night from side to side, till the dawning of the day.

Of course, with it all he lost his place. I couldn't blame the man,
  The foreman there at the factory, for losing faith in Joe,
For his mind was never upon his work, but on some invention-plan,
  As with folded arms and his head bent down he wandered to and fro.

Yet, he kept on workin' at various things, till our little money went
  For wheels and screws and metal casts and things I had never seen;
And I ceased to ask, "Any pay, my dear?" with the answer, "Not a cent!"
  When his lock and his patent-saw had failed, he clung to that great
          machine.

I remember one special thing that year. He had bought some costly tool,
  When we wanted our boy to learn to read--he was five years old, you
          know;
He went to his class with cold, bare feet, till at last he came from
          school
  And gravely said, "Don't send me back; the children tease me so!"

I hadn't the heart to cross the child, so, while I sat and sewed
  He would rock his little sister in the cradle at my side;
And when the struggle was hardest and I felt keen hunger's goad
  Driving me almost to despair--the little baby died.

Her father came to the cradle-side, as she lay, so small and white;
  "Maggie," he said, "I have killed this child, and now I am killing you!
I swear by heaven, I will give it up!" Yet, like a thief, that night
  He stole to the shop and worked; his brow all wet with a clammy dew.

I cannot tell how I lived that week, my little boy and I,
  Too proud to beg; too weak to work; and the weather cold and wild.
I can only think of one dark night when the rain poured from the sky,
  And the wind went wailing round the house, like the ghost of my buried
          child.

Joe still toiled in the little shop. Somebody clicked the gate;
  A neighbor-lad brought in the mail and laid it on the floor,
But I sat half-stunned by my heavy grief crouched over the empty grate,
  Till I heard--the crack of a pistol-shot; and I sprang to the workshop
          door.

That door was locked and the bolt shut fast. I could not cry, nor speak,
  But I snatched my boy from the corner there, sick with a sudden dread,
And carried him out through the garden plot, forgetting my arms were weak,
  Forgetting the rainy torrent that beat on my bare young head;

The front door yielded to my touch. I staggered faintly in,
  Fearing--_what_? He stood unharmed, though the wall showed a
          jagged hole.
In his trembling hand, his aim had failed, and the great and deadly sin
  Of his own life's blood was not yet laid on the poor man's tortured soul.

But the pistol held another charge, I knew; and like something mad
  I shook my fist in my poor man's face, and shrieked at him, fierce and
          wild,
"How can you dare to rob us so?"--and I seized the little lad;
  "How can you dare to rob your wife and your little helpless child?"

All of a sudden, he bowed his head, while from his nerveless hand
  That hung so limp, I almost feared to see the pistol fall.
"Maggie," he said in a low, low voice, "you see me as I stand
  A hopeless man. My plan has failed. That letter tells you all."

Then for a moment the house was still as ever the house of death;
  Only the drip of the rain outside, for the storm was almost o'er;
But no;--there followed another sound, and I started, caught my breath;
  As a stalwart man with a heavy step came in at the open door.

I shall always think him an angel sent from heaven in a human guise;
  He must have guessed our awful state; he couldn't help but see
There was something wrong; but never a word, never a look in his eyes
  Told what he thought, as in kindly way he talked to Joe and me.

He was come from a thriving city firm, and they'd sent him here to say
  That _one_ of Joe's inventions was a great, successful thing;
And which do you think? His window-catch that he'd tinkered up one day;
  And we were to have a good per cent on the sum that each would bring.

And then the pleasant stranger went, and we wakened as from a dream.
  My man bent down his head and said, "Little woman, you've saved my life!"
The worn look gone from his dear gray eyes, and in its place, a gleam
  From the sun that has shone so brightly since, on Joe and his happy
          wife!

The Two Glasses


There sat two glasses filled to the brim
On a rich man's table, rim to rim,
One was ruddy and red as blood,
And one was clear as the crystal flood.

Said the Glass of Wine to his paler brother:
"Let us tell tales of the past to each other;
I can tell of banquet and revel and mirth,
Where I was king, for I ruled in might;
For the proudest and grandest souls of earth
Fell under my touch, as though struck with blight.
From the heads of kings I have torn the crown;
From the heights of fame I have hurled men down.
I have blasted many an honored name;
I have taken virtue and given shame;
I have tempted youth with a sip, a taste,
That has made his future a barren waste.
Far greater than any king am I,
Or than any army beneath the sky.
I have made the arm of the driver fail,
And sent the train from the iron rail.
I have made good ships go down at sea.
And the shrieks of the lost were sweet to me.
Fame, strength, wealth, genius before me fall;
And my might and power are over all!
Ho, ho, pale brother," said the Wine,
"Can you boast of deeds as great as mine?"

Said the Water Glass: "I cannot boast
Of a king dethroned, or a murdered host;
But I can tell of hearts that were sad,
By my crystal drops made bright and glad;
Of thirsts I have quenched and brows I have laved,
Of hands I have cooled, and souls I have saved.
I have leaped through the valley, dashed down the mountain,
Slipped from the sunshine, and dripped from the fountain,
I have burst my cloud-fetters, and dropped from the sky,
And everywhere gladdened the prospect and eye;
I have eased the hot forehead of fever and pain,
I have made the parched meadows grow fertile with grain.
I can tell of the powerful wheel of the mill,
That ground out the flour, and turned at my will.
I can tell of manhood debased by you
That I have uplifted and crowned anew;
I cheer, I help, I strengthen and aid,
I gladden the heart of man and maid;
I set the wine-chained captive free,
And all are better for knowing me."

These are the tales they told each other,
The Glass of Wine, and its paler brother,
As they sat together, filled to the brim,
On a rich man's table, rim to rim.

Abraham Lincoln

(_Written after Lincoln's death by Tom Taylor, famous cartoonist of the
London "Punch."_)


_You_ lay a wreath on murdered Lincoln's bier!
  _You_, who with mocking pencil wont to trace,
Broad for the self-complacent British sneer,
  His length of shambling limb, his furrowed face,

His gaunt, gnarled hands, his unkempt, bristling hair,
  His garb uncouth, his bearing ill at ease,
His lack of all we prize as debonair,
  Of power or will to shine, of art to please!

_You_, whose smart pen backed up the pencil's laugh,
  Judging each step, as though the way were plain;
Reckless, so it could point its paragraph,
  Of chief's perplexity, or people's pain!

Beside this corpse, that bears for winding-sheet
  The Stars and Stripes he lived to rear anew,
Between the mourners at his head and feet--
  Say, scurril jester, is there room for you?

Yes, he had lived to shame me from my sneer--
  To lame my pencil and confute my pen--
To make me own this hind, of princes peer,
  This rail-splitter, a true-born king of men.

My shallow judgment I had learned to rue,
  Noting how to occasion's height he rose;
How his quaint wit made home-truth seem more true,
  How, iron-like, his temper grew by blows;

How humble, yet how hopeful he could be;
  How in good fortune and in ill the same;
Nor bitter in success, nor boastful he,
  Thirsty for gold, nor feverish for fame.

He went about his work--such work as few
  Ever had laid on head, and heart, and hand--
As one who knows where there's a task to do,
  Man's honest will must Heaven's good grace command;

Who trusts the strength will with the burden grow,
  That God makes instruments to work His will,
If but that will we can arrive to know,
  Nor tamper with the weights of good and ill.

So he went forth to battle, on the side
  That he felt clear was Liberty's and Right's,
As in his peasant boyhood he had plied
  His warfare with rude nature's thwarting mights;--

The uncleared forest, the unbroken soil,
  The iron bark that turns the lumberer's axe,
The rapid, that o'erbears the boatman's toil,
  The prairie, hiding the mazed wanderer's tracks,

The ambushed Indian and the prowling bear--
  Such were the needs that helped his youth to train:
Rough culture--but such trees large fruit may bear,
  If but their stocks be of right girth and grain.

So he grew up, a destined work to do,
  And lived to do it: four long, suffering years
Ill-fate, ill-feeling, ill-report, lived through,
  And then he heard the hisses change to cheers,

The taunts to tribute, the abuse to praise,
  And took both with the same unwavering mood;
Till, as he came on light, from darkling days,
