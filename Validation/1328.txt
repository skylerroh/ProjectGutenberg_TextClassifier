and two other girls who were with her, were carried off by a band of
Indians. Boone raised some friends and followed the trail steadily for
two days and a night; then they came to where the Indians had killed a
buffalo calf and were camped around it. Firing from a little distance,
the whites shot two of the Indians, and, rushing in, rescued the girls.
On another occasion, when Boone had gone to visit a salt-lick with his
brother, the Indians ambushed them and shot the latter. Boone himself
escaped, but the Indians followed him for three miles by the aid of
a tracking dog, until Boone turned, shot the dog, and then eluded his
pursuers. In company with Simon Kenton and many other noted hunters and
wilderness warriors, he once and again took part in expeditions into the
Indian country, where they killed the braves and drove off the horses.
Twice bands of Indians, accompanied by French, Tory, and British
partizans from Detroit, bearing the flag of Great Britain, attacked
Boonesboroug. In each case Boone and his fellow-settlers beat them off
with loss. At the fatal battle of the Blue Licks, in which two hundred
of the best riflemen of Kentucky were beaten with terrible slaughter by
a great force of Indians from the lakes, Boone commanded the left wing.
Leading his men, rifle in hand, he pushed back and overthrew the force
against him; but meanwhile the Indians destroyed the right wing and
center, and got round in his rear, so that there was nothing left for
Boone's men except to flee with all possible speed.

As Kentucky became settled, Boone grew restless and ill at ease.
He loved the wilderness; he loved the great forests and the great
prairie-like glades, and the life in the little lonely cabin, where from
the door he could see the deer come out into the clearing at nightfall.
The neighborhood of his own kind made him feel cramped and ill at ease.
So he moved ever westward with the frontier; and as Kentucky filled up
he crossed the Mississippi and settled on the borders of the prairie
country of Missouri, where the Spaniards, who ruled the territory, made
him an alcalde, or judge. He lived to a great age, and died out on the
border, a backwoods hunter to the last.




GEORGE ROGERS CLARK AND THE CONQUEST OF THE NORTHWEST

   Have the elder races halted?
   Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied over there beyond the

   We take up the task eternal, and the burden and the lesson,
    Pioneers! O Pioneers!
    All the past we leave behind,
   We debouch upon a newer, mightier world, varied world;

   Fresh and strong the world we seize, world of labor and the
   march,
    Pioneers! O Pioneers!
   We detachments steady throwing,
   Down the edges, through the passes, up the mountains steep,
   Conquering, holding, daring, venturing, as we go the unknown
   ways,
    Pioneers! O Pioneers!

In 1776, when independence was declared, the United States included only
the thirteen original States on the seaboard. With the exception of a
few hunters there were no white men west of the Alleghany Mountains, and
there was not even an American hunter in the great country out of which
we have since made the States of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and
Wisconsin. All this region north of the Ohio River then formed apart
of the Province of Quebec. It was a wilderness of forests and prairies,
teeming with game, and inhabited by many warlike tribes of Indians.

Here and there through it were dotted quaint little towns of French
Creoles, the most important being Detroit, Vincennes on the Wabash, and
Kaskaskia and Kahokia on the Illinois. These French villages were ruled
by British officers commanding small bodies of regular soldiers or Tory
rangers and Creole partizans. The towns were completely in the power
of the British government; none of the American States had actual
possession of a foot of property in the Northwestern Territory.

The Northwest was acquired in the midst of the Revolution only by armed
conquest, and if it had not been so acquired, it would have remained a
part of the British Dominion of Canada.

The man to whom this conquest was clue was a famous backwoods leader,
a mighty hunter, a noted Indian-fighter, George Rogers Clark. He was a
very strong man, with light hair and blue eyes. He was of good Virginian
family. Early in his youth, he embarked on the adventurous career of
a backwoods surveyor, exactly as Washington and so many other young
Virginians of spirit did at that period. He traveled out to Kentucky
soon after it was founded by Boone, and lived there for a year, either
at the stations or camping by him self in the woods, surveying, hunting,
and making war against the Indians like any other settler; but all the
time his mind was bent on vaster schemes than were dreamed of by the
men around him. He had his spies out in the Northwestern Territory, and
became convinced that with a small force of resolute backwoodsmen he
could conquer it for the United States. When he went back to Virginia,
Governor Patrick Henry entered heartily into Clark's schemes and gave
him authority to fit out a force for his purpose.

In 1778, after encountering endless difficulties and delays, he finally
raised a hundred and fifty backwoods riflemen. In May they started down
the Ohio in flatboats to undertake the allotted task. They drifted and
rowed downstream to the Falls of the Ohio, where Clark founded a log
hamlet, which has since become the great city of Louisville.

Here he halted for some days and was joined by fifty or sixty
volunteers; but a number of the men deserted, and when, after an eclipse
of the sun, Clark again pushed off to go down with the current, his
force was but about one hundred and sixty riflemen. All, however, were
men on whom he could depend--men well used to frontier warfare. They
were tall, stalwart backwoodsmen, clad in the hunting-shirt and leggings
that formed the national dress of their kind, and armed with the
distinctive weapon of the backwoods, the long-barreled, small-bore
rifle.

Before reaching the Mississippi the little flotilla landed, and Clark
led his men northward against the Illinois towns. In one of them,
Kaskaskia, dwelt the British commander of the entire district up to
Detroit. The small garrison and the Creole militia taken together
outnumbered Clark's force, and they were in close alliance with the
Indians roundabout. Clark was anxious to take the town by surprise and
avoid bloodshed, as he believed he could win over the Creoles to the
American side. Marching cautiously by night and generally hiding by day,
he came to the outskirts of the little village on the evening of July 4,
and lay in the woods near by until after nightfall.

Fortune favored him. That evening the officers of the garrison had
given a great ball to the mirth-loving Creoles, and almost the entire
population of the village had gathered in the fort, where the dance
was held. While the revelry was at its height, Clark and his tall
backwoodsmen, treading silently through the darkness, came into the
town, surprised the sentries, and surrounded the fort without causing
any alarm.

All the British and French capable of bearing arms were gathered in the
fort to take part in or look on at the merrymaking. When his men were
posted Clark walked boldly forward through the open door, and, leaning
against the wall, looked at the dancers as they whirled around in the
light of the flaring torches. For some moments no one noticed him.
Then an Indian who had been lying with his chin on his hand, looking
carefully over the gaunt figure of the stranger, sprang to his feet, and
uttered the wild war-whoop. Immediately the dancing ceased and the men
ran to and fro in confusion; but Clark, stepping forward, bade them be
at their ease, but to remember that henceforth they danced under the
flag of the United States, and not under that of Great Britain.

The surprise was complete, and no resistance was attempted. For
twenty-four hours the Creoles were in abject terror. Then Clark summoned
their chief men together and explained that he came as their ally, and
not as their foe, and that if they would join with him they should be
citizens of the American republic, and treated in all respects on
an equality with their comrades. The Creoles, caring little for the
British, and rather fickle of nature, accepted the proposition with joy,
and with the most enthusiastic loyalty toward Clark. Not only that, but
sending messengers to their kinsmen on the Wabash, they persuaded the
people of Vincennes likewise to cast off their allegiance to the British
king, and to hoist the American flag.

So far, Clark had conquered with greater ease than he had dared to hope.
But when the news reached the British governor, Hamilton, at Detroit,
he at once prepared to reconquer the land. He had much greater forces at
his command than Clark had; and in the fall of that year he came down to
Vincennes by stream and portage, in a great fleet of canoes bearing five
hundred fighting men-British regulars, French partizans, and Indians.
The Vincennes Creoles refused to fight against the British, and the
American officer who had been sent thither by Clark had no alternative
but to surrender.

If Hamilton had then pushed on and struck Clark in Illinois, having
more than treble Clark's force, he could hardly have failed to win the
victory; but the season was late and the journey so difficult that he
did not believe it could be taken. Accordingly he disbanded the Indians
and sent some of his troops back to Detroit, announcing that when spring
came he would march against Clark in Illinois.

If Clark in turn had awaited the blow he would have surely met defeat;
but he was a greater man than his antagonist, and he did what the other
deemed impossible.

Finding that Hamilton had sent home some of his troops and dispersed
all his Indians, Clark realized that his chance was to strike before
Hamilton's soldiers assembled again in the spring. Accordingly he
gathered together the pick of his men, together with a few Creoles, one
hundred and seventy all told, and set out for Vincennes. At first the
journey was easy enough, for they passed across the snowy Illinois
prairies, broken by great reaches of lofty woods. They killed elk,
buffalo, and deer for food, there being no difficulty in getting all
they wanted to eat; and at night they built huge fires by which to
sleep, and feasted "like Indian war-dancers," as Clark said in his
report.

But when, in the middle of February, they reached the drowned lands of
the Wabash, where the ice had just broken up and everything was flooded,
the difficulties seemed almost insuperable, and the march became painful
and laborious to a degree. All day long the troops waded in the icy
water, and at night they could with difficulty find some little hillock
on which to sleep. Only Clark's indomitable courage and cheerfulness
kept the party in heart and enabled them to persevere. However,
persevere they did, and at last, on February 23, they came in sight
of the town of Vincennes. They captured a Creole who was out shooting
ducks, and from him learned that their approach was utterly unsuspected,
and that there were many Indians in town.

Clark was now in some doubt as to how to make his fight. The British
regulars dwelt in a small fort at one end of the town, where they had
two light guns; but Clark feared lest, if he made a sudden night attack,
the townspeople and Indians would from sheer fright turn against him. He
accordingly arranged, just before he himself marched in, to send in the
captured duck-hunter, conveying a warning to the Indians and the Creoles
that he was about to attack the town, but that his only quarrel was with
the British, and that if the other inhabitants would stay in their own
homes they would not be molested. Sending the duck-hunter ahead, Clark
took up his march and entered the town just after nightfall. The news
conveyed by the released hunter astounded the townspeople, and they
talked it over eagerly, and were in doubt what to do. The Indians, not
knowing how great might be the force that would assail the town, at once
took refuge in the neighboring woods, while the Creoles retired to their
own houses. The British knew nothing of what had happened until the
Americans had actually entered the streets of the little village.
Rushing forward, Clark's men soon penned the regulars within their
fort, where they kept them surrounded all night. The next day a party
of Indian warriors, who in the British interest had been ravaging the
settlements of Kentucky, arrived and entered the town, ignorant that
the Americans had captured it. Marching boldly forward to the fort,
they suddenly found it beleaguered, and before they could flee they were
seized by the backwoodsmen. In their belts they carried the scalps of
the slain settlers. The savages were taken redhanded, and the American
frontiersmen were in no mood to show mercy. All the Indians were
tomahawked in sight of the fort.

For some time the British defended themselves well; but at length their
guns were disabled, all of the gunners being picked off by the backwoods
marksmen, and finally the garrison dared not so much as appear at a
port-hole, so deadly was the fire from the long rifles. Under such
circumstances Hamilton was forced to surrender.

No attempt was afterward made to molest the Americans in the land they
had won, and upon the conclusion of peace the Northwest, which had been
conquered by Clark, became part of the United States.




THE BATTLE OF TRENTON

     And such they are--and such they will be found:
     Not so Leonidas and Washington,
     Their every battle-field is holy ground
     Which breathes of nations saved, not worlds undone.
     How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!
     While the mere victor's may appal or stun
     The servile and the vain, such names will be
     A watchword till the future shall be free.
                        --Byron.


In December, 1776, the American Revolution was at its lowest ebb. The
first burst of enthusiasm, which drove the British back from Concord
and met them hand to hand at Bunker Hill, which forced them to abandon
Boston and repulsed their attack at Charleston, had spent its force. The
undisciplined American forces called suddenly from the workshop and the
farm had given way, under the strain of a prolonged contest, and had
been greatly scattered, many of the soldiers returning to their homes.
The power of England, on the other hand, with her disciplined army and
abundant resources, had begun to tell. Washington, fighting stubbornly,
had been driven during the summer and autumn from Long Island up the
Hudson, and New York had passed into the hands of the British. Then
Forts Lee and Washington had been lost, and finally the Continental army
had retreated to New Jersey. On the second of December Washington was
at Princeton with some three thousand ragged soldiers, and had escaped
destruction only by the rapidity of his movements. By the middle of the
month General Howe felt that the American army, unable as he believed
either to fight or to withstand the winter, must soon dissolve, and,
posting strong detachments at various points, he took up his winter
quarters in New York. The British general had under his command in his
various divisions twenty-five thousand well-disciplined soldiers, and
the conclusion he had reached was not an unreasonable one; everything,
in fact, seemed to confirm his opinion. Thousands of the colonists were
coming in and accepting his amnesty. The American militia had left the
field, and no more would turn out, despite Washington's earnest appeals.
All that remained of the American Revolution was the little Continental
army and the man who led it.

Yet even in this dark hour Washington did not despair. He sent in every
direction for troops. Nothing was forgotten. Nothing that he could do
was left undone. Unceasingly he urged action upon Congress, and at the
same time with indomitable fighting spirit he planned to attack the
British. It was a desperate undertaking in the face of such heavy odds,
for in all his divisions he had only some six thousand men, and even
these were scattered. The single hope was that by his own skill and
courage he could snatch victory from a situation where victory seemed
impossible. With the instinct of a great commander he saw that his only
chance was to fight the British detachments suddenly, unexpectedly,
and separately, and to do this not only required secrecy and perfect
judgment, but also the cool, unwavering courage of which, under such
circumstances, very few men have proved themselves capable. As Christmas
approached his plans were ready. He determined to fall upon the British
detachment of Hessians, under Colonel Rahl, at Trenton, and there strike
his first blow. To each division of his little army a part in the
attack was assigned with careful forethought. Nothing was overlooked and
nothing omitted, and then, for some reason good or bad, every one of
the division commanders failed to do his part. As the general plan was
arranged, Gates was to march from Bristol with two thousand men; Ewing
was to cross at Trenton; Putnam was to come up from Philadelphia; and
Griffin was to make a diversion against Donop. When the moment came,
Gates, who disapproved the plan, was on his way to Congress; Griffin
abandoned New Jersey and fled before Donop; Putnam did not attempt
to leave Philadelphia; and Ewing made no effort to cross at Trenton.
Cadwalader came down from Bristol, looked at the river and the
floating ice, and then gave it up as desperate. Nothing remained except
Washington himself with the main army, but he neither gave up, nor
hesitated, nor stopped on account of the ice, or the river, or the
perils which lay beyond. On Christmas Eve, when all the Christian
world was feasting and rejoicing, and while the British were enjoying
themselves in their comfortable quarters, Washington set out. With
twenty-four hundred men he crossed the Delaware through the floating ice,
his boats managed and rowed by the sturdy fishermen of Marblehead from
Glover's regiment. The crossing was successful, and he landed about nine
miles from Trenton. It was bitter cold, and the sleet and snow drove
sharply in the faces of the troops. Sullivan, marching by the river,
sent word that the arms of his soldiers were wet. "Tell your general,"
was Washington's reply to the message, "to use the bayonet, for the
town must be taken." When they reached Trenton it was broad daylight.
Washington, at the front and on the right of the line, swept down the
Pennington road, and, as he drove back the Hessian pickets, he heard the
shout of Sullivan's men as, with Stark leading the van, they charged in
from the river. A company of jaegers and of light dragoons slipped away.
There was some fighting in the streets, but the attack was so strong and
well calculated that resistance was useless. Colonel Rahl, the British
commander, aroused from his revels, was killed as he rushed out to rally
his men, and in a few moments all was over. A thousand prisoners fell
into Washington's hands, and this important detachment of the enemy was
cut off and destroyed.

The news of Trenton alarmed the British, and Lord Cornwallis with seven
thousand of the best troops started at once from New York in hot pursuit
of the American army. Washington, who had now rallied some five thousand
men, fell back, skirmishing heavily, behind the Assunpink, and when
Cornwallis reached the river he found the American army awaiting him on
the other side of the stream. Night was falling, and Cornwallis, feeling
sure of his prey, decided that he would not risk an assault until the
next morning. Many lessons had not yet taught him that it was a fatal
business to give even twelve hours to the great soldier opposed to him.
During the night Washington, leaving his fires burning and taking
a roundabout road which he had already reconnoitered, marched to
Princeton. There he struck another British detachment. A sharp fight
ensued, the British division was broken and defeated, losing some five
hundred men, and Washington withdrew after this second victory to the
highlands of New Jersey to rest and recruit.

Frederick the Great is reported to have said that this was the most
brilliant campaign of the century. With a force very much smaller than
that of the enemy, Washington had succeeded in striking the British at
two places with superior forces at each point of contact. At Trenton he
had the benefit of a surprise, but the second time he was between two
hostile armies. He was ready to fight Cornwallis when the latter reached
the Assunpink, trusting to the strength of his position to make up for
his inferiority of numbers. But when Cornwallis gave him the delay of a
night, Washington, seeing the advantage offered by his enemy's mistake,
at once changed his whole plan, and, turning in his tracks, fell upon
the smaller of the two forces opposed to him, wrecking and defeating
it before the outgeneraled Cornwallis could get up with the main army.
Washington had thus shown the highest form of military skill, for
there is nothing that requires so much judgment and knowledge, so much
certainty of movement and quick decision, as to meet a superior enemy at
different points, force the fighting, and at each point to outnumber and
overwhelm him.

But the military part of this great campaign was not all. Many great
soldiers have not been statesmen, and have failed to realize the
political necessities of the situation. Washington presented the rare
combination of a great soldier and a great statesman as well. He aimed
not only to win battles, but by his operations in the field to influence
the political situation and affect public opinion. The American
Revolution was going to pieces. Unless some decisive victory could be
won immediately, it would have come to an end in the winter of 1776-77.
This Washington knew, and it was this which nerved his arm. The results
justified his forethought. The victories of Trenton and Princeton
restored the failing spirits of the people, and, what was hardly
less important, produced a deep impression in Europe in favor of the
colonies. The country, which had lost heart, and become supine and
almost hostile, revived. The militia again took the field. Outlying
parties of the British were attacked and cut off, and recruits once more
began to come in to the Continental army. The Revolution was saved. That
the English colonies in North America would have broken away from the
mother country sooner or later cannot be doubted, but that particular
Revolution Of 1776 would have failed within a year, had it not been
for Washington. It is not, however, merely the fact that he was a great
soldier and statesman which we should remember. The most memorable thing
to us, and to all men, is the heroic spirit of the man, which rose in
those dreary December days to its greatest height, under conditions
so adverse that they had crushed the hope of every one else. Let it
be remembered, also, that it was not a spirit of desperation or of
ignorance, a reckless daring which did not count the cost. No one knew
better than Washington--no one, indeed, so well--the exact state of
affairs; for he, conspicuously among great men, always looked facts
fearlessly in the face, and never deceived himself. He was under no
illusions, and it was this high quality of mind as much as any other
which enabled him to win victories.

How he really felt we know from what he wrote to Congress on December
20, when he said: "It may be thought that I am going a good deal out of
the line of my duty to adopt these measures or to advise thus freely.
A character to lose, an estate to forfeit, the inestimable blessing of
liberty at stake, and a life devoted, must be my excuse." These were the
thoughts in his mind when he was planning this masterly campaign. These
same thoughts, we may readily believe, were with him when his boat was
making its way through the ice of the Delaware on Christmas Eve. It was
a very solemn moment, and he was the only man in the darkness of that
night who fully understood what was at stake; but then, as always, he
was calm and serious, with a high courage which nothing could depress.

The familiar picture of a later day depicts Washington crossing the
Delaware at the head of his soldiers. He is standing up in the boat,
looking forward in the teeth of the storm. It matters little whether the
work of the painter is in exact accordance with the real scene or not.
The daring courage, the high resolve, the stern look forward and onward,
which the artist strove to show in the great leader, are all vitally
true. For we may be sure that the man who led that well-planned but
desperate assault, surrounded by darker conditions than the storms of
nature which gathered about his boat, and carrying with him the fortunes
of his country, was at that moment one of the most heroic figures in
history.




BENNINGTON

     We are but warriors for the working-day;
     Our gayness and our guilt are all besmirch'd
     With rainy marching in the painful field;
     There's not a piece of feather in our host
     (Good argument, I hope, we shall not fly),
     And time hath worn us into slovenry.
     But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim,
     And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night
     They'll be in fresher robes.
                          --Henry V.


The battle of Saratoga is included by Sir Edward Creasy among his
fifteen decisive battles which have, by their result, affected the
history of the world. It is true that the American Revolution was saved
by Washington in the remarkable Princeton and Trenton campaign, but
it is equally true that the surrender of Burgoyne at Saratoga, in the
following autumn, turned the scale decisively in favor of the colonists
by the impression which it made in Europe. It was the destruction of
Burgoyne's army which determined France to aid the Americans against
England. Hence came the French alliance, the French troops, and, what
was of far more importance, a French fleet by which Washington was
finally able to get control of the sea, and in this way cut off
Cornwallis at Yorktown and bring the Revolution to a successful close.
That which led, however, more directly than anything else to the final
surrender at Saratoga was the fight at Bennington, by which Burgoyne's
army was severely crippled and weakened, and by which also, the hardy
militia of the North eastern States were led to turn out in large
numbers and join the army of Gates.

The English ministry had built great hopes upon Burgoyne's expedition,
and neither expense nor effort had been spared to make it successful. He
was amply furnished with money and supplies as well as with English and
German troops, the latter of whom were bought from their wretched little
princes by the payment of generous subsidies. With an admirably equipped
army of over seven thousand men, and accompanied by a large force of
Indian allies, Burgoyne had started in May, 1777, from Canada. His plan
was to make his way by the lakes to the head waters of the Hudson, and
thence southward along the river to New York, where he was to unite with
Sir William Howe and the main army; in this way cutting the colonies in
two, and separating New England from the rest of the country.

At first all went well. The Americans were pushed back from their posts
on the lakes, and by the end of July Burgoyne was at the head waters of
the Hudson. He had already sent out a force, under St. Leger, to take
possession of the valley of the Mohawk--an expedition which finally
resulted in the defeat of the British by Herkimer, and the capture
of Fort Stanwix. To aid St. Leger by a diversion, and also to capture
certain magazines which were reported to be at Bennington, Burgoyne sent
another expedition to the eastward. This force consisted of about five
hundred and fifty white troops, chiefly Hessians, and one hundred and
fifty Indians, all under the command of Colonel Baum. They were within
four miles of Bennington on August 13, 1777, and encamped on a hill just
within the boundaries of the State of New York. The news of the advance
of Burgoyne had already roused the people of New York and New Hampshire,
and the legislature of the latter State had ordered General Stark with
a brigade of militia to stop the progress of the enemy on the western
frontier. Stark raised his standard at Charlestown on the Connecticut
River, and the militia poured into his camp. Disregarding Schuyler's
orders to join the main American army, which was falling back before
Burgoyne, Stark, as soon as he heard of the expedition against
Bennington, marched at once to meet Baum. He was within a mile of the
British camp on August 14, and vainly endeavored to draw Baum into
action. On the 15th it rained heavily, and the British forces occupied
the time in intrenching themselves strongly upon the hill which they
held. Baum meantime had already sent to Burgoyne for reinforcements,
and Burgoyne had detached Colonel Breymann with over six hundred regular
troops to go to Baum's assistance. On the 16th the weather cleared, and
Stark, who had been reinforced by militia from western Massachusetts,
determined to attack.

Early in the day he sent men, under Nichols and Herrick, to get into the
rear of Baum's position. The German officer, ignorant of the country
and of the nature of the warfare in which he was engaged, noticed small
bodies of men in their shirtsleeves, and carrying guns without bayonets,
making their way to the rear of his intrenchments. With singular
stupidity he concluded that they were Tory inhabitants of the country
who were coming to his assistance, and made no attempt to stop them. In
this way Stark was enabled to mass about five hundred men in the rear
of the enemy's position. Distracting the attention of the British by a
feint, Stark also moved about two hundred men to the right, and having
thus brought his forces into position he ordered a general assault,
and the Americans proceeded to storm the British intrenchments on every
side. The fight was a very hot one, and lasted some two hours. The
Indians, at the beginning of the action, slipped away between the
American detachments, but the British and German regulars stubbornly
stood their ground. It is difficult to get at the exact numbers of the
American troops, but Stark seems to have had between fifteen hundred and
two thousand militia. He thus outnumbered his enemy nearly three to
one, but his men were merely country militia, farmers of the New England
States, very imperfectly disciplined, and armed only with muskets and
fowling-pieces, without bayonets or side-arms. On the other side Baum
had the most highly disciplined troops of England and Germany under
his command, well armed and equipped, and he was moreover strongly
intrenched with artillery well placed behind the breastworks. The
advantage in the fight should have been clearly with Baum and his
regulars, who merely had to hold an intrenched hill.

It was not a battle in which either military strategy or a scientific
management of troops was displayed. All that Stark did was to place his
men so that they could attack the enemy's position on every side, and
then the Americans went at it, firing as they pressed on. The British
