    _If you let a man learn, and study, and work--and clamp
    a lid on so that nothing he takes into his mind can be
    let out--one way or another he'll blow a safety valve!_

Suddenly Collins snapped the pencil between his fingers and hurled the
pieces across the lab, where they clattered, rolled from the bench to
the floor, and were still. For a moment he sat leaning against the desk,
his hands trembling. He wasn't sure just when the last straw had been
added, but he was sure that he had had enough. The restrictions, red
tape, security measures of these government laboratories seemed to
close in on his mind in boiling, chaotic waves of frustration. What
was the good of his work, all this great installation, all the gleaming
expensive equipment in the lab around him? He was alone. None of them
seemed to share his problem, the unctuous, always correct Gordon, the
easy-mannered, unbearable Mason, all of them gave him a feeling of

Gardner's "Nucleonics and Nuclear Problems" lay open on the desk before
him, but he looked instead beyond through the clear curving glass windows

lower forests that gave Fair Oaks its name. Beside him unfinished lay the
summaries of the day's experiments, and the unorganized, hurriedly jotted
notes for tomorrow's work. The old intellectual alertness was gone.
Delight in changing theory, in careful experimentation no longer sprang
from his work and were a part of it. There was a dull, indefinable aching
in his head and a dry, dissatisfied sensation in his mouth.

Along the ordered walks below his laboratory windows workers and
technicians streamed toward the gates, checking out for the day through
the usual mass of red tape, passes, and Geiger tests. Lights were
flicking on in the long East Wing Dormitory across the quadrangle, and
the mess hall, where he had recently eaten a tasteless supper, was
lighted.

Shortly after restrictions had really begun to tighten up last fall,
he had written to a worker who had published making a minor correction
in his calculations and adding some suggestions arising from his own
research. A week later his letter was returned completely censored,
