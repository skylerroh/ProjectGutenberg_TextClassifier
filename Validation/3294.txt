    For all the pains you comforted:
    For all you pitied, all you bore,
    In sad and happy days of yore:--
    My second Mother, my first Wife,
    The angel of my infant life--
    From the sick child, now well and old,
    Take, nurse, the little book you hold!

    And grant it, Heaven, that all who read
    May find as dear a nurse at need,
    And every child who lists my rhyme,
    In the bright, fireside, nursery clime,
    May hear it in as kind a voice
    As made my childish days rejoice!

BED IN SUMMER


    In winter I get up at night
    And dress by yellow candle-light.
    In summer, quite the other way,
    I have to go to bed by day.

    I have to go to bed and see
    The birds still hopping on the tree,
    Or hear the grown-up people's feet
    Still going past me in the street.

    And does it not seem hard to you
    When all the sky is clear and blue,
    And I should like so much to play,
    To have to go to bed by day?

[Illustration: _"So fine a show was never seen."_]




YOUNG NIGHT THOUGHT


    All night long and every night,
    When my mama puts out the light
    I see the people marching by,
    As plain as day, before my eye.

    Armies and emperors and kings,
    All carrying different kinds of things,
    And marching in so grand a way,
    You never saw the like by day.

    So fine a show was never seen
    At the great circus on the green;
    For every kind of beast and man
    Is marching in that caravan.

    At first they move a little slow,
    But still the faster on they go,
    And still beside them close I keep
    Until we reach the Town of Sleep.

RAIN


    The rain is raining all around,
      It falls on field and tree,
    It rains on the umbrellas here,
      And on the ships at sea.




MY SHADOW


    I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,
    And what can be the use of him is more than I can see,
    He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
    And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.

    The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow--
    Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
    For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,
    And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.
