JACKANAPES

CHAPTER I.

    Last noon beheld them full of lusty life,
    Last eve in Beauty's circle proudly gay,
    The midnight brought the signal sound of strife,
    The morn the marshalling in arms--the day
    Battle's magnificently stern array!
    The thunder clouds close o'er it, which when rent
    The earth is covered thick with other clay,
    Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,
    Rider and horse:--friend, foe,--in one red burial blent.

    Their praise is hymn'd by loftier harps than mine:
    Yet one would I select from that proud throng.
    ---- to thee, to thousands, of whom each
    And one as all a ghastly gap did make
    In his own kind and kindred, whom to teach
    Forgetfulness were mercy for their sake;
    The Archangel's trump, not glory's, must awake
    Those whom they thirst for.--BYRON.


Two Donkeys and the Geese lived on the Green, and all other residents
of any social standing lived in houses round it. The houses had no
names. Everybody's address was, "The Green," but the Postman and the
people of the place knew where each family lived. As to the rest of
the world, what has one to do with the rest of the world, when he is
safe at home on his own Goose Green? Moreover, if a stranger did come
on any lawful business, he might ask his way at the shop.

Most of the inhabitants were long-lived, early deaths (like that of
the little Miss Jessamine) being exceptional; and most of the old
people were proud of their age, especially the sexton, who would be
ninety-nine come Martinmas, and whose father remembered a man who had
carried arrows, as a boy, for the battle of Flodden Field. The Grey
Goose and the big Miss Jessamine were the only elderly persons who
kept their ages secret. Indeed, Miss Jessamine never mentioned any
one's age, or recalled the exact year in which anything had happened.
She said that she had been taught that it was bad manners to do so "in
a mixed assembly."
