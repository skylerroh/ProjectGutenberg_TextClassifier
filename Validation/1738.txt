THE 184-INCH SYNCHROCYCLOTRON


His success with the 60-inch cyclotron in 1939 led Dr. E. O. Lawrence to
propose a much more powerful accelerator, one which could produce new
types of nuclear rearrangements and even create particles. Grants
totaling $1,225,000 permitted work to start on the 184-inch cyclotron in
August 1940.[1] It was designed to accelerate atomic particles to an
energy of 100 million electron volts (Mev), five times that possible
with the 60-inch machine.

Before the new cyclotron could be finished World War II began.
Construction on the cyclotron was therefore halted. However, because of
interest in separating the isotopes of uranium by the electromagnetic
method, work on the giant magnet continued at an even faster pace. This
magnet would contain 3700 tons of steel in its yoke and pole pieces, and
