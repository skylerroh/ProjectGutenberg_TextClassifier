    Fill thy sweet mouth, and figs of AEgilus:
    For ne'er cicala trilled so sweet a song.
    Here is the cup: mark, friend, how sweet it smells:
    The Hours, thou'lt say, have washed it in their well.
    Hither, Cissaetha! Thou, go milk her! Kids,
    Be steady, or your pranks will rouse the ram.




IDYLL II.


The Sorceress.

    Where are the bay-leaves, Thestylis, and the charms?
    Fetch all; with fiery wool the caldron crown;
    Let glamour win me back my false lord's heart!
    Twelve days the wretch hath not come nigh to me,
    Nor made enquiry if I die or live,
    Nor clamoured (oh unkindness!) at my door.
    Sure his swift fancy wanders otherwhere,
    The slave of Aphrodite and of Love.
    I'll off to Timagetus' wrestling-school
    At dawn, that I may see him and denounce
    His doings; but I'll charm him now with charms.
    So shine out fair, O moon! To thee I sing
    My soft low song: to thee and Hecate
    The dweller in the shades, at whose approach
    E'en the dogs quake, as on she moves through blood
    And darkness and the barrows of the slain.
    All hail, dread Hecate: companion me
    Unto the end, and work me witcheries
    Potent as Circe or Medea wrought,
    Or Perimede of the golden hair!
      _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.
    First we ignite the grain. Nay, pile it on:
    Where are thy wits flown, timorous Thestylis?
    Shall I be flouted, I, by such as thou?
    Pile, and still say, 'This pile is of his bones.'
      _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.
    Delphis racks me: I burn him in these bays.
    As, flame-enkindled, they lift up their voice,
    Blaze once, and not a trace is left behind:
    So waste his flesh to powder in yon fire!
      _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.
    E'en as I melt, not uninspired, the wax,
    May Mindian Delphis melt this hour with love:
    And, swiftly as this brazen wheel whirls round,
    May Aphrodite whirl him to my door.
      _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.
    Next burn the husks. Hell's adamantine floor
    And aught that else stands firm can Artemis move.
    Thestylis, the hounds bay up and down the town:
    The goddess stands i' the crossroads: sound the gongs.
      _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.
    Hushed are the voices of the winds and seas;
    But O not hushed the voice of my despair.
    He burns my being up, who left me here
    No wife, no maiden, in my misery.
      _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.
    Thrice I pour out; speak thrice, sweet mistress, thus:
    "What face soe'er hangs o'er him be forgot
    Clean as, in Dia, Theseus (legends say)
    Forgat his Ariadne's locks of love."
      _Turn, magic, wheel, draw homeward him I love_.
    The coltsfoot grows in Arcady, the weed
    That drives the mountain-colts and swift mares wild.
    Like them may Delphis rave: so, maniac-wise,
    Race from his burnished brethren home to me.
      _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.
    He lost this tassel from his robe; which I
    Shred thus, and cast it on the raging flames.
    Ah baleful Love! why, like the marsh-born leech,
    Cling to my flesh, and drain my dark veins dry?
      _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.
    From a crushed eft tomorrow he shall drink
    Death! But now, Thestylis, take these herbs and smear
    That threshold o'er, whereto at heart I cling
    Still, still--albeit he thinks scorn of me--
    And spit, and say, ''Tis Delphis' bones I smear.'
      _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.

                                            [_Exit Thestylis_.

    Now, all alone, I'll weep a love whence sprung
    When born? Who wrought my sorrow? Anaxo came,
    Her basket in her hand, to Artemis' grove.
    Bound for the festival, troops of forest beasts
    Stood round, and in the midst a lioness.
      _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.
    Theucharidas' slave, my Thracian nurse now dead
    Then my near neighbour, prayed me and implored
    To see the pageant: I, the poor doomed thing,
    Went with her, trailing a fine silken train,
    And gathering round me Clearista's robe.
      _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.
    Now, the mid-highway reached by Lycon's farm,
    Delphis and Eudamippus passed me by.
    With beards as lustrous as the woodbine's gold
    And breasts more sheeny than thyself, O Moon,
    Fresh from the wrestler's glorious toil they came.
      _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.
    I saw, I raved, smit (weakling) to my heart.
    My beauty withered, and I cared no more
    For all that pomp; and how I gained my home
    I know not: some strange fever wasted me.
    Ten nights and days I lay upon my bed.
      _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.
    And wan became my flesh, as 't had been dyed,
    And all my hair streamed off, and there was left
    But bones and skin. Whose threshold crossed I not,
    Or missed what grandam's hut who dealt in charms?
    For no light thing was this, and time sped on.
      _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.
    At last I spake the truth to that my maid:
    "Seek, an thou canst, some cure for my sore pain.
    Alas, I am all the Mindian's! But begone,
    And watch by Timagetus' wrestling-school:
    There doth he haunt, there soothly take his rest.
      _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.
    "Find him alone: nod softly: say, 'she waits';
    And bring him." So I spake: she went her way,
    And brought the lustrous-limbed one to my roof.
    And I, the instant I beheld him step
    Lightfooted o'er the threshold of my door,
      _(Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_,)
    Became all cold like snow, and from my brow
    Brake the damp dewdrops: utterance I had none,
    Not e'en such utterance as a babe may make
    That babbles to its mother in its dreams;
    But all my fair frame stiffened into wax.
      _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.
    He bent his pitiless eyes on me; looked down,
    And sate him on my couch, and sitting, said:
    "Thou hast gained on me, Simaetha, (e'en as I
    Gained once on young Philinus in the race,)
    Bidding me hither ere I came unasked.
      _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.
    "For I had come, by Eros I had come,
    This night, with comrades twain or may-be more,
    The fruitage of the Wine-god in my robe,
    And, wound about my brow with ribands red,
    The silver leaves so dear to Heracles.
      _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.
    "Had ye said 'Enter,' well: for 'mid my peers
    High is my name for goodliness and speed:
    I had kissed that sweet mouth once and gone my way.
    But had the door been barred, and I thrust out,
    With brand and axe would we have stormed ye then.
      _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.
    "Now be my thanks recorded, first to Love,
    Next to thee, maiden, who didst pluck me out,
    A half-burned helpless creature, from the flames,
    And badst me hither. It is Love that lights
    A fire more fierce than his of Lipara;
      _(Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.)
    "Scares, mischief-mad, the maiden from her bower,
    The bride from her warm couch." He spake: and I,
    A willing listener, sat, my hand in his,
    Among the cushions, and his cheek touched mine,
    Each hotter than its wont, and we discoursed
    In soft low language. Need I prate to thee,
    Sweet Moon, of all we said and all we did?
    Till yesterday he found no fault with me,
    Nor I with him. But lo, to-day there came
    Philista's mother--hers who flutes to me--
    With her Melampo's; just when up the sky
    Gallop the mares that chariot rose-limbed Dawn:
    And divers tales she brought me, with the rest
    How Delphis loved, she knew not rightly whom:
    But this she knew; that of the rich wine, aye
    He poured 'to Love;' and at the last had fled,
    To line, she deemed, the fair one's hall with flowers.
    Such was my visitor's tale, and it was true:
    For thrice, nay four times, daily he would stroll
    Hither, leave here full oft his Dorian flask:
    Now--'tis a fortnight since I saw his face.
    Doth he then treasure something sweet elsewhere?
    Am I forgot? I'll charm him now with charms.
    But let him try me more, and by the Fates
    He'll soon be knocking at the gates of hell.
    Spells of such power are in this chest of mine,
    Learned, lady, from mine host in Palestine.

      Lady, farewell: turn ocean-ward thy steeds:
    As I have purposed, so shall I fulfil.
    Farewell, thou bright-faced Moon! Ye stars, farewell,
    That wait upon the car of noiseless Night.




IDYLL III.


The Serenade.

    I pipe to Amaryllis; while my goats,
    Tityrus their guardian, browse along the fell.
    O Tityrus, as I love thee, feed my goats:
    And lead them to the spring, and, Tityrus, 'ware
    The lifted crest of yon gray Libyan ram.
      Ah winsome Amaryllis! Why no more
    Greet'st thou thy darling, from the caverned rock
    Peeping all coyly? Think'st thou scorn of him?
    Hath a near view revealed him satyr-shaped
    Of chin and nostril? I shall hang me soon.
    See here ten apples: from thy favourite tree
    I plucked them: I shall bring ten more anon.
    Ah witness my heart-anguish! Oh were I
    A booming bee, to waft me to thy lair,
    Threading the fern and ivy in whose depths
    Thou nestlest! I have learned what Love is now:
    Fell god, he drank the lioness's milk,
    In the wild woods his mother cradled him,
    Whose fire slow-burns me, smiting to the bone.
    O thou whose glance is beauty and whose heart
    All marble: O dark-eyebrowed maiden mine!
    Cling to thy goatherd, let him kiss thy lips,
    For there is sweetness in an empty kiss.
    Thou wilt not? Piecemeal I will rend the crown,
    The ivy-crown which, dear, I guard for thee,
    Inwov'n with scented parsley and with flowers:
    Oh I am desperate--what betides me, what?--
    Still art thou deaf? I'll doff my coat of skins
    And leap into yon waves, where on the watch
    For mackerel Olpis sits: tho' I 'scape death,
    That I have all but died will pleasure thee.
    That learned I when (I murmuring 'loves she me?')
    The _Love-in-absence_, crushed, returned no sound,
    But shrank and shrivelled on my smooth young wrist.
    I learned it of the sieve-divining crone
    Who gleaned behind the reapers yesterday:
    'Thou'rt wrapt up all,' Agraia said, 'in her;
    She makes of none account her worshipper.'
      Lo! a white goat, and twins, I keep for thee:
    Mermnon's lass covets them: dark she is of skin:
    But yet hers be they; thou but foolest me.
      She cometh, by the quivering of mine eye.
    I'll lean against the pine-tree here and sing.
    She may look round: she is not adamant.

    [_Sings_] Hippomenes, when he a maid would wed,
    Took apples in his hand and on he sped.
    Famed Atalanta's heart was won by this;
    She marked, and maddening sank in Love's abyss.

      From Othrys did the seer Melampus stray
    To Pylos with his herd: and lo there lay
    In a swain's arms a maid of beauty rare;
    Alphesiboea, wise of heart, she bare.

      Did not Adonis rouse to such excess
    Of frenzy her whose name is Loveliness,
    (He a mere lad whose wethers grazed the hill)
    That, dead, he's pillowed on her bosom still?

      Endymion sleeps the sleep that changeth not:
    And, maiden mine, I envy him his lot!
    Envy Iasion's: his it was to gain
    Bliss that I dare not breathe in ears profane.

      My head aches. What reck'st thou? I sing no more:
    E'en where I fell I'll lie, until the wolves
    Rend me--may that be honey in thy mouth!




IDYLL IV.


The Herdsmen.

_BATTUS. CORYDON._

    BATTUS.
    Who owns these cattle, Corydon? Philondas? Prythee say.

    CORYDON.
    No, AEgon: and he gave them me to tend while he's away.

    BATTUS.
    Dost milk them in the gloaming, when none is nigh to see?

    CORYDON.
    The old man brings the calves to suck, and keeps an eye on me.

    BATTUS.
    And to what region then hath flown the cattle's rightful lord?

    CORYDON.
    Hast thou not heard? With Milo he vanished Elis-ward.

    BATTUS.
    How! was the wrestler's oil e'er yet so much as seen by him?

    CORYDON.
    Men say he rivals Heracles in lustiness of limb.

    BATTUS.
    I'm Polydeuces' match (or so my mother says) and more.

    CORYDON.
    --So off he started; with a spade, and of these ewes a score.

    BATTUS.
    This Milo will be teaching wolves how they should raven next.

    CORYDON.
    --And by these bellowings his kine proclaim how sore they're vexed.

    BATTUS.
    Poor kine! they've found their master a sorry knave indeed.

    CORYDON.
    They're poor enough, I grant you: they have not heart to feed.

    BATTUS.
    Look at that heifer! sure there's naught, save bare bones, left of her.
    Pray, does she browse on dewdrops, as doth the grasshopper?

    CORYDON.
    Not she, by heaven! She pastures now by AEsarus' glades,
    And handfuls fair I pluck her there of young and green grass-blades;
    Now bounds about Latymnus, that gathering-place of shades.

    BATTUS.
    That bull again, the red one, my word but he is lean!
    I wish the Sybarite burghers aye may offer to the queen
    Of heaven as pitiful a beast: those burghers are so mean!

    CORYDON.
    Yet to the Salt Lake's edges I drive him, I can swear;
    Up Physcus, up Neaethus' side--he lacks not victual there,
    With dittany and endive and foxglove for his fare.

    BATTUS.
    Well, well! I pity AEgon. His cattle, go they must
    To rack and ruin, all because vain-glory was his lust.
    The pipe that erst he fashioned is doubtless scored with rust?

    CORYDON.
    Nay, by the Nymphs! That pipe he left to me, the self-same day
    He made for Pisa: I am too a minstrel in my way:
    Well the flute-part in '_Pyrrhus_' and in '_Glauca_' can I play.
    I sing too '_Here's to Croton_' and '_Zacynthus O 'tis fair_,'
    And '_Eastward to Lacinium_:'--the bruiser Milo there
    His single self ate eighty loaves; there also did he pull
    Down from its mountain-dwelling, by one hoof grasped, a bull,
    And gave it Amaryllis: the maidens screamed with fright;
    As for the owner of the bull he only laughed outright.

    BATTUS.
    Sweet Amaryllis! thou alone, though dead, art unforgot.
    Dearer than thou, whose light is quenched, my very goats are not.
    Oh for the all-unkindly fate that's fallen to my lot!

    CORYDON.
    Cheer up, brave lad! tomorrow may ease thee of thy pain:
    Aye for the living are there hopes, past' hoping are the slain:
    And now Zeus sends us sunshine, and now he sends us rain.

    BATTUS.
    I'm better. Beat those young ones off! E'en now their teeth attack
    That olive's shoots, the graceless brutes! Back, with your white face,
        back!

    CORYDON.
    Back to thy hill, Cymaetha! Great Pan, how deaf thou art!
    I shall be with thee presently, and in the end thou'lt smart.
    I warn thee, keep thy distance. Look, up she creeps again!
    Oh were my hare-crook in nay hand, I'd give it to her then!

    BATTUS.
    For heaven's sake, Corydon, look here! Just now a bramble-spike
    Ran, there, into my instep--and oh how deep they strike,
    Those lancewood-shafts! A murrain light on that calf, I say!
    I got it gaping after her. Canst thou discern it, pray?

    CORYDON.
    Ay, ay; and here I have it, safe in my finger-nails.

    BATTUS.
    Eh! at how slight a matter how tall a warrior quails!

    CORYDON.
    Ne'er range the hill-crest, Battus, all sandal-less and bare:
    Because the thistle and the thorn lift aye their plumed heads there.

    BATTUS.
    --Say, Corydon, does that old man we wot of (tell me please!)
    Still haunt the dark-browed little girl whom once he used to tease?

    CORYDON.
    Ay my poor boy, that doth he: I saw them yesterday
    Down by the byre; and, trust me, loving enough were they.

    BATTUS.
    Well done, my veteran light-o'-love! In deeming thee mere man,
    I wronged thy sire: some Satyr he, or an uncouth-limbed Pan.




IDYLL V.


The Battle of the Bards.


_COMETAS. LACON. MORSON_.


    COMETAS.
    Goats, from a shepherd who stands here, from Lacon, keep away:
    Sibyrtas owns him; and he stole my goatskin yesterday.

    LACON.
    Hi! lambs! avoid yon fountain. Have ye not eyes to see
    Cometas, him who filched a pipe but two days back from me?

    COMETAS.
    Sibyrtas' bondsman own a pipe? whence gotst thou that, and how?
    Tootling through straws with Corydon mayhap's beneath thee now?

    LACON.
    'Twas Lycon's gift, your highness. But pray, Cometas, say,
    What is that skin wherewith thou saidst that Lacon walked away?
    Why, thy lord's self had ne'er a skin whereon his limbs to lay.

    COMETAS.
    The skin that Crocylus gave me, a dark one streaked with white,
    The day he slew his she-goat. Why, thou wert ill with spite,
    Then, my false friend; and thou would'st end by beggaring me quite.

    LACON.
    Did Lacon, did Calaethis' son purloin a goatskin? No,
    By Pan that haunts the sea-beach! Lad, if I served thee so,
    Crazed may I drop from yon hill-top to Crathis' stream below!

    COMETAS.
    Nor pipe of thine, good fellow--the Ladies of the Lake
    So be still kind and good to me--did e'er Cometas take.

    LACON.
    Be Daphnis' woes my portion, should that my credence win!
    Still, if thou list to stake a kid--that surely were no sin--
    Come on, I'll sing it out with thee--until thou givest in.

    COMETAS.
    '_The hog he braved Athene._' As for the kid, 'tis there:
    You stake a lamb against him--that fat one--if you dare.

    LACON.
    Fox! were that fair for either? At shearing who'd prefer
    Horsehair to wool? or when the goat stood handy, suffer her
    To nurse her firstling, and himself go milk a blatant cur?

    COMETAS.
    The same who deemed his hornet's-buzz the true cicala's note,
    And braved--like you--his better. And so forsooth you vote
    My kid a trifle? Then come on, fellow! I stake the goat.

    LACON.
    Why be so hot? Art thou on fire? First prythee take thy seat
    'Neath this wild woodland olive: thy tones will sound more sweet.
    Here falls a cold rill drop by drop, and green grass-blades uprear
    Their heads, and fallen leaves are thick, and locusts prattle here.

    COMETAS.
    Hot I am not; but hurt I am, and sorely, when I think
    That thou canst look me in the face and never bleach nor blink--
    Me, thine own boyhood's tutor! Go, train the she-wolf's brood:
    Train dogs--that they may rend thee! This, this is gratitude!

    LACON.
    When learned I from thy practice or thy preaching aught that's right,
    Thou puppet, thou misshapen lump of ugliness and spite?

    COMETAS.
    When? When I beat thee, wailing sore: yon goats looked on with glee,
    And bleated; and were dealt with e'en as I had dealt with thee.

    LACON.
    Well, hunchback, shallow be thy grave as was thy judgment then!
    But hither, hither! Thou'lt not dip in herdsman's lore again.

    COMETAS.
    Nay, here are oaks and galingale: the hum of housing bees
    Makes the place pleasant, and the birds are piping in the trees.
    And here are two cold streamlets; here deeper shadows fall
    Than yon place owns, and look what cones drop from the pinetree tall.

    LACON.
    Come hither, and tread on lambswool that is soft as any dream:
    Still more unsavoury than thyself to me thy goatskins seem.
    Here will I plant a bowl of milk, our ladies' grace to win;
    And one, as huge, beside it, sweet olive-oil therein.

    COMETAS.
