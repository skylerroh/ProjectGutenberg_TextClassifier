America presented itself as a virgin land to the original settlers from
Europe. It had no history, no memories, no civilization that appealed to
European traditions or associations. Its inhabitants belonged evidently
to the human brotherhood, and their appearance and language, as well as
some of their customs, indicated Mongolian kinship and Asiatic origin,
but in the eyes of their conquerors they were as strange as if they had
sprung from another planet, and the invaders were equally strange and
marvelous to the natives. To the Spanish adventurer the wondrous temples
of the Aztecs and the Peruvians bore no significance, except as they
indicated wealth to be won, and rich empires waiting to be prey to the
superior prowess and arms of the Christian aggressor; while the
Englishman, the Frenchman, Hollander and Swede, who planted their colors
on more northern soil, saw only a region of primeval forests inhabited by
tribes almost as savage as the wild beasts upon whom they existed. It is
needless, therefore, in this pen picture of our country, to go into any
extended notice of its ancient inhabitants, although the writer has
devoted not a little independent study to their origin and history. That
study has confirmed him in the opinion that the American Indians came
from Asia, with such slight admixture as the winds and waves may have
brought from Europe, Africa and Polynesia. The resemblance of the
American Indians to the Tartar tribes in language is striking, and in
physical appearance still more so, while the difference in manners and
customs is no greater than that between the Englishman of the seventeenth
century and his descendant in the mountains of West Virginia or Kentucky.
It is probable--indeed what is known of the aborigines indicates, that
the immigrations were successive, and their succession would be fully
accounted for by the mighty convulsions among Asiatic nations, of which
history gives us a very dim idea. It is easy to suppose that more than
one dusky AEneas led his fugitive followers across the narrow strait which
divides Asia from America, and pushed on to the warmer regions of the
South, driving in turn before him less vigorous and warlike tribes,
seizing the lands which they had made fruitful, and adopting in part the
civilization which they had built up. Many of the conquered would prefer
emigration to submission, and in their turn push farther south, even to
the uttermost bound of the continent.

The writer is not of those who believe that the remote inhabitants of
America are unrepresented among the red men of the present age. In
European and American history the myths about exterminated races are
disappearing in the light of investigation. Our ancestors were not so
cruel as they have been painted. It is not likely that any nation was
ever cut off to a man. Men were too valuable to be destroyed beyond the
requirements of warfare or the demands of sanguinary religious customs.
Conquered nations, it is now agreed, were usually absorbed by their
conquerors, either as equals or serfs. In either event unity was the
result, as in the case of the Romans and Latins, the Scots and the Picts,
the Normans and the Saxons. The mound builders, in all probability,
survive in the Indian tribes of to-day, some of whom in the Southwest
were mound builders within the historic period, while the ruined cities
of Arizona and New Mexico were the product of a rude civilization,
admittedly inherited by the pueblos of the present generation.

There was nothing in the civilization of the most advanced American races
worth preserving, except their monuments. The destruction of the Aztec
and Peruvian empires was, on the whole, an advantage to humanity. The
darkest period of religious persecution in Europe saw nothing to compare
with the sanguinary rites of Aztec worship, and bigoted, intolerant and
oppressive as the Spaniards were they did a service to mankind in putting
an end to those barbarities. The colonial system established by Spain in
America was founded on the principle that dominion over the American
provinces was vested in the crown, not in the kingdom. The Spanish
possessions on this continent were regarded as the personal property of
the sovereign.

The viceroys were appointed by the king and removable by him at pleasure.
All grants of lands were made by the sovereign, and if they failed from
any cause they reverted to the crown. All political and civil power
centred in the king, and was executed by such persons and in such manner
as the will of the sovereign might suggest, wholly independent not only
of the colonies but of the Spanish nation. The only civil privileges
allowed to the colonists were strictly municipal, and confined to the
regulation of their interior police and commerce in cities and towns, for
which purpose they made their own local regulations or laws, and
appointed town and city magistrates. The Spanish-American governments
were not merely despotic like those of Russia and Turkey, but they were a
more dangerous kind of despotism, as the absolute power of the sovereign
was not exercised by himself, but by deputy.

At first the dominions of Spain in the new world were divided, for
purposes of administration, into two great divisions or vice-royalties:
New Spain and Peru. Afterward, as the country became more settled, the
vice-royalty of Santa Fe de Bogota was created. A deputy or vice-king was
appointed to preside over each of these governments, who was the
