_PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH PROTESTANT EDITION._


Some apology is perhaps needed when a Protestant thus brings before
Protestant readers the works of a consistent Roman Catholic author. The
plea must be, that the doctrine and experience described are essentially
Protestant; and so far from their receiving the assent of the Roman
Catholic Church, their author was persecuted for holding and
disseminating them.

Of the experience of Madame Guyon, it should be borne in mind, that
though the glorious heights of communion with God to which she attained
may be scaled by the feeblest of God's chosen ones, yet it is by no
means necessary that they should be reached by the same apparently
arduous and protracted path along which she was led.

The "Torrents" especially needs to be regarded rather as an account of
the personal experience of the author, than as the plan which God
invariably, or even usually, adopts in bringing the soul into a state of
union with Himself. It is true that, in order that we may "live unto
righteousness," we must be "dead indeed unto sin;" and that there must
be a crucifixion of self before the life of Christ can be made manifest
in us. It is only when we can say, "I am crucified with Christ," that we
are able to add, "Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in
me." But it does not follow that this inward death must always be as
lingering as in the case of Madame Guyon. She tells us herself that the
reason was, that she was not wholly resigned to the Divine will, and
willing to be deprived of the gifts of God, that she might enjoy the
possession of the Giver. This resistance to the will of God implies
suffering on the part of the creature, and chastisement on the part of
God, in order that He may subdue to Himself what is not voluntarily
yielded to Him.

Of the joy of a complete surrender to God, it is not necessary to speak
here: thousands of God's children are realising its blessedness for
themselves, and proving that it is no hardship, but a joy unspeakable,
to present themselves a living sacrifice to God, to live no longer to
themselves, but to Him that died for them, and rose again.

A simple trust in a living, personal Saviour; a putting away by His
grace of all that is known to be in opposition to His will; and an
entire self-abandonment to Him, that His designs may be worked out in
and through us; such is the simple key to the hidden sanctuary of
communion.

CHAPTER I.

SOULS UNDER DIVINE INFLUENCE ARE IMPELLED TO SEEK AFTER GOD, BUT IN
DIFFERENT WAYS--REDUCED TO THREE, AND EXPLAINED BY A SIMILITUDE.


As soon as a soul is brought under divine influence, and its return to
God is true and sincere, after the first cleansing which confession and
contrition have effected, God imparts to it a certain instinct to return
to Him in a most complete manner, and to become united to Him. The soul
feels then that it was not created for the amusements and trifles of the
world, but that it has a centre and an end, to which it must be its aim
to return, and out of which it can never find true repose. This
instinct is very deeply implanted in the soul, more or less in different
cases, according to the designs of God; but all have a loving impatience
to purify themselves, and to adopt the necessary ways and means of
returning to their source and origin, like rivers, which, after leaving
their source, flow on continuously, in order to precipitate themselves
into the sea. You will observe that some rivers move gravely and slowly,
and others with greater velocity; but there are rivers and _torrents_
which rush with frightful impetuosity, and which nothing can arrest. All
the burdens which might be laid upon them, and the obstructions which
might be placed to impede their course, would only serve to redouble
their violence. It is thus with souls. Some go on quietly towards
perfection, and never reach the sea, or only very late, contented to
lose themselves in some stronger and more rapid river, which carries
them with itself into the sea. Others, which form the second class, flow
on more vigorously and promptly than the first. They even carry with
them a number of rivulets; but they are slow and idle in comparison
with the last class, which rush onward with so much impetuosity, that
they are utterly useless: they are not available for navigation, nor can
any merchandise be trusted upon them, except at certain parts and at
certain times. These are bold and mad rivers, which dash against the
rocks, which terrify by their noise, and which stop at nothing. The
second class are more agreeable and more useful; their gravity is
pleasing, they are all laden with merchandise, and we sail upon them
without fear or peril.

Let us look, with divine aid, at these three classes of persons, under
the three figures that I have proposed; and we will commence with the
first, in order to conclude happily with the last.




CHAPTER II.

OF THE FIRST WAY, WHICH IS ACTIVE, AND OF MEDITATION--WHAT IT IS--ITS
WEAKNESSES, HABITS, OCCUPATIONS, ADVANTAGES, ETC.--GENERAL OPINION--WANT
OF OBSERVATION THE CAUSE OF MOST OF THE DISPUTES AND DIFFICULTIES WHICH
HAVE ARISEN UPON THE PASSIVE WAY, AND THE ABSURD OBJECTIONS WHICH HAVE
BEEN MADE TO IT--SOULS FOR MEDITATION--THEY SHOULD BE LED TO IT THROUGH
THE AFFECTIONS--OPINION CONCERNING THEIR BARRENNESS AND
POWERLESSNESS--SPIRITUAL BOOKS AND AUTHORS ON THE INNER LIFE, IN
CONTRAST TO OTHERS--CAPACITY AND INCAPACITY OF SOULS--THE SIMPLE ARE
BETTER THAN THE GREAT REASONERS.


The first class of souls are those who, after their conversion, give
themselves up to meditation, or even to works of charity. They perform
some exterior austerities; endeavour, little by little, to purify
themselves, to rid themselves of certain notable sins, and even of
voluntary venial ones. They endeavour, with all their little strength,
to advance gradually, but it is feebly and slowly.

As their source is not abundant, the dryness sometimes causes delay.
There are even periods, in times of aridity, when they dry up
altogether. They do not cease to flow from the source, but it is so
feebly as to be barely perceptible. These rivers carry little or no
merchandise, and, therefore, for the public need, it must be taken to
them. It is necessary, at the same time, that art should assist nature,
and find the means of enlarging them, either by canals, or by the help
of other rivers of the same kind, which are joined together and united
to it, which rivers thus joined increase the body of water, and, helping
each other, put themselves in a condition to carry a few small boats,
not to the sea, but to some of the chief rivers, of which we shall speak
later. Such beings have usually little depth of spiritual life. They
work outwardly, and rarely quit their meditations, so that they are not
fit for great things. In general they carry no merchandise--that is to
say, they can impart nothing to others; and God seldom uses them, unless
it be to carry a few little boats--that is, to minister to bodily
necessities; and in order to be used, they must be discharged into the
canals of sensible graces, or united to some others in religion, by
which means several, of medium grace, manage to carry the small boat,
