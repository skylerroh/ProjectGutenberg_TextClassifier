    Although my speech Antinoues may, perchance,
    Provoke thee, know that I am not averse
    From kingly cares, if Jove appoint me such.
    Seems it to thee a burthen to be fear'd
    By men above all others? trust me, no,
    There is no ill in royalty; the man
    So station'd, waits not long ere he obtain
    Riches and honour. But I grant that Kings
    Of the Achaians may no few be found
    In sea-girt Ithaca both young and old,                           500
    Of whom since great Ulysses is no more,
    Reign whoso may; but King, myself, I am
    In my own house, and over all my own
    Domestics, by Ulysses gained for me.
      To whom Eurymachus replied, the son
    Of Polybus. What Grecian Chief shall reign
    In sea-girt Ithaca, must be referr'd
    To the Gods' will, Telemachus! meantime
    Thou hast unquestionable right to keep
    Thy own, and to command in thy own house.                        510
    May never that man on her shores arrive,
    While an inhabitant shall yet be left
    In Ithaca, who shall by violence wrest
    Thine from thee. But permit me, noble Sir!
    To ask thee of thy guest. Whence came the man?
    What country claims him? Where are to be found
    His kindred and his patrimonial fields?
    Brings he glad tidings of thy Sire's approach
    Homeward? or came he to receive a debt
    Due to himself? How swift he disappear'd!                        520
    Nor opportunity to know him gave
    To those who wish'd it; for his face and air
    Him speak not of Plebeian birth obscure.
      Whom answered thus Telemachus discrete.
    Eurymachus! my father comes no more.
    I can no longer now tidings believe,
    If such arrive; nor he'd I more the song
    Of sooth-sayers whom my mother may consult.
    But this my guest hath known in other days
    My father, and he came from Taphos, son                          530
    Of brave Anchialus, Mentes by name,
    And Chief of the sea-practis'd Taphian race.
      So spake Telemachus, but in his heart
    Knew well his guest a Goddess from the skies.
    Then they to dance and heart-enlivening song
    Turn'd joyous, waiting the approach of eve,
    And dusky evening found them joyous still.
    Then each, to his own house retiring, sought
    Needful repose. Meantime Telemachus
    To his own lofty chamber, built in view                          540
    Of the wide hall, retired; but with a heart
    In various musings occupied intense.
    Sage Euryclea, bearing in each hand
    A torch, preceded him; her sire was Ops,
    Pisenor's son, and, in her early prime,
    At his own cost Laertes made her his,
    Paying with twenty beeves her purchase-price,
    Nor in less honour than his spotless wife
    He held her ever, but his consort's wrath
    Fearing, at no time call'd her to his bed.                       550
    She bore the torches, and with truer heart
    Loved him than any of the female train,
    For she had nurs'd him in his infant years.
    He open'd his broad chamber-valves, and sat
    On his couch-side: then putting off his vest
    Of softest texture, placed it in the hands
    Of the attendant dame discrete, who first
    Folding it with exactest care, beside
    His bed suspended it, and, going forth,
    Drew by its silver ring the portal close,                        560
    And fasten'd it with bolt and brace secure.
    There lay Telemachus, on finest wool
    Reposed, contemplating all night his course
    Prescribed by Pallas to the Pylian shore.

BOOK II

ARGUMENT

Telemachus having convened an assembly of the Greecians, publicly calls
on the Suitors to relinquish the house of Ulysses. During the continuance
of the Council he has much to suffer from the petulance of the Suitors,
from whom, having informed them of his design to undertake a voyage in
hope to obtain news of Ulysses, he asks a ship, with all things necessary
for the purpose. He is refused, but is afterwards furnished with what he
wants by Minerva, in the form of Mentor. He embarks in the evening
without the privity of his mother, and the Goddess sails with him.


    Aurora, rosy daughter of the dawn,
    Now ting'd the East, when habited again,
    Uprose Ulysses' offspring from his bed.
    Athwart his back his faulchion keen he flung,
    His sandals bound to his unsullied feet,
    And, godlike, issued from his chamber-door.
    At once the clear-voic'd heralds he enjoin'd
    To call the Greeks to council; they aloud
    Gave forth the summons, and the throng began.
    When all were gather'd, and the assembly full,                    10
    Himself, his hand arm'd with a brazen spear,
    Went also; nor alone he went; his hounds
    Fleet-footed follow'd him, a faithful pair.
    O'er all his form Minerva largely shed
    Majestic grace divine, and, as he went,
    The whole admiring concourse gaz'd on him,
    The seniors gave him place, and down he sat
    On his paternal Throne. Then grave arose
    The Hero, old AEgyptius; bow'd with age
    Was he, and by experience deep-inform'd.                          20
    His son had with Ulysses, godlike Chief,
    On board his fleet to steed-fam'd Ilium gone,
    The warrior Antiphus, whom in his cave
    The savage Cyclops slew, and on his flesh
    At ev'ning made obscene his last regale.
    Three sons he had beside, a suitor one,
    Eurynomus; the other two, employ
    Found constant managing their Sire's concerns.
    Yet he forgat not, father as he was
    Of these, his absent eldest, whom he mourn'd                      30
    Ceaseless, and thus his speech, weeping, began.
      Hear me, ye men of Ithaca, my friends!
    Nor council here nor session hath been held
    Since great Ulysses left his native shore.
    Who now convenes us? what especial need
    Hath urged him, whether of our youth he be,
    Or of our senators by age matured?
    Have tidings reach'd him of our host's return,
    Which here he would divulge? or brings he aught
    Of public import on a diff'rent theme?                            40
    I deem him, whosoe'er he be, a man
    Worthy to prosper, and may Jove vouchsafe
    The full performance of his chief desire!
      He ended, and Telemachus rejoiced
    In that good omen. Ardent to begin,
    He sat not long, but, moving to the midst,
    Received the sceptre from Pisenor's hand,
    His prudent herald, and addressing, next,
    The hoary Chief AEgyptius, thus began.
      Not far remote, as thou shalt soon thyself                      50
    Perceive, oh venerable Chief! he stands,
    Who hath convened this council. I, am He.
    I am in chief the suff'rer. Tidings none
    Of the returning host I have received,
    Which here I would divulge, nor bring I aught
    Of public import on a different theme,
    But my own trouble, on my own house fall'n,
    And two-fold fall'n. One is, that I have lost
    A noble father, who, as fathers rule
    Benign their children, govern'd once yourselves;                  60
    The other, and the more alarming ill,
    With ruin threatens my whole house, and all
    My patrimony with immediate waste.
    Suitors, (their children who in this our isle
    Hold highest rank) importunate besiege
    My mother, though desirous not to wed,
    And rather than resort to her own Sire
    Icarius, who might give his daughter dow'r,
    And portion her to whom he most approves,
    (A course which, only named, moves their disgust)                 70
    They chuse, assembling all within my gates
    Daily to make my beeves, my sheep, my goats
    Their banquet, and to drink without restraint
    My wine; whence ruin threatens us and ours;
    For I have no Ulysses to relieve
    Me and my family from this abuse.
    Ourselves are not sufficient; we, alas!
    Too feeble should be found, and yet to learn
    How best to use the little force we own;
    Else, had I pow'r, I would, myself, redress                       80
    The evil; for it now surpasses far
    All suff'rance, now they ravage uncontroul'd,
    Nor show of decency vouchsafe me more.
    Oh be ashamed[6] yourselves; blush at the thought
    Of such reproach as ye shall sure incur
    From all our neighbour states, and fear beside
    The wrath of the Immortals, lest they call
    Yourselves one day to a severe account.
    I pray you by Olympian Jove, by her
    Whose voice convenes all councils, and again                      90
    Dissolves them, Themis, that henceforth ye cease,
    That ye permit me, oh my friends! to wear
    My days in solitary grief away,
    Unless Ulysses, my illustrious Sire,
    Hath in his anger any Greecian wrong'd,
    Whose wrongs ye purpose to avenge on me,
    Inciting these to plague me. Better far
    Were my condition, if yourselves consumed
    My substance and my revenue; from you
    I might obtain, perchance, righteous amends                      100
    Hereafter; you I might with vehement suit
    O'ercome, from house to house pleading aloud
    For recompense, till I at last prevail'd.
    But now, with darts of anguish ye transfix
    My inmost soul, and I have no redress.
      He spake impassion'd, and to earth cast down
    His sceptre, weeping. Pity at that sight
    Seiz'd all the people; mute the assembly sat
    Long time, none dared to greet Telemachus
    With answer rough, till of them all, at last,                    110
    Antinoues, sole arising, thus replied.
      Telemachus, intemp'rate in harangue,
    High-sounding orator! it is thy drift
    To make us all odious; but the offence
    Lies not with us the suitors; she alone
    Thy mother, who in subtlety excels,
    And deep-wrought subterfuge, deserves the blame.
    It is already the third year, and soon
    Shall be the fourth, since with delusive art
    Practising on their minds, she hath deceived                     120
    The Greecians; message after message sent
    Brings hope to each, by turns, and promise fair,
    But she, meantime, far otherwise intends.
    Her other arts exhausted all, she framed
    This stratagem; a web of amplest size
    And subtlest woof beginning, thus she spake.
    Princes, my suitors! since the noble Chief
    Ulysses is no more, press not as yet
    My nuptials, wait till I shall finish, first,
    A fun'ral robe (lest all my threads decay)                       130
    Which for the antient Hero I prepare,
    Laertes, looking for the mournful hour
    When fate shall snatch him to eternal rest;
    Else I the censure dread of all my sex,
    Should he, so wealthy, want at last a shroud.
    So spake the Queen, and unsuspicious, we
    With her request complied. Thenceforth, all day
    She wove the ample web, and by the aid
    Of torches ravell'd it again at night.
    Three years by such contrivance she deceived                     140
    The Greecians; but when (three whole years elaps'd)
    The fourth arriv'd, then, conscious of the fraud,
    A damsel of her train told all the truth,
    And her we found rav'ling the beauteous work.
    Thus, through necessity she hath, at length,
    Perform'd the task, and in her own despight.
    Now therefore, for the information clear
    Of thee thyself, and of the other Greeks,
    We answer. Send thy mother hence, with charge
    That him she wed on whom her father's choice                     150
    Shall fall, and whom she shall, herself, approve.
    But if by long procrastination still
    She persevere wearing our patience out,
    Attentive only to display the gifts
    By Pallas so profusely dealt to her,
    Works of surpassing skill, ingenious thought,
    And subtle shifts, such as no beauteous Greek
    (For aught that we have heard) in antient times
    E'er practised, Tyro, or Alcemena fair,
    Or fair Mycene, of whom none in art                              160
    E'er match'd Penelope, although we yield
    To this her last invention little praise,
    Then know, that these her suitors will consume
    So long thy patrimony and thy goods,
    As she her present purpose shall indulge,
    With which the Gods inspire her. Great renown
    She to herself insures, but equal woe
    And devastation of thy wealth to thee;
    For neither to our proper works at home
    Go we, of that be sure, nor yet elsewhere,                       170
    Till him she wed, to whom she most inclines.
      Him prudent, then, answer'd Telemachus.
    Antinoues! it is not possible
    That I should thrust her forth against her will,
    Who both produced and reared me. Be he dead,
    Or still alive, my Sire is far remote,
    And should I, voluntary, hence dismiss
    My mother to Icarius, I must much
    Refund, which hardship were and loss to me.
    So doing, I should also wrath incur                              180
    From my offended Sire, and from the Gods
    Still more; for she, departing, would invoke
    Erynnis to avenge her, and reproach
    Beside would follow me from all mankind.
    That word I, therefore, never will pronounce.
    No, if ye judge your treatment at her hands
    Injurious to you, go ye forth yourselves,
    Forsake my mansion; seek where else ye may
    Your feasts; consume your own; alternate feed
    Each at the other's cost. But if it seem                         190
    Wisest in your account and best to eat
    Voracious thus the patrimonial goods
    Of one man, rend'ring no account of all,
    Bite to the roots; but know that I will cry
    Ceaseless to the eternal Gods, in hope
    That Jove, in retribution of the wrong,
    Shall doom you, where ye have intruded, there
    To bleed, and of your blood ask no account.
      So spake Telemachus, and while he spake,
    The Thund'rer from a lofty mountain-top                          200
    Turn'd off two eagles; on the winds, awhile,
    With outspread pinions ample side by side
    They floated; but, ere long, hov'ring aloft,
    Right o'er the midst of the assembled Chiefs
    They wheel'd around, clang'd all their num'rous plumes,
    And with a downward look eyeing the throng,
    Death boded, ominous; then rending each
    The other's face and neck, they sprang at once
    Toward the right, and darted through the town.
    Amazement universal, at that sight,                              210
    Seized the assembly, and with anxious thought
    Each scann'd the future; amidst whom arose
    The Hero Halitherses, antient Seer,
    Offspring of Mastor; for in judgment he
    Of portents augural, and in forecast
    Unerring, his coevals all excell'd,
    And prudent thus the multitude bespake.
      Ye men of Ithaca, give ear! hear all!
    Though chief my speech shall to the suitors look,
    For, on their heads devolved, comes down the woe.                220
    Ulysses shall not from his friends, henceforth,
    Live absent long, but, hasting to his home,
    Comes even now, and as he comes, designs
    A bloody death for these, whose bitter woes
    No few shall share, inhabitants with us
    Of pleasant Ithaca; but let us frame
    Effectual means maturely to suppress
    Their violent deeds, or rather let themselves
    Repentant cease; and soonest shall be best.
    Not inexpert, but well-inform'd I speak                          230
    The future, and the accomplishment announce
    Of all which when Ulysses with the Greeks
    Embark'd for Troy, I to himself foretold.
    I said that, after many woes, and loss
    Of all his people, in the twentieth year,
    Unknown to all, he should regain his home,
    And my prediction shall be now fulfill'd.
      Him, then, Eurymachus thus answer'd rough
    The son of Polybus. Hence to thy house,
    Thou hoary dotard! there, prophetic, teach                       240
    Thy children to escape woes else to come.
    Birds num'rous flutter in the beams of day,
    Not all predictive. Death, far hence remote
    Hath found Ulysses, and I would to heav'n
    That, where he died, thyself had perish'd too.
    Thou hadst not then run o'er with prophecy
    As now, nor provocation to the wrath
    Giv'n of Telemachus, in hope to win,
    Perchance, for thine some favour at his hands.
    But I to _thee_ foretell, skilled as thou art                    250
    In legends old, (nor shall my threat be vain)
    That if by artifice thou move to wrath
    A younger than thyself, no matter whom,
    Woe first the heavier on himself shall fall,
    Nor shalt thou profit him by thy attempt,
    And we will charge thee also with a mulct,
    Which thou shalt pay with difficulty, and bear
    The burthen of it with an aching heart.
      As for Telemachus, I him advise,
    Myself, and press the measure on his choice                      260
    Earnestly, that he send his mother hence
    To her own father's house, who shall, himself,
    Set forth her nuptial rites, and shall endow
    His daughter sumptuously, and as he ought.
    For this expensive wooing, as I judge,
    Till then shall never cease; since we regard
    No man--no--not Telemachus, although
    In words exub'rant; neither fear we aught
    Thy vain prognostics, venerable sir!
    But only hate thee for their sake the more.                      270
    Waste will continue and disorder foul
    Unremedied, so long as she shall hold
    The suitors in suspense, for, day by day,
    Our emulation goads us to the strife,
    Nor shall we, going hence, seek to espouse
    Each his own comfort suitable elsewhere.
      To whom, discrete, Telemachus replied.
    Eurymachus, and ye the suitor train
    Illustrious, I have spoken: ye shall hear
    No more this supplication urged by me.                           280
    The Gods, and all the Greeks, now know the truth.
    But give me instantly a gallant bark
    With twenty rowers, skill'd their course to win
    To whatsoever haven; for I go
    To sandy Pylus, and shall hasten thence
    To Lacedemon, tidings to obtain
    Of my long-absent Sire, or from the lips
    Of man, or by a word from Jove vouchsafed
    Himself, best source of notice to mankind.
    If, there inform'd that still my father lives,                   290
    I hope conceive of his return, although
    Distress'd, I shall be patient yet a year.
    But should I learn, haply, that he survives
    No longer, then, returning, I will raise
    At home his tomb, will with such pomp perform
    His fun'ral rites, as his great name demands,
    And give my mother's hand to whom I may.
      This said, he sat, and after him arose
    Mentor, illustrious Ulysses' friend,
    To whom, embarking thence, he had consign'd                      300
    All his concerns, that the old Chief might rule
    His family, and keep the whole secure.
    Arising, thus the senior, sage, began.
      Hear me, ye Ithacans! be never King
    Henceforth, benevolent, gracious, humane
    Or righteous, but let every sceptred hand
    Rule merciless, and deal in wrong alone,
    Since none of all his people, whom he sway'd
    With such paternal gentleness and love,
    Remembers the divine Ulysses more!                               310
    That the imperious suitors thus should weave
    The web of mischief and atrocious wrong,
    I grudge not; since at hazard of their heads
    They make Ulysses' property a prey,
    Persuaded that the Hero comes no more.
    But much the people move me; how ye sit
    All mute, and though a multitude, yourselves,
    Opposed to few, risque not a single word
    To check the license of these bold intruders!
      Then thus Liocritus, Evenor's son.                             320
    Injurious Mentor! headlong orator!
    How dar'st thou move the populace against
    The suitors? Trust me they should find it hard,
    Numerous as they are, to cope with us,
    A feast the prize. Or should the King himself
    Of Ithaca, returning, undertake
    T' expell the jovial suitors from his house,
    Much as Penelope his absence mourns,
    His presence should afford her little joy;
    For fighting sole with many, he should meet                      330
    A dreadful death. Thou, therefore, speak'st amiss.
    As for Telemachus, let Mentor him
    And Halytherses furnish forth, the friends
    Long valued of his Sire, with all dispatch;
    Though him I judge far likelier to remain
    Long-time contented an enquirer here,
    Than to perform the voyage now proposed.
      Thus saying, Liocritus dissolved in haste
    The council, and the scattered concourse sought
    Their sev'ral homes, while all the suitors flock'd               340
    Thence to the palace of their absent King.
    Meantime, Telemachus from all resort
    Retiring, in the surf of the gray Deep
    First laved his hands, then, thus to Pallas pray'd.
      O Goddess! who wast yesterday a guest
    Beneath my roof, and didst enjoin me then
    A voyage o'er the sable Deep in quest
    Of tidings of my long regretted Sire!
    Which voyage, all in Ithaca, but most
    The haughty suitors, obstinate impede,                           350
    Now hear my suit and gracious interpose!
      Such pray'r he made; then Pallas, in the form,
    And with the voice of Mentor, drawing nigh,
    In accents wing'd, him kindly thus bespake.
      Telemachus! thou shalt hereafter prove
    Nor base, nor poor in talents. If, in truth,
    Thou have received from heav'n thy father's force
    Instill'd into thee, and resemblest him
    In promptness both of action and of speech,
    Thy voyage shall not useless be, or vain.                        360
    But if Penelope produced thee not
    His son, I, then, hope not for good effect
    Of this design which, ardent, thou pursuest.
    Few sons their fathers equal; most appear
    Degenerate; but we find, though rare, sometimes
    A son superior even to his Sire.
    And since thyself shalt neither base be found
    Nor spiritless, nor altogether void
    Of talents, such as grace thy royal Sire,
    I therefore hope success of thy attempt.                         370
    Heed not the suitors' projects; neither wise
    Are they, nor just, nor aught suspect the doom
    Which now approaches them, and in one day
    Shall overwhelm them all. No long suspense
    Shall hold thy purposed enterprise in doubt,
    Such help from me, of old thy father's friend,
    Thou shalt receive, who with a bark well-oar'd
    Will serve thee, and myself attend thee forth.
    But haste, join thou the suitors, and provide,
    In sep'rate vessels stow'd, all needful stores,                  380
    Wine in thy jars, and flour, the strength of man,
    In skins close-seam'd. I will, meantime, select
    Such as shall voluntary share thy toils.
    In sea-girt Ithaca new ships and old
    Abound, and I will chuse, myself, for thee
    The prime of all, which without more delay
    We will launch out into the spacious Deep.
      Thus Pallas spake, daughter of Jove; nor long,
    So greeted by the voice divine, remain'd
    Telemachus, but to his palace went                               390
    Distress'd in heart. He found the suitors there
    Goats slaying in the hall, and fatted swine
    Roasting; when with a laugh Antinoues flew
    To meet him, fasten'd on his hand, and said,
      Telemachus, in eloquence sublime,
    And of a spirit not to be controul'd!
    Give harbour in thy breast on no account
    To after-grudge or enmity, but eat,
    Far rather, cheerfully as heretofore,
    And freely drink, committing all thy cares                       400
    To the Achaians, who shall furnish forth
    A gallant ship and chosen crew for thee,
    That thou may'st hence to Pylus with all speed,
    Tidings to learn of thy illustrious Sire.
      To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.
    Antinoues! I have no heart to feast
    With guests so insolent, nor can indulge
    The pleasures of a mind at ease, with you.
    Is't not enough, suitors, that ye have used
    My noble patrimony as your own                                   410
    While I was yet a child? now, grown mature,
    And competent to understand the speech
    Of my instructors, feeling, too, a mind
    Within me conscious of augmented pow'rs,
    I will attempt your ruin, be assured,
    Whether at Pylus, or continuing here.
    I go, indeed, (nor shall my voyage prove
    Of which I speak, bootless or vain) I go
    An humble passenger, who neither bark
    Nor rowers have to boast my own, denied                          420
    That honour (so ye judg'd it best) by you.
      He said, and from Antinoues' hand his own
    Drew sudden. Then their delicate repast
    The busy suitors on all sides prepar'd,
    Still taunting as they toil'd, and with sharp speech
    Sarcastic wantoning, of whom a youth,
    Arrogant as his fellows, thus began.
      I see it plain, Telemachus intends
    Our slaughter; either he will aids procure
    From sandy Pylus, or will bring them arm'd                       430
    From Sparta; such is his tremendous drift.
    Even to fruitful Ephyre, perchance,
    He will proceed, seeking some baneful herb
    Which cast into our cup, shall drug us all.
      To whom some haughty suitor thus replied.
    Who knows but that himself, wand'ring the sea
    From all his friends and kindred far remote,
    May perish like Ulysses? Whence to us
    Should double toil ensue, on whom the charge
    To parcel out his wealth would then devolve,                     440
    And to endow his mother with the house
    For his abode whom she should chance to wed.
      So sported they; but he, ascending sought
    His father's lofty chamber, where his heaps
    He kept of brass and gold, garments in chests,
    And oils of fragrant scent, a copious store.
    There many a cask with season'd nectar fill'd
    The grape's pure juice divine, beside the wall
    Stood orderly arranged, waiting the hour
    (Should e'er such hour arrive) when, after woes                  450
    Num'rous, Ulysses should regain his home.
    Secure that chamber was with folding doors
    Of massy planks compact, and night and day,
    Within it antient Euryclea dwelt,
    Guardian discrete of all the treasures there,
    Whom, thither call'd, Telemachus address'd.
      Nurse! draw me forth sweet wine into my jars,
    Delicious next to that which thou reserv'st
    For our poor wand'rer; if escaping death
    At last, divine Ulysses e'er return.                             460
