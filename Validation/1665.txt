           as follows: (Here) stands the doomed sacrifice for the

           [Footnote 279: _Huli-wale_. To turn about, here used as the
           name of a place, is evidently intended figuratively to stand

           This fragment--two fragments, in fact, pieced
           together--belongs to the epic of Pele. As her little sister,
           Hiiaka, is about to start on her adventurous journey to bring
           the handsome Prince Lohiau from the distant island of Kauai
           she is overcome by a premonition of Pole's jealousy and
           vengeance, and she utters this intercession.

           The formalities just described speak for themselves. They
           mark better than any comments can do the superstitious
           devotion of the old-timers to formalism, their remoteness
           from that free touch of social and artistic pleasure, the
           lack of which we moderns often lament in our own lives and
           sigh for as a lost art, conceiving it to have been once the
           possession of "the children of nature."

           The author has already hinted at the form and character of
           the entertainments with which hula-folk sometimes beguiled
           their professional interludes. Fortunately the author is able
           to illustrate by means of a song the very form of
           entertainment they provided for themselves on such an
           occasion. The following mele, cantillated with an
           accompaniment of expressive gesture, is one that was actually
           given at an awa-drinking bout indulged in by hula-folk. The
           author has an account of its recital at Kahuku, island of
           Oahu, so late as the year 1849, during a circuit of that
[Page 130] island made by King Kamehameha III. This mele is reckoned as
           belonging to the ordinary repertory of the hula; but to which
           particular form of the dance it was devoted has not been
           learned:

           which remain to this day. Torches made from the nuts of these
           trees were supposed to be of superior quality and they
           furnished the illumination for the revelries of Kane and his
           fellows.]

[Page 131]

           Kane, the chief god of the Hawaiian pantheon, in company with
           other immortals, his boon companions, met in revelry on the
           heights bounding Wai-pi'o valley. With each potation of awa
           they sounded a blast upon their conch-shells, and the racket
           was almost continuous from the setting of the sun until
           drowsiness overcame them or the coming of day put an end to
           their revels.

           The tumult of sound made it impossible for the priests to
           perform acceptably the offices of religion, and the pious
           king, Liloa, was distressed beyond measure. The whole valley
           was disturbed and troubled with forebodings at the suspension
           of divine worship.

           The chief offender was Kane himself. The trumpet which he
           held to his lips was a conch of extraordinary size (pl. XIV)
           and credited with a divine origin and the possession of
           supernatural power; its note was heard above all the others.
           This shell, the famed Kiha-pu, had been stolen from the heiau
           of Paka'a-lana, Liloa's temple in Waipi'o valley, and-after
           many-adventures had come into the hands of god Kane, who used
           it, as we see, for the interruption of the very services that
           were intended for his honor.

           The relief from this novel and unprecedented situation came
           from an unexpected quarter. King Liloa's awa-patches were
           found to be suffering from the nocturnal visits of a thief. A
           watch was set; the thief proved to be a dog, Puapua-lenalena,
           whose master was a confirmed awa-toper. When master and dog
           were brought into the presence of King Liloa, the shrewd
           monarch divined the remarkable character of the animal, and
           at his suggestion the dog was sent on the errand which
           resulted in the recovery by stealth of the famed conch
           Kiha-pu. As a result of his loss of the conch, Kane put an
           end to his revels, and the valley of Wai-pi'o again had
           peace.

           This mele is an admirable specimen of Hawaiian poetry, and
           may be taken as representative of the best product of
           Hawaii's classical period. The language is elegant and
           concise, free from the redundancies that so often load down
           Hawaiian compositions. No one, it is thought, will deny to
           the subject-matter of this mele an unusual degree of
           interest.

           There is a historic side to the story of the conch-shell
           Kiha-pu. Not many years ago the Hawaiian Museum contained an
           ethnological specimen of great interest, the conch-shell
           Kiha-pu. It was fringed, after the fashion of a witch-doll,
           with strings, beads, and wampumlike bits of mother-of-pearl,
           and had great repute as a _kupua_ or luckbringer. King
           Kalakaua, who affected a sentimental leaning to the notions
           of his mother's race, took possession of this famous "curio"
           and it disappeared from public view.

                             XIX.--THE HULA MAU-KANI


           The hula _niau-kani_ was one of the classic dances of the
           halau, and took its name from the musical instrument that was
           its accompaniment. This was a simple, almost extemporaneous,
           contrivance, constructed, like the Jew's-harp, on the
           principle of a reed instrument. It was made of two parts, a
           broad piece of bamboo with a longitudinal slit at one end and
           a thin narrow piece of the same material, the reed, which was
           held firmly against the fenestra on the concave side of part
           number one. The convexity of the instrument was pressed
           against the lips and the sound was produced by projecting
           the breath through the slit in a speaking or singing tone in
           such a way as to cause vibrations in the reed. The manner of
           constructing and operating this reed instrument is suggestive
           of the jew's-harp. It is asserted by those who should know
           that the niau-kani was an instrument of purely Hawaiian
           invention.

           The performer did not depend simply upon the musical tone,
           but rather upon the modification it produced in the
           utterances that were strained through it. It would certainly
           require a quick ear, much practice, and a thorough
           acquaintance with the peculiarities of Hawaiian mele to
           enable one to distinguish the words of a song after being
           transformed by passage through the niau-kani.

           As late as about thirty or forty years ago the niau-kani was
           often seen in the hands of the native Hawaiian youth, who
           used it as a means of romantic conversations and flirtation.
           Since the coming in of the Portuguese and their importation
           of the _uku-lele_, the _taro-patch-fiddle_, and other cheap
           stringed instruments, the niau-kani has left the field to
           them and disappeared.

           The author's informant saw the niau-kani dance performed some
           years ago at Moana-lua, near Honolulu, and again on the
           island of Kauai. The dance in each case was the same. The
           kumu, aided by a pupil, stood and played on the niau-kani,
           straining the cantillations through the reed-protected
           aperture, while the olapa, girls, kept time to the music with
           the movements of their dancing,

           meaning--such, for instance, as our "jack-in-the-box"--have
           come to be used as a noun for the sake of the meaning wrapped
           up in the etymology. This figure of speech is, no doubt,
           common to all languages, markedly so in the Hawaiian. It may

            5   The forest of bloom at Koili,
[Page 134]      To give love-caress to Manu'a,
                And her neighbor Maha-moku,
                And see the waters flash at Mono-lau;
                My hand would quiet their rage,
           10   Would sidle and touch Lani-huli.
                Grant me but this one entreaty,
                We'll meet 'neath the omens above.
                Two flowers there are that bloom
                In your garden of being;
           15   Entwine them into a garland,
                Fit emblem and crown of our love.
                And what the hour of your coming?
                When stands the Sun o'er the pali,
                When turns the breeze of the land,
           20   To breathe the perfume of hala,
                While the currents swirl at Wai-pa.

           This mele is the language of passion, a song in which the
           lover frankly pours into the ear of his inamorata the story
           of his love up to the time of his last enthrallment. Verses
           11, 12, and 17 are the language of the woman. The scene is
           laid in the rainy valley of Hanalei, Kauai, a broad and deep
           basin, to the finishing of which the elements have
           contributed their share. The rush and roar of the waters that
           unite to form the river Wai-oli, from their wild tumbling in
           the falls of Molo-kama till they pass the river's mouth and
           mingle with the flashing waves of the ocean at Mono-lau,
           _Anapa i ke kai o Mono-lau_ (verse 8), are emblematic of the
           man's passion and his quest for satisfaction.

                               XX.--THE HULA OHE


           The action of the hula _ohe_ had some resemblance to one of
           the figures of the Virginia reel. The dancers, ranged in two
           parallel rows, moved forward with an accompaniment of
           gestures until the head of each row had reached the limit in
           that direction, and then, turning outward to right and left,
           countermarched in the same manner to the point of starting,
           and so continued to do. They kept step and timed their
           gestures and movements to the music of the bamboo nose-flute,
           the _ohe_.

           In a performance of this hula witnessed by an informant the
           chorus of dancers was composed entirely of girls, while the
           kumu operated the nose-flute and at the same time led the
           cantillation of the mele. This seemed an extraordinary
           statement, and the author challenged the possibility of a
           person blowing with the nose into a flute and at the same
           time uttering words with the mouth. The Hawaiian asserted,
           nevertheless, that, the leader of the hula, the kumu, did
           accomplish these two functions; yet his answer did not remove
           doubt that they were accomplished jointly and at the same
           time. The author is inclined to think that the kumu performed
           the two actions alternately.

           The musical range of the nose-flute was very limited; it had
           but two or, at the most, three stops. The player with his
           left hand held the flute to the nostril, at the same time
           applying a finger of the same hand to keep the other nostril
           closed. With the fingers of his right hand he operated the
           stops (pl. xv).

           [Footnote 296: _Ka-wai-kini_. The name of a rocky bluff that
           stands on the side of Mount Wai-ale-ale, looking to Wailua.
           It as said to divide the flow from the great morass, the
           natural reservoir formed by the hollow at the top of the
           mountain, turning a part of it in the direction of Wai-niha,
           a valley not far from Hanalei, which otherwise would, it is
           said by Hawaiians, go to swell the stream that forms the
           Wailua river. This rock, in the old times, was regarded as a
           demigod, a _kupua_, and had a lover who resided in Wai-lua,
           also another who resided in the mountains. The words in the
           first two or three verses may be taken as if they were the
           utterance of this Wai-lua lover, saying "I will go up and see
           my sweetheart Ka-wai-kini."]

           [Footnote 297: _Pihana-ka-lani_. Literally, the fullness of
           heaven. This was a forest largely of lehua that covered the
           mountain slope below Ka-wai-kini. It seems as if the purpose
           of its mention was to represent the beauties and charms of
           the human body. In this romantic region lived the famous
           mythological princes--_alii kupua_, the Hawaiians called
           them--named _Kaua-kahi-alii_ and _Aiwohi-kupua_, with their
           princess sister _Ka-hale-lehua_. The second name mentioned
           was the one who married the famous heroine of the romantic
           story of _Laie-i-ka-wai_.]

           [Footnote 298: _Manu hulu ma'ema'e_. An allusion to the great
           number of plumage birds that were reputed to be found in this
           place.]

           [Footnote 299: _Puna-hele ia Kaua-kahi-alli_. The birds of the
           region are said to have been on very intimate and friendly
           terms with Kaua-kahi-alii. (See note _b_, p. 135.)]

           [Footnote 300: _Kaili_. The full form is said to be
           _Ka-ili-lau-o-ke-koa_--Skin-like-the-leaf-of-the-koa. In the
           text of the mele this name is analyzed into its parts and
           written as if the phrase at the end were an appellative and
           not an integral part of the name itself. This was a mythical
           character of unusual beauty, a person of superhuman power,
           _kupua_, a mistress of the art of surf-riding, which passion
           she indulged in the waters about Wai-lua.]

           [Footnote 301: _Hooipo-i-ka-Malanai_. A mythical princess of
           Wailua, the grandmother of Kaili. This oft-quoted phrase,
           literally meaning to make love in the (gently-blowing)
           trade-wind, has become almost a stock expression, standing
           for romantic love, or love-making.]

           [Footnote 302: _Lehua-wehe_. The piece of ocean near the mouth
           of the Wailua river in which Kaili indulged her passion for
           surf-riding.]

           [Footnote 303: _Kalu-kalu o Kewa_. _Kalu-kalu_ may mean a
           species of soft, smooth grass specially fitted for sliding
           upon, which flourished on the inclined plain of Kewa, Kauai.
           One would sit upon a mat, the butt end of a coconut leaf, or
           a sled, while another dragged it along. The Hawaiian name for
           this sport is _pahe'e_. _Kalu-kalu_ is also the name applied
           to "a very thin gauze-like kapa." (See Andrews's Hawaiian
           Dictionary.) If we suppose the poet to have clearly intended
           the first meaning, the figure does not tally with the
           following verse, the fifteenth. Verses 14 and 15 would thus
           be made to read:

                I desire the kalu-kalu (grass) of Kewa,
                That is riding the surf of Maka-iwa.

           This is an impossible figure and makes no sense. If, on the
           other hand, we take another version and conceive that the
           bard had in mind the gauze-like robe of _kalu-kalu_--using
           this, of course, as a figure for the person clad in such a
           robe--the rendering I have given,

                I pine for the sylph, robed in gauze,
                Who rides the surf Maka-iwa,

           would not only make a possible, but a poetic, picture. Let
           the critical reader judge which of these two versions hits
           closer to common sense and probability.]

                Darling of blooming Lehua.

                On the surge that enthralls the desire.
           15   I pine for the sylph robed in gauze,
                Who rides on the surf Maka-iwa--
                Aye, cynosure thou of all hearts,
                In all of sacred Wailua.
                Forlorn and soul-empty the house;
           20   You pleasure on the beach Ali-o;
                Your love is up here in the wildwood.

           This mele hoipoipo, love-song, like the one previously given,
           is from Kauai. The proper names that abound in it, whether of
           places, of persons, or of winds, seem to have been mostly of
           Kauaian origin, furnished by its topography, its myths and
           legends. They have, however, become the common property of
           the whole group through having been interwoven in the
           national songs that pass current from island to island.

           XXI.--THE MUSIC AND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS OF THE HAWAIIANS


           A bird is easier captured than the notes of a song. The
           _mele_ and _oli_ of Hawaii's olden time have been preserved
           for us; but the music to which they were chanted, a less
           perdurable essence, has mostly exhaled. In the sudden
           transition from the tabu system to the new order of things
           that came in with the death of Kamehameha in 1819, the old
           fashion of song soon found itself antiquated and
           outdistanced. Its survival, so far as it did survive, was
           rather as a memorial and remembrance of the past than as a
           register of the living emotions of the present.

           The new music, with its _pa, ko, li_--answering to our do,
           re, mi[304]--was soon in everybody's mouth. From the first it
           was evidently destined to enact a role different from that of
           the old cantillation; none the less the musical ideas that
           came in with it, the air of freedom from tabu and priestcraft
           it breathed, and the diatonic scale, the highway along which
           it marched to conquest, soon produced a noticeable reaction
           in all the musical efforts of the people. This new seed, when
           it had become a vigorous plant, began to push aside the old
           indigenous stock, to cover it with new growths, and,
           incredible as it may seem, to inoculate it with its own
           pollen, thus producing a cross which to-day is accepted in
           certain quarters as the genuine article of Hawaiian song.
           Even now, the people of northwestern America are listening
           with demonstrative interest to songs which they suppose to be
           those of the old hula, but which in reality have no more
           connection with that institution than our negro minstrelsy
           has to do with the dark continent.
