
'The proof' Henry said sharply. 'Give me that!'

'I can give it in a week from this day.'

'It must be no idle tale, mind you,' the king continued suspiciously.

'You shall have Turenne's designs, sire, from one who had them from his
own mouth.'

The king looked startled, but after a pause turned and resumed his walk.
'Well,' he said, 'if you do that, I on my part--'

The rest I lost, for the two passing to the farther end of the gallery,
came to a standstill there, balking my curiosity and Rambouillet's also.
The marquis, indeed, began to betray his impatience, and the great clock
immediately over our heads presently striking the half-hour after ten,
he started and made as if he would have approached the king. He checked
the impulse, however, but still continued to fidget uneasily, losing his
reserve by-and-by so far as to whisper to me that his Majesty would be
missed.

I had been, up to this point, a silent and inactive spectator of a
scene which appealed to my keenest interests and aroused my most ardent
curiosity. Surprise following surprise, I had begun to doubt my own
identity; so little had I expected to find myself first in the presence
of the Most Christian King--and that under circumstances as strange and
bizarre as could well be imagined--and then an authorised witness at
a negotiation upon which the future of all the great land of France
stretching for so many hundred leagues on every side of us, depended. I
say I could scarcely believe in my own identity; or that I was the same
Gaston de Marsac who had slunk, shabby and out-at-elbows, about St. Jean
d'Angely. I tasted the first sweetness of secret power, which men say is
the sweetest of all and the last relinquished; and, the hum of
distant voices and laughter still reaching me at intervals, I began to
understand why we had been admitted with, so much precaution, and to
comprehend the gratification of M. de Rosny when the promise of this
interview first presented to him the hope of effecting so much for his
master and for France.

Now I was to be drawn into the whirlpool itself. I was still travelling
back over the different stages of the adventure which had brought me to
this point, when I was rudely awakened by M. de Rosny calling my name
in a raised voice. Seeing, somewhat late, that he was beckoning to me
to approach, I went forward in a confused and hasty fashion; kneeling
before the king as I had seen him kneel, and then rising to give ear to
his Majesty's commands. Albeit, having expected nothing less than to be
called upon, I was not in the clearest mood to receive them. Nor was my
bearing such as I could have wished it to be.

M. de Rosny tells me that you desire a commission at Court, sir,' the
king said quickly.

'I, sire?' I stammered, scarcely able to believe my ears. I was so
completely taken aback that I could say no more, and I stopped there
with my mouth open.

'There are few things I can deny M. de Rosny,' Henry continued, speaking
very rapidly, 'and I am told that you are a gentleman of birth and
ability. Out of kindness to him, therefore, I grant you a commission to
raise twenty men for my service. Rambouillet,' he continued, raising
his voice slightly, 'you will introduce this gentleman to me publicly
to-morrow, that; I may carry into effect my intention on his behalf. You
may go now, sir. No thanks. And M. de Rosny,' he added, turning to my
companion and speaking with energy, 'have a care for my sake that you
are not recognised as you go. Rambouillet must contrive something to
enable you to leave without peril. I should be desolated if anything
happened to you, my friend, for I could not protect you. I give you my
word if Mendoza or Retz found you in Blois I could not save you from
them unless you recanted.'

'I will not trouble either your Majesty or my conscience,' M. de Rosny
replied, bowing low, 'if my wits can help me.'

'Well, the saints keep you,' the king answered piously, going towards
the door by which he had entered; 'for your master and I have both need
of you. Rambouillet, take care of him as you love me. And come early in
the morning to my closet and tell me how it has fared with him.'

We all stood bowing while he withdrew, and only turned to retire when
the door closed behind him. Burning with indignation and chagrin as
I was at finding myself disposed of in the way I have described, and
pitchforked, whether I would or no, into a service I neither fancied
nor desired, I still managed for the present to restrain myself; and,
permitting my companions to precede me, followed in silence, listening
sullenly to their jubilations. The marquis seemed scarcely less pleased
than M. de Rosny; and as the latter evinced a strong desire to lessen
any jealousy the former might feel, and a generous inclination to
attribute to him a full share of the credit gained, I remained the
only person dissatisfied with the evening's events. We retired from the
chateau with the same precautions which had marked our entrance, and
parting with M. de Rambouillet at the door of our lodging--not without
many protestations of esteem on his part and of gratitude on that of
M. de Rosny--mounted to the first-floor in single file and in silence,
which I was determined not to be the first to break.

Doubtless M. de Rosny knew my thoughts, for, speedily dismissing Maignan
and Simon, who were in waiting, he turned to me without preface. 'Come,
my friend,' he said, laying his hand on my shoulder and looking me in
the face in a way which all but disarmed me at once, 'do not let us
misunderstand one another. You think you have cause to be angry with me.
I cannot suffer that, for the King of Navarre had never greater need of
your services than now.'

'You have played me an unworthy trick, sir,'I answered, thinking he
would cozen me with fair speeches.

'Tut, tut!' he replied. 'You do not understand.'

'I understand well enough,' I answered, with bitterness, 'that, having
done the King of Navarre's work, he would now be rid of me.'

'Have I not told you,' M. de Rosny replied, betraying for the first time
some irritation, 'that he has greater need of your services than ever?
Come, man, be reasonable, or, better still, listen to me.' And turning
from me, he began to walk up and down the room, his hands behind him.
'the King of France--I want to make it as clear to you as possible--'
he said, 'cannot make head against the League without help, and,
willy-nilly, must look for it to the Huguenots whom he has so long
persecuted. The King of Navarre, their acknowledged leader, has offered
that help; and so, to spite my master, and prevent a combination so
happy for France, has M. de Turenne, who would fain raise the faction he
commands to eminence, and knows well how to make his profit out of the
dissensions of his country. Are you clear so far, sir?'

I assented. I was becoming absorbed in spite of myself.

'Very well,' he resumed. 'This evening--never did anything fall out more
happily than Rambouillet's meeting with me--he is a good man!--I
have brought the king to this: that if proof of the selfish nature of
Turenne's designs be laid before him he will hesitate no longer. That
proof exists. A fortnight ago it was here; but it is not here now.'

'That is unlucky!' I exclaimed. I was so much interested in his story,
as well as flattered by the confidence he was placing in me, that my
ill-humour vanished. I went and stood with my shoulder against the
mantelpiece, and he, passing to and fro between me and the light,
continued his tale.

'A word about this proof,' he said. 'It came into the King of Navarre's
hands before its full value was known to us, for that only accrued to
it on M. de Guise's death. A month ago it--this piece of evidence I
mean--was at Chize. A fortnight or so ago it was here in Blois. It
is now, 'M. de Marsac,' he continued, facing me suddenly as he came
opposite me, 'in my house at Rosny.'

I started. 'You mean Mademoiselle de la Vire?' I cried.

'I mean Mademoiselle de la Vire!' he answered, 'who, some month or two
ago, overheard M. de Turenne's plans, and contrived to communicate
with the King of Navarre. Before the latter could arrange a private
interview, however, M. de Turenne got wind of her dangerous knowledge,
and swept her off to Chize. The rest you know, M. de Marsac, if any man
knows it.'

'But what will you do?' I asked. 'She is at Rosny.'

'Maignan, whom I trust implicitly, as far as his lights go, will start
to fetch her to-morrow. At the same hour I start southwards. You, M.
de Marsac, will remain here as my agent, to watch over my interests,
to receive Mademoiselle on her arrival, to secure for her a secret
interview with the king, to guard her while she remains here. Do you
understand?'

Did I understand? I could not find words in which to thank him. My
remorse and gratitude, my sense of the wrong I had done him, and of the
honour he was doing me, were such that I stood mute before him as I had
stood before the king. 'You accept, then?' he said, smiling. 'You do not
deem the adventure beneath you, my friend?'

'I deserve your confidence so little, sir,' I answered, stricken to the
ground, 'that I beg you to speak, while I listen. By attending exactly
to your instructions I may prove worthy of the trust reposed in me. And
only so.'

He embraced me again and again, with a kindness which moved me almost
to tears. 'You are a man after my own heart,' he said, 'and if God wills
I will make your fortune. Now listen, my friend. To-morrow at Court, as
a stranger and a man introduced by Rambouillet, you will be the cynosure
of all eyes. Bear yourself bravely. Pay court to the women, but attach
yourself to no one in particular. Keep aloof from Retz and the Spanish
faction, but beware especially of Bruhl. He alone will have your secret,
and may suspect your design. Mademoiselle should be here in a week;
while she is with you, and until she has seen the king, trust no one,
suspect everyone, fear all things. Consider the battle won only when the
king says, "I am satisfied."'

Much more he told me, which served its purpose and has been forgotten.
Finally he honoured me by bidding me share his pallet with him, that we
might talk without restraint, and that if anything occurred to him in
the night he might communicate it to me.

'But will not Bruhl denounce me as a Huguenot?' I asked him.

'He will not dare to do so,' M. de Rosny answered, 'both as a Huguenot
himself, and as his master's representative; and, further, because it
would displease the king. No, but whatever secret harm one man can
do another, that you have to fear. Maignan, when he returns with
mademoiselle, will leave two men with you; until they come I should
borrow a couple of stout fellows from Rambouillet. Do not go out alone
after dark, and beware of doorways, especially your own.'

A little later, when I thought him asleep, I heard him chuckle; and
rising on my elbow I asked him what it was. 'Oh, it is your affair,'
he answered, still laughing silently, so that I felt the mattress shake
under him. 'I don't envy you one part of your task, my friend.'

'What is that?' I said suspiciously.

'Mademoiselle,' he answered, stifling with difficulty a burst of
laughter. And after that he would not say another word, bad, good, or
indifferent, though I felt the bed shake more than once, and knew that
he was digesting his pleasantry.



CHAPTER XVI. IN THE KING'S CHAMBER.

M. de Rosny had risen from my side and started on his journey when I
opened my eyes in the morning, and awoke to the memory of the task which
had been so strangely imposed upon me; and which might, according as
the events of the next fortnight shaped themselves, raise me to high
position or put an end to my career. He had not forgotten to leave
a souvenir behind him, for I found beside my pillow a handsome
silver-mounted pistol, bearing the letter 'R.' and a coronet; nor had
I more than discovered this instance of his kindness before Simon Fleix
came in to tell me that M. de Rosny had left two hundred crowns in his
hands for me.

'Any message with it?' I asked the lad.

'Only that; he had taken a keepsake in exchange,' Simon answered,
opening the window as he spoke.

In some wonder I began to search, but I could not discover that anything
was missing until I came to put on my doublet, when I found that the
knot of ribbon which mademoiselle had flung to me at my departure from
Rosny was gone from the inside of the breast, where I had pinned it for
safety with a long thorn. The discovery that M. de Rosny had taken this
was displeasing to me on more than one account. In the first place,
whether mademoiselle had merely wished to plague me (as was most
probable) or not, I was loth to lose it, my day for ladies' favours
being past and gone; in the second, I misdoubted the motive which
had led him to purloin it, and tormented myself with thinking of the
different constructions he might put upon it, and the disparaging view
of my trust worthiness which it might lead him to take. I blamed myself
much for my carelessness in leaving it where a chance eye might rest
upon it; and more when, questioning Simon further, I learned that M.
de Rosny had added, while mounting at the door, 'Tell your master, safe
bind, safe find; and a careless lover makes a loose mistress.'

I felt my cheek burn in a manner unbecoming my years while Simon with
some touch of malice repeated this; and I made a vow on the spot, which
I kept until I was tempted to break it, to have no more to do with such
trifles. Meanwhile, I had to make the best of it; and brisking up, and
bidding Simon, who seemed depressed by the baron's departure, brisk up
also, I set about my preparations for making such a figure at Court
as became me: procuring a black velvet suit, and a cap and feather to
match; item, a jewelled clasp to secure the feather; with a yard or two
of lace and two changes of fine linen.

Simon had grown sleek at Rosny, and losing something of the wildness
which had marked him, presented in the dress M. de Rosny had given him
a very creditable appearance; being also, I fancy, the only equerry in
Blois who could write. A groom I engaged on the recommendation of M. de
Rambouillet's master of the horse; and I gave out also that I required a
couple of valets. It needed only an hour under the barber's hands and a
set of new trappings for the Cid to enable me to make a fair show, such
as might be taken to indicate a man of ten or twelve thousand livres a
year.

In this way I expended a hundred and fifteen crowns reflecting that
this was a large sum, and that I must keep some money for play, I was
glad to learn that in the crowded state of the city even men with high
rank were putting up with poor lodging; I determined, therefore, to
combine economy with a scheme which I had in my head by taking the rooms
in which my mother died, with one room below them. This I did, hiring
such furniture as I needed, which was not a great deal. To Simon Fleix,
whose assistance in these matters was invaluable, I passed on much of M.
de Rosny's advice, bidding him ruffle it with the best in his station,
and inciting him to labour for my advancement by promising to make his
fortune whenever my own should be assured. I hoped, indeed, to derive
no little advantage from the quickness of wit; which had attracted M. de
Rosny's attention; although I did not fail to take into account at the
same time that the lad was wayward and fitful, prone at one time to
depression, and at another to giddiness, and equally uncertain in either
mood.

M. de Rambouillet being unable to attend the LEVEE, had appointed me to
wait upon him at six in the evening; at which hour I presented myself at
his lodgings, attended by Simon Fleix. I found him in the midst of
half a dozen gentlemen whose habit it was to attend him upon all public
occasions; and these gallants, greeting me with the same curious and
suspicious glances which I have seen hounds bestow on a strange dog
introduced into their kennel, I was speedily made to feel that it is one
thing to have business at Court, and another to be well received there.

M. de Rambouillet, somewhat to my surprise, did nothing to remove
this impression. On all ordinary occasions a man of stiff and haughty
bearing, and thoroughly disliking, though he could not prevent, the
intrusion of a third party into a transaction which promised an infinity
of credit, he received me so coldly and with so much reserve as for the
moment to dash my spirits and throw me back on myself.

During the journey to the castle, however, which we performed on foot,
attended by half a dozen armed servants bearing torches, I had time to
recall M. de Rosny's advice, and to bethink me of the intimacy which
that great man had permitted me; with so much effect in the way of
heartening me, that as we crossed the courtyard of the castle I
advanced myself, not without some murmuring on the part of others, to
Rambouillet's elbow, considering that as I was attached to him by the
king's command, this was my proper place. I had no desire to quarrel,
however, and persisted for some time in disregarding the nudges and
muttered words which were exchanged round me, and even the efforts which
were made as we mounted the stairs to oust me from my position. But
a young gentleman, who showed himself very forward in these attempts,
presently stumbling against me, I found it necessary to look at him.

'Sir,' he said, in a small and lisping voice, 'you trod on my toe.'

Though I had not done so, I begged his pardon very politely. But as his
only acknowledgment of this courtesy consisted in an attempt to get his
knee in front of mine--we were mounting very slowly, the stairs being
cumbered with a multitude of servants, who stood on either hand--I did
tread on his toe, with a force and directness which made him cry out.

'What is the matter?' Rambouillet asked, looking back hastily.

'Nothing, M. le Marquis,' I answered, pressing on steadfastly.

'Sir,' my young friend said again, in the same lisping voice, 'you trod
on my toe.'

'I believe I did, sir,' I answered.

'You have not yet apologised,' he murmured gently in my ear.

'Nay, there you are wrong,' I rejoined bluntly, 'for it is always my
habit to apologise first and tread afterwards.'

He smiled as at a pleasant joke; and I am bound to say that his bearing
was so admirable that if he had been my son I could have hugged him.
'Good!' he answered. 'No doubt your sword is as sharp as your wits,
sir. I see,' he continued, glancing naively at my old scabbard--he
was himself the very gem of a courtier, a slender youth with a
pink-and-white complexion, a dark line for a moustache, and a pearl-drop
in his ear--'it is longing to be out. Perhaps you will take a turn in
the tennis-court to-morrow?'

'With pleasure, sir,' I answered, 'if you have a father, or your elder
brother is grown up.'

What answer he would have made to this gibe I do not know, for at that
moment we reached the door of the ante-chamber; and this being narrow,
and a sentry in the grey uniform of the Swiss Guard compelling all to
enter in single file, my young friend was forced to fall back, leaving
me free to enter alone, and admire at my leisure a scene at once
brilliant and sombre.

The Court being in mourning for the Queen-mother, black predominated
in the dresses of those present, and set off very finely the gleaming
jewels and gemmed sword-hilts which were worn by the more important
personages. The room was spacious and lofty, hung with arras, and lit by
candles burning in silver sconces; it rang as we entered with the shrill
screaming of a parrot, which was being teased by a group occupying the
farther of the two hearths. Near them play was going on at one table,
and primero at a second. In a corner were three or four ladies, in
a circle about a red-faced, plebeian-looking man, who was playing at
forfeits with one of their number; while the middle of the room
seemed dominated by a middle-sized man with a peculiarly inflamed and
passionate countenance, who, seated on a table, was inveighing against
someone or something in the most violent terms, his language being
interlarded with all kinds of strange and forcible oaths. Two or three
gentlemen, who had the air of being his followers, stood about him,
listening between submission and embarrassment; while beside the nearer
fireplace, but at some distance from him, lounged a nobleman, very
richly dressed, and wearing on his breast the Cross of the Holy Ghost;
who seemed to be the object of his invective, but affecting to ignore it
was engaged in conversation with a companion. A bystander muttering that
Crillon had been drinking, I discovered with immense surprise that the
declaimer on the table was that famous soldier; and I was still looking
at him in wonder--for I had been accustomed all my life to associate
courage with modesty--when, the door of the chamber suddenly opening, a
general movement in that direction took place. Crillon, disregarding all
precedency, sprang from his table and hurried first to the threshold.
The Baron de Biron, on the other hand--for the gentleman by the fire was
no other--waited, in apparent ignorance of the slight which was being
put upon him, until M. de Rambouillet came up; then he went forward
with him. Keeping close to my patron's elbow, I entered the chamber
immediately behind him.

Crillon had already seized upon the king, and, when we entered, was
stating his grievance is a voice not much lower than that which he had
used outside. M. de Biron, seeing this, parted from the marquis, and,
going aside with his former companion, sat down on a trunk against the
wall; while Rambouillet, followed by myself and three or four gentlemen
of his train, advanced to the king, who was standing near the alcove.
His Majesty seeing him, and thankful, I think, for the excuse, waved
Crillon off. 'Tut, tut! You told me all that this morning,' he said
good-naturedly. 'And here is Rambouillet, who has, I hope, something
fresh to tell. Let him speak to me. Sanctus! Don't look at me as if
you would run me through, man. Go and quarrel with someone of your own
size.'

Crillon at this retired grumbling, and Henry, who had just risen from
primero with the Duke of Nevers, nodded to Rambouillet. 'Well, my
friend, anything fresh?' he cried. He was more at his ease and looked
more cheerful than at our former interview; yet still care and suspicion
lurked about his peevish mouth, and in the hollows under his gloomy
eyes. 'A new guest, a new face, or a new game--which have you brought?'

'In a sense, sire, a new face,' the marquis answered, bowing, and
standing somewhat aside that I might have place.

'Well, I cannot say much for the pretty baggage,' quoth the king
quickly. And amid a general titter he extended his hand to me. 'I'll
be sworn, though,' he continued, as I rose from my knee, 'that you want
something, my friend?'

'Nay, sire,' I answered, holding up my head boldly--for Crillon's
behaviour had been a further lesson to me--'I have, by your leave, the
advantage. For your Majesty has supplied me with a new jest. I see many
new faces round me, and I have need only of a new game. If your Majesty
would be pleased to grant me--'

'There! Said I not so?' cried the king, raising his hand with a laugh.
'He does want something. But he seems not undeserving. What does he
pray, Rambouillet?'

'A small command,' M. de Rambouillet answered, readily playing his
part. 'And your Majesty would oblige me if you could grant the Sieur de
Marsac's petition. I will answer for it he is a man of experience.'

'Chut! A small command?' Henry ejaculated, sitting down suddenly in
apparent ill-humour. 'It is what everyone wants--when they do not want
big ones. Still, I suppose,' he continued, taking up a comfit-box, which
lay beside him, and opening it, 'if you do not get what you want for him
you will sulk like the rest, my friend.'

'Your Majesty has never had cause to complain of me,' quoth the Marquis,
forgetting his role, or too proud to play it.

'Tut, tut, tut, tut! Take it, and trouble me no more,' the king
rejoined. 'Will pay for twenty men do for him? Very well then. There,
M. de Marsac,' he continued, nodding at me and yawning, 'your request
is granted. You will find some other pretty baggages over there. Go
to them. And now, Rambouillet,' he went on, resuming his spirits as he
turned to matters of more importance, 'here is a new sweetmeat Zamet has
sent me. I have made Zizi sick with it. Will you try it? It is flavoured
with white mulberries.'

Thus dismissed, I fell back; and stood for a moment, at a loss whither
to turn, in the absence of either friends or acquaintances. His Majesty,
it is true, had bidden me go to certain pretty baggages, meaning,
apparently, five ladies who were seated at the farther end of the room,
diverting themselves with as many cavaliers; but the compactness of this
party, the beauty of the ladies, and the merry peals of laughter which
proceeded from them, telling of a wit and vivacity beyond the ordinary,
sapped the resolution which had borne me well hitherto. I felt that
to attack such a phalanx, even with a king's good will, was beyond the
daring of a Crillon, and I looked round to see whether I could not amuse
myself in some more modest fashion.

The material was not lacking. Crillon, still mouthing out his anger,
strode up and down in front of the trunk on which M. de Biron was
seated; but the latter was, or affected to be, asleep. 'Crillon is for
ever going into rages now,' a courtier beside me whispered.

'Yes,' his fellow answered, with a shrug of the shoulder; 'it is a pity
there is no one to tame him. But he has such a long reach, morbleu!'

'It is not that so much as the fellow's fury,' the first speaker
rejoined under his breath. 'He fights like a mad thing; fencing is no
use against him.'

The other nodded. For a moment the wild idea of winning renown by taming
M. de Crillon occurred to me as I stood alone in the middle of the
floor; but it had not more than passed through my brain when I felt
my elbow touched, and turned to find the young gentleman whom I had
encountered on the stairs standing by my side.

'Sir,' he lisped, in the same small voice, 'I think you trod on my toe a
while ago?'

I stared at him, wondering what he meant by this absurd repetition.
'Well, sir,' I answered drily, 'and if I did?'

'Perhaps,' he said, stroking his chin with his jewelled fingers,
'pending our meeting to-morrow, you would allow me to consider it as a
kind of introduction?'

'If it please you,' I answered, bowing stiffly, and wondering what he
would be at.

'Thank you,' he answered. 'It does please me, under the circumstances;
for there is a lady here who desires a word with you. I took up her
challenge. Will you follow me?'

He bowed, and turned in his languid fashion. I, turning too, saw, with
secret dismay, that the five ladies, referred to above, were all now
gazing at me, as expecting my approach; and this with such sportive
glances as told only too certainly of some plot already in progress or
some trick to be presently played me. Yet I could not see that I had any
choice save to obey, and, following my leader with as much dignity as I
could compass, I presently found myself bowing before the lady who sat
nearest, and who seemed to be the leader of these nymphs.

'Nay, sir,' she said, eyeing me curiously, yet with a merry face, 'I do
not need you; I do not look so high!'
