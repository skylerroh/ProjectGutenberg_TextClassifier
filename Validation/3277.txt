Her mother should see how little her work still lacked.

"If I had one hour more of daylight, I could finish it," she sighed.

Nika placed a large painting under the bright lamp. It somewhat
resembled the beautiful pictures which decorated the walls of the room.
The colors in it were perfectly wonderful, and Cornelli had never
before seen such a lovely picture. Sparkling crimson roses were hanging
down an old wall and dense ivy was creeping up between them with shiny
green leaves. An old oak tree was stretching large gnarled branches
over the decayed wall, and below, a clear stream was peacefully flowing
out to a meadow, where glowing red and blue flowers seemed to greet
it joyfully.

Cornelli stared at the lovely picture; she had never seen anything
like this glittering stream, the painted trees and flowers; one seemed
to hear the murmuring of the brook, far, far away through the meadow.
It was all so full of life! And to think that Nika had painted it!
Cornelli felt as if a deep, deep gulf lay between her and the two
sisters, a chasm that separated her from them forever.

The two sisters seemed to stand before her like two splendid creatures,
full of beauty and fine gifts, while she stood there a stupid, awkward,
block-headed Trina, whom nobody on earth ever could possibly love.
Mrs. Halm gave Nika great encouragement by praising her work and urging
her to begin promptly next day.

Then she sat down at the piano, for they always concluded their evening
with a song.

Cornelli remained still. The rector's wife urged her to join them, but
Cornelli had had too many impressions that day to be able to sing. She
knew quite well the old evening song that they were singing, for Martha
had taught it to her long ago, but she felt as if she could not utter
a note.

At the end of the song Agnes suddenly exploded: "Oh, mother, that is
nothing at all. When you are hoarse and Dino is in bed, our singing
is frightful. Nika only squeaks like a little chicken with a sore
throat."

"Well, then one has to stop singing," said Nika, shaking her shoulders
a little proudly.

"No, the whole household has to sing, otherwise it is not worth
anything," Agnes declared. "It is a shame that the most beautiful thing
in the world should be so little practiced."

After the song was ended the mother took Cornelli kindly by the hand
and said: "I am sure that you are tired, dear child. I am going to
take you to a tiny bedroom, for I have no larger one. Your door leads
into Agnes' and Nika's room," she continued, when she was standing
with Cornelli in the little chamber.

"You can open the door and then you are practically all three in a
single room."

Then she said good-night cordially and wished Cornelli a good rest.

Nika and Agnes quickly said good-night, too, and then Cornelli was
alone in her room.

She had no desire to open the door, for her shyness had only increased
since her arrival. How high the two stood above her! Cornelli was not
a bit sleepy and kept on thinking of all the things that had happened
to her that day.

What did Agnes mean when she spoke about the most beautiful thing in
the world? Did she mean singing? That was not the most beautiful thing
by any means. The most wonderful of all was a painting like Nika's,
with lovely roses and trees and the meadow with clear water. At last
Cornelli's eyes closed, but she kept on seeing the flowers and seemed
to be looking up admiringly at Nika, who stood beside her, tall and
beautiful. Cornelli thought: If she would only say one pleasant word
to me. Then Nika turned around to her and said: "You are an awkward,
block-headed Cornelli!" All this Cornelli saw and heard in her dream.

Agnes said to her sister in the other room: "If only Cornelli would
say something! One cannot tell what she is thinking about. How could
Dino find her so amusing, and become her friend? She sits there all
the time and never says a word."

"That is her least fault," Nika returned. "But it is horrid that she
insists on looking like a wild islander. I do not understand why Mama
did not push the frightful locks out of her eyes."




CHAPTER IX

A GREAT CHANGE



Next morning Mux had hardly opened his eyes when he desired to go again
straightway to Cornelli, for this had been promised him the night
before. Before he succeeded, however, he had to submit to his usual
fate in the morning. He ran into the room at last, neatly washed and
combed and with cheeks shining like two red apples. Cornelli was already
sitting in a corner of the room, listening attentively to Agnes'
playing. He flew towards her and saw his beloved book already in her
hands.

"Oh, now we shall read and tell stories all day long," he called out
happily. "All the others have to go to school."

But Mux had forgotten that breakfast came first of all. After the meal
the two sisters departed, but Dino knocked and clamored for Cornelli
to come to him. Mux loudly protested against this and only calmed down
when Cornelli promised to keep him company during Dino's rest hour.
He kept on objecting and murmuring to himself even after she had gone.

Cornelli was quite thrilled and overcome by the thought that anybody
should love her so, and it did her more good than anything else. As
soon as she came to Dino's room he asked her if she would read to him,
too, for he had found out how much she enjoyed reading to Mux out of
his picture book.

"Have you entertaining books, too?" asked Cornelli with hesitation.
In her mind she saw her own beautiful books at home, that she had left
alone because so many things in them had been unintelligible.

"I should say so! You just ought to see them," said Dino. "Please take
down the book called 'Funny Journeys.' There are pictures in it, too.
They are not as big as in the other book and are not colored, but they
are so comical that they make one laugh all the time."

Cornelli got the book down, and in a little while merry peals of
laughter filled the room. The mother, who heard, was happily smiling
and saying to herself: "No, no, all is not yet lost."

So the week passed by. Cornelli spent most of her time reading aloud
to Dino and to Mux. She grew more eager all the time in this occupation,
and if Mux would suddenly want to play with soldiers, Cornelli would
say: "You can easily play that alone. Let me read this and later I'll
tell you all about it." So she had soon finished reading the whole big
book.

Cornelli had so far scarcely become acquainted with the two girls, and
Nika had rarely spoken to her. On Saturday morning the mother entered
Dino's room just after Cornelli had finished reading such a funny tale
that both children still laughed aloud at the remembrance.

"Children, to-morrow Cornelli's father is expecting to hear from me.
He will want to know if he is to come to fetch her home, or if he is
to leave her here another week. Cornelli herself shall decide, but we
all want her to stay."

"Don't go, don't go! Tell him not to come for a long while," Mux
implored her. The little boy had slipped in behind his mother and was
keeping a tight hold on Cornelli, as if her papa might come at once
to pull her away.

"No, no, Cornelli, you won't go away yet," Dino now said. "To-morrow
I am allowed to get up for the first time and you must be there to see
if I can still walk. After that you must stay here till I go to school;
won't you, Cornelli? You don't want to go, do you?"

"You must not urge her too much," said the mother. "Maybe Cornelli
would rather go home, and by your talking you might keep her from
saying so." But being urged by the two children was such a joy to
Cornelli that she never even hesitated.

"I should love to stay," she said.

"Oh, how splendid!" Dino exclaimed. "Please ask for at least two or
three weeks, Mama. It is so nice to have Cornelli with us."

"I shall ask Cornelli's father to let us have his daughter a while
longer," said the mother, "I cannot possibly settle the time, her
father will do that."

"Oh, yes, a while longer is just right. Then it is so easy to ask for
a little more time, for we can say that we meant that by a little
longer," said Dino.

The same day, later on, while Dino was resting, Cornelli was sitting
with Mux. They were both so happy over the prospect of remaining
together that Mux opened the piano and asked Cornelli to sing with
him. Cornelli could not play, so promised that she would try to sing.
She asked Mux to choose a song, but he knew none.

"You sing one," he proposed, "and I might know it, too."

Cornelli was just in the mood to sing once more. She began a song with
her bright, full voice and Mux listened admiringly.

  The snow's on the meadow,
    The snow's all around,
  The snow lies in heaps
    All over the ground.
      Hurrah, oh hurrah!
    All over the ground.

  Oh cuckoo from the woods,
    Oh flowers so bright,
  Oh, kindliest sun,
    Come and bring us delight!
      Hurrah, oh hurrah!
    Come and bring us delight!

  When the swallow comes back
    And the finches all sing,
  I sing and I dance
    For joy of the Spring.
      Hurrah, oh hurrah!
  For joy of the Spring.

Suddenly the door flew open and Agnes burst into the room.

"But why didn't you ever say anything?" she cried out. "To think of
it! Why did you never say a word, Cornelli?"

"But what should I have said?" Cornelli asked, very much frightened.

"You must not be afraid," Mux now calmed her, "I'll help you, if she
should want to hurt you."

"Don't be so unnaturally stupid, Mux!" his sister ejaculated as she
ran to the next room. Here her mother was already standing in the open
door. "Have you heard it, Mother? Come out and let Cornelli sing her
song again!"

"Yes, indeed! I have heard it with pleasure and great wonder," said
the mother, approaching Cornelli. "You have a voice, dear child, that
we all should love to hear again. Have you often sung before?"

"Oh yes," said Cornelli. "Martha has taught me many songs, but--"

"What do you mean by but?" Agnes quickly interrupted her. "I know now
what a voice you have. I have to go quickly to my music lesson, but
you must sing a lot with me to-night. No buts will be allowed then."

"Oh, Cornelli, won't you sing with us tonight?" asked the mother kindly.
"We know now how well it sounds, and I do not see why you should still
hesitate."

"I can't sing properly when I am afraid, for then it does not sound
well," Cornelli replied.

"Why should you be afraid?" asked the mother. "You know us all so well
now."

"Oh, because I am not like Agnes and Nika. I can't do anything they
do and I don't look the way they do," said Cornelli. With these words
she frowned again in the old way, so that one could see it through the
thick fringes of hair that covered her forehead.

The mother said no more and went out.

"Just stay with me, Cornelli; then you don't have to be afraid of
anything," Mux said protectingly. "I am afraid of nothing in the whole
world--except of the dark," he added quickly, for he had seen Cornelli's
penetrating eyes looking at him through her hair, and felt that he had
to tell the truth, for she was sure to find him out. "No," he continued,
"I won't be even afraid of that if you stay with me all the time."

Agnes had finished her school work sooner than ever that day. She ran
to the piano and called to Cornelli: "Come here! Mux can play alone,
for we must sing now."

So Cornelli went up to the piano.

"I shall sing the first stanza of this song and then you can sing it
with me the second time," Agnes said and began: "The beauteous moon
is risen."

"Oh, I have known that song a long time. Shall I sing the second voice?"
asked Cornelli.

"What? Can you really sing second voice? Can you really do it? Oh,
that would be wonderful! Go ahead and do it!" said Agnes excitedly.

So the two girls sang alone together, for Nika had not finished her
work, and the regular time for the evening songs had not yet come.
Agnes was radiantly happy while she was making experiments with a new
voice.

Nika was still absorbed in her work, the mother only entered the room
now and then, and as Agnes was singing with her, Cornelli did not have
the feeling that anybody was listening. So she sang quite freely and
let her whole, full voice flow out. Agnes became more eager all the
time, and it really sounded as if a whole chorus were singing in the
room.

At last the mother stood still, and Nika, lifting her head from her
work, listened, too.

When the song was done, Agnes clapped her hands and said: "Oh, Cornelli,
your voice is as clear as a bell! Oh, if I only had a voice like that!
What wonderful things I could sing then! Do you know many songs,
Cornelli? Just tell me all you know."

Cornelli looked over the song book before her. She knew quite a number
of the songs in it, for Martha had taught her many.

Agnes was in raptures: "Oh, now our evening songs won't be like a
feeble chirping any more; now everything, everything will be different!"
she cried out. Suddenly struck with a new idea, she ran over to her
other music books.
