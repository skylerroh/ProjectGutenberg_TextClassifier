THE SHORT LIFE

_The Alien had to choose--and fast--a living entity to act through.
He chose ... but he made one error...._

An embryo stirred very slightly in the warm, dark womb that held it.
Chemical stimuli and minute pulses of energy that were forming the
complex proteins faltered. A catalyst failed briefly in its task, then
resumed, but the damage had been done. A vital circuit remained
incomplete, a neural path blocked. Time passed....

       *       *       *       *       *

An embryo gathered in a metal womb, controlled potential building to
titanic birth. A thread of wire melted under a breath of energy and
a tiny, glowing light winked out. A rodentlike maintenance robot,
scurrying to an unimportant repair task, saw no warning signal and
crossed a control panel from behind at the moment that a relay closed
automatically. Obliterated, the robot only briefly interfered with the
proper functioning of the machine, but the damage had been done. For
a split second at a critical moment, a mighty engine reacted out of
control. Time passed....

       *       *       *       *       *

An embryo jerked convulsively under a frightful onslaught, strained for
life in a crowded womb while the mother's convulsions threatened it with
death. The convulsions passed, the mother lived, the womb emptied, but
the damage had been done, a record had been cut. Time passed....

There are logical limits for any pretense--limits beyond which the
pretense becomes demonstrably absurd. Mother-love enabled the woman
Helen Douglas to evade logic up to and beyond the point of absurdity,
but even mother-love is not proof against the turmoil of the
subconscious. A survival factor pried up a safety valve, and Helen
Douglas found herself suddenly face to face with the admission that
she had so desperately suppressed. She reacted with a terrible storm
of weeping that shook the bed and was watched with complete disinterest
by the dry-eyed imbecile beside her. Two-year-old Timothy Wainwright
Douglas, congenital idiot, couldn't care less. It was nothing to him
that his mother had at last faced the ugly knowledge that her only child
should have been born dead. It was less than nothing to him that she
could almost find it in her heart to wish him dead.

       *       *       *       *       *

Release from the crowded womb brought no immediate awakening from the
long sleep of gestation, for a sense of identity comes only slowly to
the very young, the new-born. He did not realize that his intellectual
awakening, gradual as it seemed to him, was really extraordinarily
rapid, a matter of only two or three weeks after birth. To him, with no
frame of reference, it was a time of mystery that was not recognized as
mystery. At first there was only Warmth and Hunger, for which he had no
names but which he recognized by their presence or absence. There was
the satisfying of Hunger, Sleep, and the return of Hunger. Had he been
inclined to philosophy at that tender age, he would have considered the
cycle a complete and satisfying one. In a few days, however, there were
longer periods between the satisfying of Hunger and the coming of
Sleep--a sort of comfortable, full-stomached reverie that was the
beginning of the end.

With astounding precocity of which he was completely unaware, he began
rapidly sorting and cataloguing noises that had previously conveyed no
meaning. He now learned to associate certain sounds with certain sources
and place others under tentative listings while awaiting further data.
Smells received the same treatment as noises and often the two could be
related. A certain smell and a certain gobbling sort of noise were often
followed by a frightening swoop as he was lifted, but his eyes were not
yet focused and could give him little information as to the manner or
purpose of lifting.

In his fourth week of life he began to be troubled. His little handful
of memories centered around a growing and not entirely subjective
awareness of himself as an individual. Clearly, life could be divided
into "me" and "not me." To have arrived at that conclusion twenty-odd
days after birth was an incredible achievement. His mind was quick,
but it could not reason further without a basis for logic, a system
of reference, learned data from which further data could be inferred.
There was uneasiness in him, but no warning of danger; only a stirring
of memory that tried to rise to the conscious level. Wonderingly he
prodded the memory a little, as an inquisitive child pokes at a
slow-burning firecracker or a wary pup approaches its first cat. Like
the sharp crack of a squib, the quick spit of a cat, the memory erupted
and flung him back on his mental heels.

He felt a sensation that he knew was death though he had no name for
it, and his immature defenses sprang into action, tried in vain to block
the memory, to thrust Death back into its Pandora's Box. He impeded the
flood by an infinitesimal fraction of a second, and then full awareness
came and with it an understanding of the terrible thing that had
happened, the thing that he?--yes, _he_ had done.

The fledgling identity of "me" and "not me" sank forever into
submergence, never to rise again.

When he was almost four, Timmy spoke his first words. He said clearly
and matter-of-factly, "I want that one, Helen."

His mother's mouth slowly opened while her face turned gray with shock.
The buckling of her knees in cataplexy forced her to sit down heavily
on a kitchen chair not cushioned for such descents, but she was hardly
aware of it. Timmy, seated on the kitchen floor and surrounded by
half-grown pups owned by a neighbor, screwed his head around to glance
at her impatiently over his shoulder.

"I want that one," he repeated confidently, and pointed to the most
ill-proportioned of an ill-conceived litter of mongrels. Helen raised
shaking hands to her face, and screamed.

The quick scrape of a chair in the living room and the sound of hasty
footsteps glissading on the throw-rug in the hall heralded the approach
of Timmy's father. The doorway filled with flexing muscles that flexed
in vain, but somewhat at a disadvantage by the strictly static tableaux.
Helen sat at the table, her staring eyes fixed on the child who looked
back in blank astonishment. Even the pups were motionless, having
cowered in alarm at Helen's scream.

"What's the matter?" Timmy's father asked.

His voice was a spur rudely galvanizing her into action, into an awkward
convulsion that landed her on her knees beside Timmy. She gripped his
little shoulders with fierce intensity and almost glared into his eyes.

"Say it again, Timmy--_say it again_!" She looked around wildly.
"He spoke, Jerry, as clear as anyone! He said 'I want that one,' and
pointed! Timmy ... darling ... _angel_ ... say it again!"

Timmy's face twitched uncertainly, giving the effect of a confused play
of expressions. For a moment he looked as though he would cry, but then
the crumpled, puckered lines magically smoothed. The eyes, dull and
blank, stayed dry. He made a senseless noise and slobbered in doing so.
His jaw was slack, his chin wet.

Jerry felt slightly sick.

"Get up, Helen." He lifted her somewhat roughly to her feet, overrode
her babble. "You're frightening the ... the child."

"He _talked_, Jerry ... you heard him! _Didn't_ you hear him!"

"Come in the living room and sit down." She was half-carried, her
protests ignored. There was a certain grim determination in his actions
as he made her comfortable. "Now we're going to face it, Helen. It can't
be put off. Timmy was heart-wrenching enough by himself, but I've had to
watch the change in you in the past few months. You're getting ... well,
we'll call it hysterical. I could cut off my arm for saying this, honey,
but, if we keep Timmy any longer, you'll just have a breakdown, that's
all!"

She moaned softly, rocking back and forth in misery's timeless attitude.
"I can't help it, Jerry. I ... just ... can't ... help it."

"I know, I know. So I'm making the decision for both of us, here and
now, and on my head be it. Timmy will have to be put away this week,
permanently."

"No!" Her wail was more of anguish than of protest.

"Yes! I can't stand coming home from work day after day to find you've
manufactured some new evidence to delude yourself there's hope for him.
One day he took the spoon in his hand to feed himself, another day he
focused his eyes and looked around the room as though he was really
taking everything in--"

"You said you believed me!"

"So I did--at first. So I'd sit around all evening watching him,
_willing_ him to do something intelligent. And did he? No. Hon, I don't
want to be unkind to you or to him, but I can't stand seeing you delude
yourself, making yourself sick. We've both taken more than is good for
us. We're at the end of our rope. We've got to face it now and do what
should have been done long ago. It's not as if Timmy will miss us. He
doesn't even know us, after four years!"

She gathered her forces, shut her eyes tight as if to deny his
existence. "It's no use, Jerry, I won't do it. I am _not_ deluding
myself. I heard him speak. If that was illusion, it was so real to me
that you may as well put us both away together!"

"Hysterical hallucinations--"

"Jerry, don't say that again. _I heard him say 'I want that one,
Helen!_'"

"You see! Already you're embroidering what you heard! Now he's
calling his mother by her first name. Honest, Helen, can't you see how
ridiculous you're being? If you'd thought he said da-da or goo-goo
I could have gone along with the gag, but to have him jump the whole
learning stage and come out with a complete, concise, explicit little
sentence ending familiarly with your Christian name--"

"I don't know how he did it, but he _did_ it."

Jerry rose from his seat beside her, his lips tight. "I can't honestly
say I love my own child, hard as I've tried. But I can say that I love
his mother. If I have to bankrupt myself to give Timmy proper care in
an institution, then I'll do just that, and do it gladly. But I won't
falsely place his interests above yours. He was born an idiot and he
will live and die an idiot. Nothing can change that. Timmy goes, and
that's final."

He clamped his mouth shut and turned toward the kitchen where he knew
his son sat, a stupid lump that couldn't even crawl of its own volition.
The stupid lump stood firmly in the doorway, an uncertain, placating
smile on its lips, a pup cradled in the slender arms.

"Jerry? I want _this_ one."




IV


By Timmy's sixth birthday, only his parents' adamant attitude had
saved him from becoming a side show. Once the initial household uproar
had died down and some degree of general sanity been restored, Helen
and Jerry had another bad fright. They had grudgingly allowed Clancey,
the family sawbones, to call in a psychologist friend, Philip Warwick.
The combined efforts of these two to find an explanation for Timmy
resulted in complete chaos, with Timmy suffering violent and erratic
lapses into complete idiocy for varying lengths of time. Standard tests
meant nothing, unless mutually exclusive results could be accepted as
meaningful in themselves. At length, Timmy suffered a relapse of such
duration that the parents became panic-stricken and quietly rebelled.
It was obvious that he needed an atmosphere of peace and quiet.
Confusion, excitement, or the concentrated attention of several adults
simply threw him into a relapse.
