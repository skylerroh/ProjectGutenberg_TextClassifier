whom my lady inquired after under the title of the Savage; and was
informed by her niece that he was still in bed, repairing the fatigue of
last night's debauch, and recruiting strength and spirits to undergo a
fox chase to-morrow morning, in company with Sir Timothy Thicket, Squire
Bumper, and a great many other gentlemen of the same stamp, whom he had
invited on that occasion! so that by daybreak the whole house would
be in an uproar. This was a very disagreeable piece of news to the
virtuoso, who protested she would stuff her ears with cotton when she
went to bed, and take a dose of opium to make her sleep the more sound,
that she might not be disturbed and distracted by the clamour of the
brutes.

When their dinner was over, I and my fellow servants sat down to ours in
the kitchen, where I understood that Sir Timothy Thicket was a wealthy
knight in the neighbourhood, between whom and Narcissa a match had been
projected by her brother, who promised at the same time to espouse Sir
Timothy's sister; by which means, as their fortunes were pretty equal,
the young ladies would be provided for, and their brothers be never the
poorer; but that the ladies did not concur in the scheme, each of them
entertaining a hearty contempt for the person allotted to her for
a husband by this agreement. This information begat in me a mortal
aversion to Sir Timothy, whom I looked upon as my rival, and cursed in
my heart for his presumption.

Next morning, by daybreak, being awakened by the noise of the hunters
and hounds, I rose to view the cavalcade, and had a sight of my
competitor, whose accomplishments (the estate excluded) did not seem
brilliant enough to give me much uneasiness with respect to Narcissa,
who, I flattered myself, was not to be won by such qualifications as he
was master of, either as to person or mind. My mistress, notwithstanding
her precaution, was so much disturbed by her nephew's company, that
she did not rise till five o'clock in the afternoon; so that I had an
opportunity of examining her study at leisure, to which examination I
was strongly prompted by my curiosity. Here I found a thousand scraps
of her own poetry, consisting of three, four, ten, twelve, and twenty
lines, on an infinity of subjects, which, as whim inspired, she
had begun, without constancy or capacity to bring to any degree of
composition: but, what was very extraordinary in a female poet, there
was not the least mention made of love in any of her performances. I
counted fragments of five tragedies, the titles of which were "The Stern
Philosopher," "The Double," "The Sacrilegious Traitor," "The Fall
of Lucifer," and "The Last Day." From whence I gathered, that her
disposition was gloomy, and her imagination delighted with objects of
horror. Her library was composed of the best English historians, poets,
and philosophers; of all the French critics and poets, and of a few
books in Italian, chiefly poetry, at the head of which were Tasso and
Ariosto, pretty much used. Besides these, translations of the classics
into French, but not one book in Greek or Latin; a circumstance that
discovered her ignorance in these languages.

After having taken a full view of this collection, I retired, and at the
usual time was preparing to lay the cloth, when I was told by the maid
that her mistress was still in bed, and had been so affected with the
notes of the hounds in the morning, that she actually believed herself
a hare beset by the hunters, and begged a few greens to munch
for breakfast. When I expressed my surprise in this unaccountable
imagination she gave me to understand that her lady was very much
subject to whims of this nature; sometimes fancying herself an animal,
sometimes a piece of furniture, during which conceited transformations
it was very dangerous to come near her, especially when she represented
a beast; for that lately, in the character of a cat, she had flown at
her, and scratched her face in a terrible manner: that some months ago,
she prophesied the general conflagration was at hand, and nothing would
be able to quench it but her water, which therefore she kept so long,
that her life was in danger, and she must needs have died of the
retention, had they not found an expedient to make her evacuate, by
kindling a bonfire under her chamber window and persuading her that the
house was in flames: upon which, with great deliberation, she bade them
bring all the tubs and vessels they could find to be filled for the
preservation of the house, into one of which she immediately discharged
the cause of her distemper. I was also informed that nothing contributed
so much to the recovery of her reason as music, which was always
administered on those occasions by Narcissa, who played perfectly well
on the harpsichord, and to whom she (the maid) was just then going to
intimate her aunt's disorder.

She was no sooner gone than I was summoned by the bell to my lady's
chamber, where I found her sitting squat on her hands on the floor, in
the manner of puss when she listens to the outcries of her pursuers.
When I appeared, she started up with an alarmed look, and sprang to the
other side of the room to avoid me, whom, without doubt, she mistook for
a beagle thirsting after her life. Perceiving her extreme confusion, I
retired, and on the staircase met the adorable Narcissa coming up, to
whom I imparted the situation of my mistress; she said not a word, but
smiling with unspeakable grace, went into her aunt's apartment, and in
a little time my ears were ravished with the efforts of her skill. She
accompanied the instrument with a voice so sweet and melodious, that I
did not wonder at the surprising change it produced on the spirits of my
mistress which composed to peace and sober reflection.

About seven o'clock, the hunters arrived with the skins of two foxes and
one badger, carried before them as trophies of their success; and when
they were about to sit down to dinner (or supper) Sir Timothy Thicket
desired that Narcissa would honour the table with her presence; but
this request, notwithstanding her brother's threats and entreaties, she
refused, on pretence of attending her aunt, who was indisposed; so
I enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing my rival mortified: but this
disappointment made no great impression on him, who consoled himself
with the bottle, of which the whole company became so enamoured that,
after a most horrid uproar of laughing, singing, swearing, and fighting,
they were all carried to bed in a state of utter oblivion. My duty being
altogether detached from the squire and his family, I led a pretty easy
and comfortable life, drinking daily intoxicating draughts of love from
the charms of Narcissa, which brightened on my contemplation every day
more and more. Inglorious as my station was, I became blind to my own
unworthiness, and even conceived hopes of one day enjoying this amiable
creature, whose, affability greatly encouraged these presumptuous
thoughts.






CHAPTER XL

My mistress is surprised at my learning--communicates her performances
to me--I impart some of mine to her--am mortified at her faint
praise--Narcissa approves of my conduct--I gain an involuntary
conquest over the cookwench and dairymaid--their mutual resentment and
insinuations--the jealousy of their lovers

During this season of love and tranquillity, my muse, which had lain
dormant so long, awoke, and produced several small performances on
the subject of my flame. But as it concerned me nearly to remain
undiscovered in my character and sentiments, I was under a necessity of
mortifying my desire of praise, by confining my works to my own perusal
and applause. In the meantime I strove to insinuate myself into the
good opinion of both ladies; and succeeded so well, by my diligence
and dutiful behaviour, that in a little time I was at least a favourite
servant; and frequently enjoyed the satisfaction of hearing myself
mentioned in French and Italian, with some degree of warmth and surprise
by the dear object of all my wishes, as a person who had so much of the
gentleman in my appearance and discourse, that she could not for her
soul treat me like a common lacquey. My prudence and modesty were not
long proof against these bewitching compliments. One day, while I waited
at dinner, the conversation turned upon a knotty passage of Tasso's
Gierusalem, which, it seems, had puzzled them both: after a great many
unsatisfactory conjectures, my mistress, taking the book out of her
pocket, turned up the place in question, and read the sentence over
and over without success; at length, despairing of finding the author's
meaning, she turned to me, saying, "Come hither, Bruno; let us see what
fortune will do for us: I will interpret to thee what goes before, and
what follows this obscure paragraph, the particular words of which I
will also explain, that thou mayst, by comparing one with another, guess
the sense of that which perplexes us." I was too vain to let slip this
opportunity of displaying my talents; therefore, without hesitation,
read and explained the whole of that which had disconcerted them, to
the utter astonishment of both. Narcissa's face and lovely neck were
overspread with blushes, from which I drew a favourable opinion,
while her aunt, after having stared at me a good while with a look of
amazement, exclaimed, "In the name of heaven who art thou?" I told her
I had picked up a smattering of Italian, during a voyage up the Straits.
At this explanation she shook her head, and observed that no smatterer
could read as I had done. She then desired to know if I understood
French. To which question I answered in the affirmative. She asked if I
was acquainted with the Latin and Greek? I replied, "A little." "Oho!"
continued she, "and with philosophy and mathematics, I suppose?" I owned
I knew something of each. Then she repeated her stare and interrogation.
I began to repent of my vanity, and in order to repair the fault I
committed, said, it was not to be wondered at if I had a tolerable
education, for learning was so cheap in my country, that every peasant
was a scholar; but, I hoped her Ladyship would think my understanding no
exception to my character. "No, no, God forbid." But during the rest of
the time they sat at table, they behaved with remarkable reserve.

This alteration gave me great uneasiness; and I passed the night without
sleep, in melancholy reflections on the vanity of young men, which
prompts them to commit so many foolish actions, contrary to their
own sober judgment. Next day, however, instead of profiting by this
self-condemnation, I yielded still more to the dictates of the principle
I had endeavoured to chastise, and if fortune had not befriended me more
than prudence could expect, I should have been treated with the contempt
it deserved. After breakfast my lady, who was a true author, bade me
follow her into the study, where she expressed herself thus: "Since you
are so learned, you cannot be void of taste; therefore I am to desire
your opinion of a small performance in poetry, which I lately composed.
You must know that I have planned a tragedy, the subject of which shall
be, the murder of a prince before the altar, where he is busy at his
devotions. After the deed is perpetrated, the regicide will harangue the
people with the bloody dagger in his hand; and I have already composed a
speech, which, I think, will suit the character extremely. Here it is."
Then, taking up a scrap of paper, she read, with violent emphasis and
gesture, as follows:--


"Thus have I sent the simple King to hell, Without or coffin, shroud, or
passing bell: To me what are divine and human laws? I court no sanction
but my own applause! Rapes, robberies, treasons, yield my soul delight,
And human carnage gratifies my sight: I drag the parent by the hoary
hair, And toss the sprawling infant on the spear, While the fond
mother's cries regale my ear. I fight, I vanquish, murder friends and
foes; Nor dare the immortal gods my rage oppose."

Though I did great violence to my understanding in praising this
unnatural rhapsody, I nevertheless extolled it as a production that of
itself deserved immortal fame; and besought her ladyship to bless the
world with the fruits of those uncommon talents Heaven had bestowed upon
her. She smiled with a look of self-complacency, and encouraged by
the incense I had offered, communicated all her poetical works which I
applauded, one by one, with as little candour as I had shown at first.
Satiated with my flattery, which I hope my situation justified, she
could not in conscience refuse me an opportunity of shining in my turn:
and, therefore, after a compliment to my nice discernment and taste,
observed, that doubtless I must have produced something in that way
myself, which she desired to see. This was temptation I could by no
means resist. I owned that while I was at college I wrote some detached
pieces, at the desire of a friend who was in love; and at her request
repeated the following verses, which indeed my love for Narcissa had
inspired:--


On Celia,

Playing on the harpsichord and singing.

When Sappho struck the quivering wire, The throbbing breast was all on
fire: And when she raised the vocal lay, The captive soul was charm'd
away.

But had the nymph possessed with these Thy softer, chaster, power to
please; Thy beauteous air of sprightly youth, Thy native smiles of
artless truth;

The worm of grief had never preyed On the forsaken love-sick maid: Nor
had she mourn'd a hapless flame, Nor dash'd on rocks her tender frame.

My mistress paid me a cold compliment on the versification, which, she
said, was elegant enough, but, the subject beneath the pen of a true
poet. I was extremely nettled at her indifference, and looked at
Narcissa, who by this time had joined us, for her approbation; but
she declined giving her opinion, protesting she was no judge of
these matters; so that I was forced to retire very much balked in
my expectation, which was generally a little too sanguine. In the
afternoon, however, the waiting-maid assured me that Narcissa had
expressed her approbation of my performance with great warmth, and
desired her to procure a copy of it as for herself, that she (Narcissa)
might have an opportunity to peruse it at pleasure. I was elated to an
extravagant pitch at this intelligence, and immediately transcribed a
fair copy of my Ode, which was carried to the dear charmer, together
with another on the same subject, as follows:--


Thy fatal shaft unerring move; I bow before thine altar, Love! I feel
thou soft resistless flame Glide swift through all my vital frame!

For while I gaze my bosom glows, My blood in tides impetuous flows;
Hope, fear, and joy alternate roll, And floods of transports 'whelm my
soul!

My faltering tongue attempts in vain In soothing murmurs to complain; My
tongue some secret magic ties, My murmurs sink in broken sighs.

Condemn'd to nurse eternal care, And ever drop the silent tear, Unheard
I mourn, unknown I sigh, Unfriended live, unpitied die!

Whether or not Narcissa discovered my passion, I could not learn from
her behaviour, which, though always benevolent to me was henceforth more
reserved and less cheerful. While my thoughts aspired to a sphere so
far above me, I had unwittingly made a conquest of the cookwench and
dairymaid, who became so jealous of each other that, if their sentiments
had been refined by education, it is probable one or other of them would
have had recourse to poison or steel to be avenged of her rival; but, as
their minds were happily adapted to their humble station, their mutual
enmity was confined to scolding and fistcuffs, in which exercise they
were both well skilled. My good fortune did not long remain a secret;
for it was disclosed by the frequent broils of these heroines, who kept
no decorum in their encounters. The coachman and gardener, who paid
their devoirs to my admirers, each to his respective choice, alarmed
at my success, laid their heads together, in order to concert a plan
of revenge; and the former, having been educated at the academy
at Tottenham Court, undertook to challenge me to single combat. He
accordingly, with many opprobrious invectives, bade me defiance, and
offered to box me for twenty guineas. I told him that, although I
believed myself a match for him even at that work I would not descend so
far below the dignity of a gentleman as to fight like a porter; but
if he had anything to say to me, I was his man at blunderbuss, musket,
pistol, sword, hatchet, spit, cleaver, fork, or needle; nay, I swore,
that should he give his tongue any more saucy liberties at my expense,
I would crop his ears without any ceremony. This rhodomontade, delivered
with a stern countenance and resolute tone, had the desired effect
upon my antagonist, who, with some confusion, sneaked off, and gave his
friend an account of his reception.

The story, taking air among the servants, procured for me the title of
Gentleman John, with which I was sometimes honoured, even by my
mistress and Narcissa, who had been informed of the whole affair by the
chambermaid. In the meantime, the rival queens expressed their passion
by all the ways in their power: the cook entertained me with choice
bits, the dairymaid with strokings: the first would often encourage me
to declare myself, by complimenting me upon my courage and learning, and
observing, that if she had a husband like me, to maintain order and
keep accounts, she could make a great deal of money, by setting up an
eating-house in London for gentlemen's servants on board wages. The
other courted my affection by showing her own importance, and telling
me that many a substantial farmer in the neighbourhood would be glad to
marry her, but she was resolved to please her eye, if she should plague
her heart. Then she would launch out into the praise of my proper
person, and say, she was sure I would make a good husband, for I was
very good-natured. I began to be uneasy at the importunities of these
inamoratas, whom, at another time perhaps, I might have pleased without
the disagreeable sauce of matrimony, but, at present, my whole soul
was engrossed by Narcissa; and I could not bear the thoughts of doing
anything derogatory to the passion I entertained for her.






CHAPTER XLI

Narcissa being in danger from the brutality of Sir Timothy, is rescued
by me, who revenge myself on my rival--I declare my passion, and
retreat to the seaside--am surrounded by smugglers, and carried to
Boulogne--find my Uncle Lieutenant Bowling in great distress, and
relieve him--our conversation

At certain intervals my ambition would revive; I would despise myself
for my tame resignation to my sordid fate, and revolve a hundred schemes
for assuming the character of a gentleman, to which I thought myself
entitled by birth and education. In these fruitless suggestions time
stole away unperceived, and I had already remained eight months in the
station of a footman, when an accident happened that put an end to my
servitude, and, for the present, banished all hopes of succeeding in my
love.

Narcissa went one day to visit Miss Thicket, who lived with her brother
within less than a mile of our house, and was persuaded to walk home in
the cool of the evening, accompanied by Sir Timothy, who, having a
good deal of the brute in him, was instigated to use some unbecoming
familiarities with her, encouraged by the solitariness of a field
through which they passed. The lovely creature was incensed at his rude
behaviour for which she reproached him in such a manner that he lost
all regard to decency, and actually offered violence to this pattern of
innocence and beauty. But Heaven would not suffer so much goodness to
be violated, and sent me, who, passing by accident near the place, was
alarmed with her cries, for her succour. What were the emotions of my
soul, when I beheld Narcissa almost sinking beneath the brutal force of
this satyr! I flew like lightning to her rescue, and he, perceiving me,
quitted his prey, and drew his hanger to chastise my presumption. My
indignation was too high to admit one thought of fear, so that, rushing
upon him, I struck his weapon out of his hand, and used my cudgel so
successfully that he fell to the ground, and lay, to all appearance,
without sense. Then I turned to Narcissa, who had swooned, and sitting
down by her, gently raised her head, and supported it on my bosom,
while, with my hand around her waist, I kept her in that position.
My soul was thrilled with tumultuous joy, at feeling the object of my
dearest wishes within my arms; and, while she lay insensible, I could
not refrain from applying my cheeks to hers, and ravishing a kiss. In
a little time the blood began to revisit her face, she opened her
enchanting eyes, and, having recollected her late situation, said, with
a look full of tender acknowledgment, "Dear John, I am eternally obliged
to you!" So saying she made an effort to rise, in which I assisted her,
and she proceeded to the house, leaning upon me all the way. I was a
thousand times tempted by this opportunity to declare my passion, but
the dread of disobliging her restrained my tongue. We had not moved
a hundred paces from the scene of her distress, when I perceived Sir
Timothy rise and walk homeward--a circumstance which, though it gave
me some satisfaction, inasmuch as I thereby knew I had not killed him,
filled me with just apprehension of his resentment, which I found myself
in no condition to withstand; especially when I considered his intimacy
with our squire, to whom I knew he could justify himself for what he had
done, by imputing it to his love, and desiring his brother Bruin to take
the same liberty with his sister, without any fear of offence.

When we arrived at the house, Narcissa assured me she would exert all
her influence in protecting me from the revenge of Thicket, and likewise
engage her aunt in my favour. At the same time, pulling out her purse,
offered it as a small consideration for the service I had done her.
But I stood too much upon the punctilios of love to incur the least
suspicion of being mercenary, and refused the present, by saying I had
merited nothing by barely doing my duty. She seemed astonished at my
disinterestedness, and blushed: I felt the same suffusion, and, with
a downcast eye and broken accent, told her I had one request to make,
which, if her generosity would grant, I should think myself fully
recompensed, for an age of misery. She changed colour at this preamble,
and, with great confusion, replied, she hoped my good sense would hinder
me from asking anything she was bound in honour to refuse, and therefore
bade me signify my desire. Upon which I kneeled, and engaged to kiss
her hand. She immediately, with an averted look, stretched it out: I
imprinted on it an ardent kiss, and, bathing it with my tears, cried,
"Dear Madam, I am an unfortunate gentleman, and love you to distraction,
but would have died a thousand deaths rather than make this declaration
under such a servile appearance, were I not determined to yield to the
rigour of my fate, to fly from your bewitching presence, and bury my
presumptuous passion in eternal silence." With these words I rose, and
went away before she could recover her spirits so far as to make any
reply.

My first care was to go and consult Mrs. Sagely, with whom I had
entertained a friendly correspondence ever since I left her house. When
she understood my situation, the good woman, with real concern, condoled
with me on my unhappy fate, and approved of my resolution to leave
the country, as being perfectly well acquainted with the barbarous
disposition of my rival, "who, by this time," said she, "has no doubt
meditated a scheme of revenge. Indeed, I cannot see how you will be
able to elude his vengeance; being himself in the commission, he will
immediately grant warrants for apprehending you; and, as almost all the
people in this country are dependent on him or his friend, it will
be impossible for you to find shelter among them. If you should be
apprehended, he will commit you to jail, where you may possibly in
great misery languish till the next assizes, and then be transported for
assaulting a magistrate."

While she thus warned me of my danger, we heard a knocking at the door,
which threw us both into great consternation, as in all probability, it
was occasioned by my pursuers; whereupon this generous old lady, putting
two guineas into my hand, with tears in her eyes, bade me, for God's
sake, get out at the back-door and consult my safety as Providence
should direct me. There was no time for deliberation. I followed her
advice, and escaped by the benefit of a dark night to the seaside,
where, while I ruminated on my next excursion, I was all of a sudden
surrounded by armed men, who, having bound my hands and feet, bade
me make no noise on pain of being shot, and carried me on board of a
vessel, which I soon perceived to be a smuggling cutter. This discovery
gave me some satisfaction at first, because I concluded myself safe from
the resentment of Sir Timothy; but, when I found myself in the hands of
ruffians, who threatened to execute me for a spy, I would have thought
myself happily quit for a year's imprisonment, or even transportation.
It was in vain for me to protest my innocence: I could not persuade them
that I had taken a solitary walk to their haunt, at such an hour, merely
for my own amusement; and I did not think it my interest to disclose
the true cause of my retreat, because I was afraid they would have made
their peace with justice by surrendering me to the penalty of the law.
What confirmed their suspicion was, the appearance of a custom-house
yacht, which gave them chase, and had well nigh made a prize of their
vessel; when they were delivered from their fears by a thick fog, which
effectually screened them, and favoured their arrival at Boulogne. But,
before they got out of sight of their pursuer, they held a council
of war about me, and some of the most ferocious among them would have
thrown me overboard as a traitor who had betrayed them to their enemies;
but others, more considerate, alleged, that if they put me to death,
and should afterwards be taken, they could expect no mercy from the
legislature, which would never pardon outlawry aggravated by murder. It
was therefore determined by a plurality of votes, that I should be set
on shore in France, and left to find my way back to England, as I should
think proper, this being punishment sufficient for the bare suspicion of
a crime in itself not capital.

Although this favourable determination gave me great pleasure, the
apprehension of being robbed would not suffer me to be perfectly at
ease. To prevent this calamity, as soon as I was untied, in consequence
of the aforesaid decision, I tore a small hole in one of my stockings,
into which I dropped six guineas, reserving half a piece and some silver
in my pocket, that, finding something, they might not be tempted to make
any further inquiry. This was a very necessary precaution, for, when we
came within sight of the French shore, one of the smugglers told me, I
must pay for my passage. To this declaration I replied, that my passage
was none of my own seeking; therefore they could not expect a reward
from me for transporting me into a strange country by force. "D-me!"
said the outlaw, "none of your palaver; but let me see what money you
have got." So saying, he thrust his hand into my pocket without any
ceremony, and emptied it of the contents; then, casting an eye at my hat
and wig, which captivated his fancy, he took them off, clapping his own
on my head, declared, that a fair exchange was no robbery. I was fain to
put up with this bargain, which was by no means favourable to me; and a
little while after we went all on shore together.

I resolved to take my leave of those desperadoes without much ceremony,
when one of them cautioned me against appearing to their prejudice if
ever I returned to England, unless I had a mind to be murdered; for
which service, he assured me, the gang never wanted agents. I promised
to observe his advice, and departed for the Upper Town, where I inquired
for a cabaret, or public-house, into which I went, with an intention
of taking some refreshment. In the kitchen, five Dutch sailors sat at
breakfast with a large loaf, a firkin of butter, and a keg of brandy,
the bung of which they often applied to their mouths with great
perseverance and satisfaction. At some distance from them I perceived
another person in the same garb, sitting in a pensive solitary manner,
entertaining himself with a whiff of tobacco, from the stump of a pipe
as black as jet. The appearance of distress never failed to attract
my regard and compassion. I approached this forlorn tar with a view to
offer him my assistance, and, notwithstanding the alteration of dress
and disguise of a long beard, I discovered in him my long lost and
lamented uncle and benefactor, Lieutenant Bowling! Good Heaven! what
were the agitations of my soul, between the joy of finding again such a
valuable friend, and the sorrow of seeing him in such a low condition!
The tears gushed down my cheeks; I stood motionless and silent for some
time. At length, recovering the use of speech, I exclaimed, "Gracious
God! Mr. Bowling!" My uncle no sooner heard his name mentioned, than
he started up, crying, with some surprise, "Holla!" and, after having
looked at me steadfastly, without being able to recollect me, said,
"Did you call me, brother," I told him I had something extraordinary to
communicate, and desired him to give me the hearing for a few minutes in
another room; but he would by no means consent to this proposal, saying,
"Avast there, friend: none of your tricks upon travellers;--if you have
anything to say to me, do it above board;--you need not be afraid of
being overheard;--here are none who understand our lingo." Though I was
loth to discover myself before company, I could no longer refrain from
telling him I was his own nephew, Roderick Random. On this information,
he considered me with great earnestness and astonishment, and, recalling
my features, which, though enlarged, were not entirely altered since
he had seen me, came up, and shook me by the hand very cordially,
protesting he was glad to see me well. After some pause, he went on
thus; "And yet, my lad, I am sorry to see you under such colours; the
more so, as it is not in my power, at present, to change them for
the better, times being very hard with me," With these words I could
perceive a tear trickle down his furrowed cheek, which affected me so
munch that I wept bitterly.

Imagining my sorrow was the effect of my own misfortunes, he comforted
me with observing, that life was a voyage in which we must expect to
meet with all weathers; sometimes was calm, sometimes rough; that a fair
gale often succeeded a storm; that the wind did not always sit one
way, and that despair signified nothing; that resolution and skill were
better than a stout vessel: for why? because they require no carpenter,
and grow stronger the more labour they undergo. I dried up my tears,
which I assured him were not shed for my own distress, but for his, and
begged leave to accompany him into another room, where we could converse
more at our ease. There I recounted to him the ungenerous usage I had
met with from Potion; at which relation he started up, stalked across
the room three or four times in a great hurry, and, grasping his cudgel,
cried, "I would I were alongside of him--that's all--I would I were
alongside of him!" I then gave him a detail of my adventures and
sufferings, which affected him more than I could have imagined; and
concluded with telling him that Captain Oakun was still alive, and that
he might return to England when he would to solicit his affairs, without
danger or molestation. He was wonderfully pleased with this piece of
information, of which, however, he said he could not at present avail
himself, for want of money to pay for his passage to London. This
objection I soon removed, by putting five guineas into his hand, and
telling him I thought myself extremely happy in having an opportunity
of manifesting my gratitude to him in his necessity. But it was with the
utmost difficulty I could prevail upon him to accept of two, which he
affirmed were more than sufficient to defray the necessary expense.

After this friendly contest was over, he proposed we should have a mess
of something; "For," said he, "it has been banyan day with me a great
while. You must know I was shipwrecked, five days ago, near a place
called Lisieux, in company with those Dutchmen who are now drinking
below; and having but little money when I came ashore, it was soon
spent, because I let them have share and share while it lasted.
Howsomever, I should have remembered the old saying, every hog his own
apple; for when they found my hold unstowed, they went all hands to
shooling and begging; and, because I would not take a spell at the same
duty, refused to give me the least assistance; so that I have not broke
bread these two days." I was shocked at the extremity of his distress,
and ordered some bread, cheese, and wine, to be brought immediately, to
allay his hunger, until a fricassee of chickens could be prepared. When
he had recruited his spirits with this homely fare, I desired to
know the particulars of his peregrination since the accident at Cape
Tiberoon, which were briefly these: The money he had about him being all
spent at Port Louis, the civility and hospitality of the French cooled
to such a degree, that he was obliged to list on board one of their
king's ships as a common foremast man, to prevent himself from starving
on shore. In this situation he continued two years, during which time he
had acquired some knowledge of their language, and the reputation of a
good seaman; the ship he belonged to was ordered home to France, where
she was laid up as unfit for service, and he was received on board
one of Monsieur D'Antin's squadron, in quality of quartermaster; which
office he performed in a voyage to the West Indies, where he engaged
with our ship, as before related; but his conscience upbraiding him for
serving the one enemies of his country, he quitted the ship at the same
place where he first listed, and got to Curacoa in a Dutch vessel; there
he bargained with a skipper, bound to Europe, to work for his passage
to Holland, from whence he was in hopes of hearing from his friends in
England; but was cast away, as he mentioned before, on the French coast,
and must have been reduced to the necessity of travelling on foot to
Holland, and begging for his subsistence on the road, or of entering on
board of another French man-of-war, at the hazard of being treated as
a deserter, if Providence had not sent me to his succour. "And now, my
lad," continued he, "I think I shall steer my course directly to London,
where I do not doubt of being replaced, and of having the R taken off
me by the Lords of the Admiralty, to whom I intend to write a petition,
setting forth my case; if I succeed, I shall have wherewithal to give
you some assistance, because, when I left the ship, I had two years'
pay due to me, therefore I desire to know whither you are bound: and
besides, perhaps, I may have interest enough to procure a warrant
appointing you surgeon's mate of the ship to which I shall belong--for
the beadle of the Admiralty is my good friend: and he and one of the
under clerks are sworn brothers, and that under clerk has a good deal
to say with one of the upper clerks, who is very well known to the
under secretary, who, upon his recommendation, I hope, will recommend
my affair to the first secretary; and he again will speak to one of the
lords in my behalf; so that you see I do not want friends to assist me
on occasion. As for the fellow Craampley, thof I know him not, I am sure
he is neither seaman nor officer, by what you have told me, or else he
could never be so much mistaken in his reckoning, as to run the ship on
shore on the coast of Sussex before he believed himself in soundings;
