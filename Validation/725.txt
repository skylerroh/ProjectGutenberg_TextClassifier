  years ago]

CONQUEST OF PERU. Pizarro found the Incas divided as usual by civil
  wars and incapable of much resistance. One of their rival chiefs was
  outwitted when he tried to capture Pizarro by a trick, and was himself
  made a prisoner instead. He offered to give Pizarro in return for his
  freedom as much gold as would fill his prison room as high as he could
  reach. The offer was accepted, and gold, mainly in the shape of vases,
  plates, images, and other ornaments from the temples for the Indian
  idols, was gathered together.

  The Spaniards soon found themselves in possession of almost $7,000,000
  worth of gold, besides a vast quantity of silver. As much more was taken
  from the Indians by force. The whole was divided among the conquerors.
  Pizarro's share was worth nearly a million dollars. But the poor chief
  who had made them suddenly rich was suspected of plotting to have his
  warriors ambush them as they left the country, was tried by his
  conquerors, and put to death. The bloody work of conquest was soon over.
  Peru, like Mexico, rapidly became a center of Spanish settlement.
  Emigrants, instead of stopping in the West Indies, had the choice of
  going on into the newer regions which Cortes and Pizarro had won.

EMIGRANTS TO SPANISH AMERICA. It was much harder in the sixteenth
  century to leave Spain and settle in America than it is today. The first
  and sometimes the greatest difficulty was in getting permission to leave
  Spain. No one could go who had not secured the king's consent. The
  emigrant must show that neither he nor his father nor his grandfather
  had ever been guilty of heresy, that is, that he and his forefathers had
  been steadfast Catholic Christians. His wife, if he had one, must give
  her consent. His debts must all be paid. The Moors and the Jews of Spain
  could not secure permits to move to the New World. Foreigners of
  whatever nation were not wanted in the colonies and were usually kept
  out. Spain tried to keep its colonies wholly for Spaniards.

HARDSHIPS OF THE SEA VOYAGE. Those who did go to the colonies found
  the voyage dangerous and costly. One traveler has related that it cost
  him about one hundred and eighty dollars for the passage, and that he
  provided his own chickens and bread. The danger to sailing ships from
  storms was much greater than it is today for steamships. The voyage
  required three or four weeks and not uncommonly as many months.

THE NEED OF LABORERS. The hardships and dangers of the voyage and
  the reports of suffering from famine and disease kept most people from
  going to the New World. Emigration was slow, amounting to about a
  thousand a year. There were always fewer capable white laborers than the
  landowners in the colonies needed for their work, for there was much to
  do in clearing the land and preparing it for use. The landowners were
  usually well-to-do Spaniards who did not like to work in the fields
  themselves. A great many of the laborers who migrated to America served
  in the army or went to the gold and silver mines of Mexico and Peru. The
  craze for gold constantly robbed the older colonies of their farm
  laborers. The landowners in the islands of the West Indies, during the
  early history of the colonies, made slaves of the Indians and compelled
  them to take the place of the laborers they needed and could not obtain.

INDIAN SLAVERY. The people of Europe thought that the whole world
  belonged to the followers of Christ. Non-Christians, whether Indian or
  negro, had the choice of accepting Christianity or of being made slaves.
  The choice of Christianity did not always save them from the fate of
  slavery. In this the Spaniards were no more cruel than their neighbors
  the English or the French. The Spanish planters from the beginning
  forced the Indians to work their farms. The gold seekers made them work
  in their mines.

  The labor in every case was hard, and specially hard for the Indian
  unused to work. The overseers were brutal when the slaves did not do the
  tasks set for them. Hard usage and the unhealthful quarters rapidly
  broke down the natives. The white men also brought into the island
  diseases which they, with their greater experience, could resist, but
  from which, one writer says, the Indians died like sheep with a
  distemper.

  [Illustration: A SPANISH GALLEON Ships like this carried the
  Spanish emigrants to America]

SLAVERY DESTROYS THE WEST INDIANS. When the number of the Indians
  in Espanola and Cuba had decreased so much that there were not enough
  left to meet the needs of the planters, slave-hunters searched the
  neighboring islands for others. Finally, when the Indians were nearly
  gone, and the planters began to look to the mainland for their slaves,
  the king of Spain forbade making slaves of the Indians. Unfortunately he
  did not forbid them to capture negroes in Africa for the same purpose,
  and the change merely meant that negroes took the place of Indians as
  slaves. The story of the change is in great part the story of the life
  of Bartholomew de Las Casas.

LAS CASAS. The father of Las Casas was a companion of Columbus on
  his second voyage in 1493. He returned to Spain, taking with him a young
  Indian slave whom he gave to his son. This youth became greatly
  interested in the race to which his young slave belonged. In 1502 he
  went to Espanola to take possession of his father's estate. The
  planter's life did not long satisfy him and finally he became a priest.
  He moved from Espanola to Cuba, the newer colony.

  Las Casas became convinced that Indian slavery was wrong, and gave his
  own slaves their freedom. In his sermons he attacked the abuses of
  slavery. He visited Spain in order to help the slaves, and secured many
  reforms which lessened the hardships of their lot. Since the planters
  demanded more laborers and Las Casas thought the negro would be hardier
  than the Indian, he advocated negro slavery in place of Indian slavery
  as the less of two evils. Finally, in 1542, Las Casas persuaded his
  king, Charles V, to put an end to Indian slavery of every form.

  His success came too late to benefit the natives of the West Indies.
  They had decreased until almost none were left. It is said that there
  were two hundred thousand Indians in Espanola in 1492, and that in 1548
  there were barely five hundred survivors. The same decrease had taken
  place in the other islands. But the work of Las Casas came in time to
  save the Indians on the mainland from the fate of the luckless
  islanders.

NEGRO SLAVERY. Las Casas later regretted that he had advised the
  planters to obtain negroes to take the place of the Indians. Some
  negroes had been captured by the Portuguese on the coast of Africa
  during their explorations and taken to Europe as slaves. Columbus
  carried a few of these to the West Indies with him, and others had
  followed his example, but negro slavery had grown very slowly until
  after Las Casas stopped Indian slavery, when it increased rapidly in
  Spanish America.

  [Illustration: LAS CASAS After the picture by Felix Parra in the
  Academy, Mexico. Las Casas is supposed to be imploring Providence to
  shield the natives from Spanish cruelty]

THE MISSIONS OF THE MAINLAND. Las Casas became at one time a
  missionary to a tribe of the most desperate warriors located on the
  southern border of Mexico, in a region called by the Spaniards the "Land
  of War." Three times a Spanish army had invaded the country, and three
  times it had been driven back by the native defenders. Las Casas wished
  to show the Spaniards that more could be accomplished by treating the
  Indians kindly than by bloody warfare and conquest.

  He and the monks whom he took with him learned the language of the
  Indians, and went among them not as conquerors but as Christian
  teachers. Their gentle manners and endless patience won the friendship
  of the Indians in time and changed the land of constant warfare into one
  of peace. They led the natives to destroy their idols and to give up
  cannibalism. The mission established among them and kept up by the monks
  who were attracted to it was only one of a great number which sprang up
  on the mainland.

THE WORK OF THE MISSIONS. Influenced by the work of Las Casas
  against Indian slavery and for Indian missions, the Spaniards bent their
  efforts to preserve and Christianize the natives wherever they came upon
  them in America. Catholic priests gathered the Indians into permanent
  villages, which were called missions. Within about one hundred years
  after the death of Columbus, or by 1600, there were more then 5,000,000
  Indians in such villages under Spanish rule. Priests taught them to
  build better houses, checked their native vices, and suppressed heathen
  practices.

  Every mission became a little industrial school for children and parents
  alike, where all might learn the simpler arts and trades and the customs
  and language of their teachers. Each Indian cultivated his own plot of
  land and worked two hours a day on the farm belonging to the village.
  The produce of the village farm supported the church. The monks or
  friars who had charge of the mission cared for the poor, taught in the
  schools, preserved the peace and order of the village, and looked after
  the religious welfare of all.

  [Illustration: RUINS OF A SPANISH MISSION HOUSE]

  Gradually Spanish emigrants settled in the mission stations, and
  planters established farms around them, and they became Spanish villages
  in every respect like those in the islands or in the Old World, except
  that many inhabitants in the towns on the mainland were Indians. The
  emigrants freely intermarried with the Indians and a mixed race took the
  place of the old inhabitants. The customs, language, religion, and rule
  of Spain prevailed in this New Spain, though in some ways the new
  civilization was not so good as that of the Old World.

CHAPTER XVII


THE SPANISH EXPLORERS OF NORTH AMERICA

PONCE DE LEON. While men like Cortes were exploring and conquering
  the countries on the west shore of the Gulf of Mexico, others began to
  search the vast regions to the north. One of these explorers was Ponce
  de Leon, who had come to Espanola with Columbus in 1493. He afterwards
  spent many years in the West Indies capturing Indians, and understood
  from something they said that a magic fountain could be found beyond the
  Bahamas which would restore an old man to youth and vigor, if he
  bathed in it.

  [Illustration: PONCE DE LEON]

  As Ponce de Leon was beginning to feel aged he went in search of this
  wondrous fountain, but he found instead a coast where flowers grew in
  great abundance. It was the Easter season in 1513. Since the Spanish
  call this season _Pascua Florida_ or Flowery Easter, Ponce called the
  new flowery country Florida. He went ashore near the present site of St.
  Augustine, and later, while trying to establish a settlement, lost his
  life in a battle with the Indians.

EXPLORATIONS OF NORTH AMERICAN COAST. Other Spanish explorers
  between 1513 and 1525 followed the whole Gulf coast from Florida to Vera
  Cruz, and the Atlantic coast from Florida to Labrador. They sought
  continually for a passage to India. Every large inlet was entered, for
  it might prove to be the long-looked-for strait. Slowly the coast of
  North America took shape on the maps of that time. Two famous
  expeditions into the interior of the country did much to enlarge this
  knowledge. One was made by De Soto through the region which now forms
  seven southern states of the United States, and the other was by
  Coronado through the great southwest.

  [Illustration: HERNANDO DE SOTO]

DE SOTO. Hernando de Soto, a noble from Seville in Spain, had won
  fame and fortune with Pizarro in Peru. The King of Spain, to reward his
  bravery and skill in conquering Indians, made him Governor of Cuba. In
  those days the Governor of Cuba controlled Florida. It was a larger
  Florida than the present state of that name, for Spanish Florida
  included the whole north coast of the Gulf of Mexico running back into
  the continent without any definite boundary.

THE STORY OF THE GILDED MAN. De Soto had heard a fanciful story of
  a country so rich in gold that its king was smeared every morning with
  gum and then thickly sprinkled with powdered gold, which was washed off
  at night. De Soto thought this country might be somewhere in Florida,
  and prepared to search for the Gilded Man, or in the Spanish language
  _El Dorado._

THE COMRADES OF DE SOTO. More than six hundred men, some of them
  from the oldest families of the nobility of Spain and Portugal, flocked
  to De Soto's banner. They sold their possessions at home and ventured
  all their wealth in the hope of obtaining great riches in Florida.

DE SOTO'S ROUTE THROUGH THE SOUTH OF NORTH AMERICA. De Soto crossed
  from Cuba to the west coast of Florida in 1539, and advanced northward
  by land to an Indian village near Apalachee Bay. Here he spent the first
  winter. A white man, whom the Indians had taken captive twelve years
  before and finally adopted, joined De Soto and became very useful as an
  interpreter.

  [Illustration: SPANISH KNIGHT OF 16TH CENTURY]

  In the spring De Soto renewed his explorations. It was like a journey
  into the interior of Africa. The expedition passed northeasterly through
  the country now within Georgia and South Carolina, as far, perhaps, as
  the border of North Carolina. From here it passed through the mountains,
  and turned southwesterly through Tennessee and Alabama until a large
  Indian village called Mauvilla was reached. This was near the head of
  Mobile Bay. Mobile was named from the Indian village Mauvilla. The
  Alabama Indians, whose name means "the thicket clearers," were near by.
  Here again De Soto changed his course to the northwest into the
  unknown interior.

THE HARDSHIPS OF THE JOURNEY. His army was almost exhausted by the
  difficulties of the journey. A road had to be cut and broken through
  thickets and forest, paths had to be made through the many swamps, and
  fords found across the rivers. It frequently became necessary to stop
  for months at a time, to let the horses, worn out from travel and
  starving because of the scarcity of fodder, fatten on the grass. The
  stores which the army brought with them soon gave out. The men were
  forced to live like Indians, and were often reduced to using the roots
  of wild plants for food. Where they could, they robbed the Indians of
  their scanty stores of corn and beans.

  [Illustration: INDIANS BROILING FISH]

CRUEL TREATMENT OF THE INDIANS. De Soto was cruel in his treatment
  of the conquered natives along his route. Many of his officers came with
  him really for the purpose of obtaining Indian slaves for their
  plantations in Cuba. Indian women were made to do the work of the camp.
  Indian men were chained together and forced to carry the baggage. The
  chiefs were held as hostages for the good behavior of the whole tribe.
  The Indians who tried to shirk work or offered resistance were killed
  without mercy.

  [Illustration: MAP OF DE SOTO'S ROUTE--1539-1542]

  De Soto's cruelties made the Indian of the South hate the white men, and
  left him the enemy of any who should come to those regions in
  after-years. More than once De Soto narrowly escaped destruction at the
  hands of the enraged savages. They attacked the Spaniards with all their
  strength at Mauvilla, and again while they were in camp in northern
  Mississippi for the winter of 1540-1541. These two battles with the
  Indians cost the Spaniards their baggage, which was destroyed in the
  burning villages. New clothing, however, was soon made from the skins of
  wild animals. Deerskins and bearskins served for cloaks, jackets,
  shirts, stockings, and even for shoes. The great army must have looked
  much like a band of Robinson Crusoes.

THE DISCOVERY OF THE MISSISSIPPI. De Soto marched on northwesterly
  until May 8, 1541, when he was somewhere near the site of the present
  city of Memphis. There he came upon a great river. One of his officers
  tells us that the river was so wide at this point that if a man on the
  other side stood still, it could not be known whether he were a man or
  not; that the river was of great depth, and of a strong current; and
  that the water was always muddy.

  De Soto called it, in his own language, the Rio Grande or Great River,
  but the Indians called it the Mississippi. Americans have adopted the
  Indian name. Other Spanish explorers had probably passed the mouth of
  the Mississippi River before De Soto, and wondered at its mighty size,
  but De Soto was the first white man to approach it from the land and to
  appreciate the importance of his discovery.

WANDERINGS WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI. The Spaniards cut down trees,
  made them into planks and built barges on which they crossed the
  Mississippi. Then they wandered for another year through the endless
  woods and marshes of the low-lying lands now within the state of
  Arkansas. They probably went as far west as the open plains of Oklahoma
  or Texas. In these border regions between the forests and the prairies
  they met Indians who used the skins of the buffalo for clothing.

  [Illustration: BURIAL OF DE SOTO IN THE MISSISSIPPI]

DEATH AND BURIAL OF DE SOTO. The severe winter of 1541-1542
  discouraged the hardy travelers, who had now spent nearly three years in
  a vain search. The natives whom they had found made clothing from the
  fiber in the bark of mulberry trees and from the hides of buffaloes, and
  stored beans and corn for food, but such things seemed of little value
  to the seekers for the Gilded Man.

  De Soto returned to the Mississippi and prepared to establish a colony
