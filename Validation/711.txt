
 Alarming Sounds--Danger of the Scouts--Fremont Goes to Their
 Rescue--Arrival at Sutter's Fort--Ordered out of California by
 the Mexican Governor--Fremont's Refusal--Withdrawal to Sacramento
 River--Arrival of Despatches from Washington--War with Mexico--Meeting
 with Lieutenant Gillespie--Night Attack by Klamath Indians.

While preparing to go into camp, the explorers were mystified by
hearing a number of peculiar sounds like the barking of dogs. Attentive
listening, however, satisfied them that it came from an Indian village
close by, whose women and children were calling out and lamenting. This
constituted positive proof that the friends in advance were in trouble
with the red men and there was not a minute to lose in going to their
rescue.

A half mile further, the explorers galloped over a slight ridge, when
they suddenly came in sight of several hundred Indians, who were making
their way up two sides of a knoll, on the crest of which the four scouts
had entrenched themselves among the rocks and trees and were coolly
awaiting the attack of their enemies.

The little party had run so suddenly into danger that they were
compelled to make a flying leap from their horses, in order to secure
a suitable shelter. The assailants had almost captured the abandoned
horses, when relief came. The two Delawares made a dash to recover their
animals, their companions shooting the foremost of the thieves. The
property was saved and then all fell back to their own camp.

As the aboriginal horse thieves were so numerous, Fremont kept up
an unremitting watch all through the night. Singular noises were
continually heard and there could be no doubt that the women and
children were retreating further into the mountains.

One of the Delawares on guard was sure he saw an Indian leap over a log,
and firing quickly, brought him to the ground; but it proved to be a
prowling wolf. None of their enemies appeared, and when morning came,
Fremont withdrew from his perilous position.

Sutter's Fort at last was safely reached, and the other party having
become lost, Carson was sent to find them. He succeeded with little
difficulty and the companies reunited.

Their course was now directed toward Monterey on the sea coast, where
they were confident of securing all they needed, but before reaching the
place, a messenger arrived from General Castro, the Mexican commander of
the territory, ordering the Americans to leave at once or they would be
driven out.

Fremont immediately intrenched himself and waited for the Mexicans to
carry out their threat. He waited three days, and then, as no attempt
was made, withdrew to the Sacramento, which stream was followed to
Lawson's Trading Post, where the commander hoped to purchase the outfit
for the journey homeward.

Moving northward toward the Columbia, they encountered an enormous force
of marauding Indians with whom a fierce battle was fought. The savages
were defeated and lost a large number of warriors.

While encamped near Klamath Lake, two horsemen galloped up with
despatches to Fremont from Washington, forwarded by Lieutenant
Gillespie, of the United States Marines. This officer was making his way
through the Indian country with six men as an escort, when his animals
began to succumb. Fearing he would not be able to intercept the Captain,
the Lieutenant selected two of his best men and sent them ahead with the
despatches. He begged Fremont to forward him assistance, as he doubted
his ability to reach him without such help.

But the most startling news brought to camp was that war had been
declared between the United States and Mexico. When Fremont had read his
despatches from his Government, he appreciated the imminent danger in
which the Lieutenant was placed, and, without any tarrying, perfected
measures for his rescue.

He immediately selected ten of his men, Carson, as a matter of course
being among them, and pushed on with all haste, leaving directions for
the rest to follow as rapidly as they could.

Fremont and his little company had journeyed something over fifty miles
when they met the officer and his companions. The meeting was of the
happiest nature, for the Lieutenant, in fact, was in greater danger than
he suspected, the Indians around him being among the most treacherous of
their race.

Those who have been placed in a situation resembling in a slight degree
that of Fremont, can appreciate the interest with which he perused the
letters and papers from his distant home. After the parties had gone
into camp, the Captain sat up till after midnight reading by the light
of the camp fire. Tired out at last, he stretched out with his blanket
about him and sank soon into heavy slumber.

The night was cold, and Carson and Owens, with their saddle blankets
wrapped around them, lay down close to the fire. All at once Carson
heard a peculiar noise, as though some one had struck a quick blow
with an axe. Wondering what it could mean, he called to one of the
mountaineers.

"What's the matter over there?"

There was no answer, for the head of the poor fellow had been cleft by
an axe in the hands of one of the Klamath Indians who had crept into
camp. A Delaware had already been killed by the treacherous redskins,
that night being the second among all those spent in the west, when the
explorers had no sentinel on duty.

Carson and Owens called out "Indians!" and springing to their feet,
hurried away from the fire whose strong light was sure to tempt the aim
of their enemies.

One of the other Delawares who leaped to his feet snatched up the
nearest rifle which unfortunately was not his own, and was unloaded.
Unaware of the fact, he tried to fire it over again and again, without
suspecting the cause, while a Klamath launched arrow after arrow into
his body. The first penetrated his left breast and was fatal; but he
bravely kept his feet trying to discharge the useless gun, until four
other missiles were also buried within a few inches of the first.

Kit Carson had been quick to detect the danger of the brave Delaware,
and, in the hope of saving his life, he brought his unerring rifle to
his shoulder. Just as his finger pressed the trigger, he recollected
that that, too, was unloaded.

By one of those singular fatalities which sometimes occur, Carson had
broken the tube the night before, and left the weapon unloaded. Without
trifling with it, he threw it down, drew his single barrelled pistol
and ran toward the Klamath, who was coolly launching his arrows into the
breast of the poor Delaware.

The Indian leaped from side to side, so as to distract the aim of his
enemies, and, instead of hitting him, Carson only cut the string which
held a tomahawk to the warrior's arm. The mountaineer had no other shot
at command, and Maxwell tried his hand, but in the uncertain light,
inflicted only a slight wound. The Indian at that moment wheeled to run,
when one of the whites shot him dead. By this time the alarm was general
and the assailants fled.

There was good reason to believe that the Klamath Indians had set the
snare for Lieutenant Gillespie and his escort. As it was, the wonder was
that Fremont's command did not suffer to a greater extent; for having
no sentinels on duty, the warriors might have perfected their schemes in
security and killed a large number.

The Indian who drove five arrows into the left breast of the Delaware,
three of which pierced his heart, was the leader of the attacking party.
He had an English half axe slung to his wrist by a cord, and forty
arrows were left in his quiver. Carson pronounced them the most
beautiful and warlike missiles he had ever seen.

As may be supposed the explorers "slept on their arms" for the rest of
the night, but the assailants had fled.

They had killed three of the explorers, besides wounding another of the
Delawares, who took characteristic revenge by scalping the leader
that had been left where he fell. The dead were given the best burial
possible. As illustrating the ingratitude and perfidy of these red
men, it may be stated that it was only a few days before that they had
visited Fremont's camp, and, though provisions were very scarce, they
had been given considerable food, besides tobacco and a number of
presents.



CHAPTER XXVIII.


 Retaliatory Measures--Fremont's Return to California--Capture of
 Sonoma--Sutter's Fort Placed Under Military Rule--Monterey Taken
 by Commodore Sloat--Capture of Los Angeles by Fremont and Commodore
 Stockton--Carson Sent East as a Bearer of Despatches--The Meeting with
 Apaches--General Kearney--Bravery of the California Mexicans.

The indignation over the action of the Indians was so great that
retaliatory measures were determined upon. Fremont moved around Lake
Klamath until nearly opposite where his command had been attacked. The
following morning, Carson and ten men were sent forward to search
for the Indian village that was believed to be somewhere in the
neighborhood. If the discovery could be made without detection on the
part of the Indians, Carson was instructed to signal to Fremont who
would hasten forward with reinforcements.

The mountaineer had not gone far, when he struck a broad, clear trail,
which speedily carried him in sight of a village of some fifty lodges.
As it was evident that the Indians had detected their danger, Carson and
his companions made an impetuous attack before which the red men fled in
wildest panic. A number were shot, when, finding pursuit useless, Carson
returned to the village where all the lodges were destroyed.

Because of the war with Mexico, Fremont decided to return to California.
On his way thither, the Tlamath Indians continually dogged them and a
number of collisions followed, though none was of particular moment.
After suffering many hardships, Lawson's Fort was reached and several
days were spent in hunting, while Fremont awaited instructions as to the
course he was to take in the war then going on between the United States
and Mexico.

As the days went by without bringing him any despatches, he wearied of
inactivity and decided to assume the aggressive. Accordingly he sent
a force to a Mexican military post known as Sonoma, which with little
trouble was taken.

Fremont sent out a couple of messengers to inform the American settlers
of what had taken place, but the messengers fell into the hands of
General Castro who put both to death.

General Castro sent one of his captains, with quite a force to destroy
the Americans, but the officer changed his mind when he found himself
in the neighborhood of the detested invaders. Fremont pursued him for
nearly a week, and captured much of his stock and property, but the
Mexican was so skilful in retreating that he could not be brought to bay
and Fremont returned to Sonoma.

The little force under Fremont now became the rallying point for the
American settlers, and before long the Captain had several hundred under
his command. Leaving a garrison at Sonoma, he marched to Sutter's Fort,
which was placed under military rule, and then made his way toward
Monterey with the purpose of capturing that town. On his arrival,
however, he found the place had already been taken by Commodore
Sloat and the American squadron. The Commodore leaving shortly after,
Commodore Stockton succeeded him.

While at Sonoma, Fremont and his comrades had declared the independence
of California and adopted the Bear Flag, which was proffered to
Commodore Sloat and the Star Spangled Banner hoisted over the camp.

As the Mexican General, Castro, was known to be at Los Angeles, Fremont
asked for and obtained a ship on which his force was taken to San
Diego. Then with a much inferior force, he set out to give battle to the
Mexican leader; but the latter no sooner learned of his coming, than
he fled with all his men. Finding it impossible to force him to give
battle, Fremont encamped near the town, where he waited until joined by
Commodore Stockton and a company of marines.

The junction effected, they marched upon Los Angeles which immediately
fell into their hands. Long before this, Fremont had become impressed
with the necessity of having some communication with Washington. In
one sense it may be said he was all at sea, for he was without positive
instructions, at a critical period, when it was most important that his
line of policy should be clearly defined by his government.

But the matter of communicating with headquarters, thousands of miles
away, was infinitely more difficult and serious than it is today. A
vast, wild, perilous and almost unknown tract stretched between the
Pacific and Atlantic, across which it required weeks and sometimes
months for an express rider to make his way. To send despatches around
Cape Horn took a much longer time; but the necessity was so urgent
that Fremont sent Carson with fifteen picked men across the plains,
instructing him to complete the journey if possible in sixty days.

Carson started in the middle of September, 1846, and by the exercise of
his consummate skill he passed rapidly through a most dangerous section
without running into any special danger until the third day. Then, when
in the neighborhood of the copper mines of New Mexico, he suddenly came
upon an encampment of Apaches, one of the most hostile tribes and the
most daring of fighters in the whole southwest.

This was another of those critical occasions where Carson's wonderful
quickness of mind enabled him to make the right decision without a
second's delay. He understood the language, customs and peculiarities
of the people, and he knew them to be splendid riders and tiger-like
warriors. The least evidence of timidity would invite an overwhelming
attack: a bold front and what may be called indomitable "cheek" were all
that was likely to take them through.

Telling his men to halt, Carson galloped forward until within a few rods
of the warriors, when he reined up and called out that he wished to hold
a parley with them. Thereupon, a number advanced to hear what he had
to say. The mountaineer stated that he and his friends were simply
travellers through the Apache country; while they were prepared for war,
they desired peace, and as their animals were tired out they wished to
exchange them for fresh ones. The Apaches expressed themselves satisfied
with the proposal, and Carson carefully chose a camping site, where they
could best protect themselves against treachery. Then the exchange was
made, both parties being so well satisfied that they parted with many
expressions of good will.

It was impossible to carry any extended stock of provisions, the party
depending upon their rifles to supply their needs in that direction; but
game proved to be very scarce and they suffered much until they reached
the first Mexican settlement. Although those people were at war with the
United States, their friendship for Carson led them to supply abundantly
all the wants of himself and friends.

With unremitting diligence and skill, the party pushed on day after day
until the sixth of October, when, as they were riding across a treeless
prairie, several moving specks were observed in the far horizon. As they
came closer, they resolved themselves into horsemen, and, with a
delight which may be imagined, Carson speedily observed that they were
a detachment of United States troops under the command of General S. W.
Kearney, who was highly pleased to meet Carson.

The detachment was a strong one and was on its way to operate in
California. After that officer had obtained all the important news
Carson had to give, he decided to send the despatches to Washington by
another, while he employed the mountaineer to guide him back.

This delicate duty was executed with such admirable skill that General
Kearney commended Carson in the highest terms. So rapidly did they move
that California was entered early in December, and they were approaching
San Diego, when the scouts brought news that a large party of Mexicans
were intrenched a short distance ahead with the intention of disputing
their advance. Fifteen men under Carson were sent forward to drive in
the outposts and capture such loose animals as could be found.

A fierce fight followed, the Mexicans showing far more daring and skill
than was expected. General Kearney was compelled to send two companies
of dragoons and twenty-five California volunteers to charge the enemy.
Carson was in the front column, and was riding at high speed, when his
horse stumbled, throwing him so violently as to shatter the stock of
his gun. He lay partly stunned but speedily recovering, he caught up the
rifle of a dead dragoon and rushed into the fight. Though the Mexicans
were finally driven out, they inflicted frightful loss on the Americans.
Nearly every man who was in the front column, where Carson was riding
when his horse threw him, was killed by the deadly bullets of the enemy.

The Mexicans soon rallied and attacked the Americans with such
fierceness that the advance guard was driven back and forced to act on
the defensive. No soldiers could have fought with greater gallantry
than did the assailants. Before the two mountain howitzers could
be unlimbered, almost every man around them was shot down. Then the
Mexicans charged forward, lassoed the horses, captured one of the guns
and turned it on the Americans. From some cause or other it could not
be discharged. Finally, the Americans took refuge among the rocks, where
they were surrounded by three or four times their number, seemingly with
the choice of two courses before them--to surrender or starve to death.



CHAPTER XXIX.


 Daring Exploit of Kit Carson and Lieutenant Beale--General Kearney
 Saved.

The situation of General Kearney and his men could not have been more
desperate. The only subsistence they had were their mules, and the water
was insufficient to meet their wants. They were completely surrounded by
