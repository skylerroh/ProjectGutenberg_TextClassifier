PREFACE


Seldom does a book of poems appear that is definitely a response to
demand and a reflection of readers' preferences. Of this collection that
can properly be claimed. For a decade NORMAL INSTRUCTOR-PRIMARY PLANS
has carried monthly a page entitled "Poems Our Readers Have Asked For."
The interest in this page has been, and is, phenomenal. Occasionally
space considerations or copyright restrictions have prevented compliance
with requests, but so far as practicable poems asked for have been
printed. Because it has become impossible to furnish many of the earlier
issues of the magazine, the publishers decided to select the poems most
often requested and, carefully revising these for possible errors, to
include them in the present collection. In some cases the desired poems
are old favorite dramatic recitations, but many of them are poems that
are required or recommended for memorizing in state courses of study.
This latter feature will of itself make the book extremely valuable to
teachers throughout the country. We are glad to offer here certain
poems, often requested, but too long for insertion on our magazine
Poetry Page. We are pleased also to be able to include a number of
popular copyright poems. Special permission to use these has been
granted through arrangement with the authorized publishers, whose

O Captain! My Captain!

(_This poem was written in memory of Abraham Lincoln._)


O Captain! My Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won;
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
  But, O heart! heart! heart!
      O the bleeding drops of red,
  Where on the deck my Captain lies,
      Fallen, cold and dead.

O Captain! My Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills,
For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding,
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
  Here Captain! dear father!
      This arm beneath your head!
  It is some dream that on the deck
     You've fallen cold and dead.

My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse or will;
The ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
  Exult, O shores! and ring, O bells!
      But I, with mournful tread,
  Walk the deck my Captain lies,
      Fallen, cold and dead.

    _Walt Whitman._




A Poet's Prophecy


For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,
Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;
Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,
Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales;
Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rained a ghastly dew
From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue;
Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm,
With the standards of the peoples plunging through the thunderstorm;
Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battleflags were furl'd
In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.
There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,
And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.

    _Tennyson, "Locksley Hall," 1842._




The Landing of the Pilgrims


The breaking waves dashed high
  On a stern and rock-bound coast,
And the woods against a stormy sky
  Their giant branches tossed;

And the heavy night hung dark
  The hills and waters o'er,
When a band of exiles moored their bark
  On the wild New England shore.

Not as the conqueror comes,
  They, the true-hearted, came,--
Not with the roll of the stirring drums,
  And the trumpet that sings of fame;

Not as the flying come,
  In silence and in fear;
They shook the depths of the desert's gloom
  With their hymns of lofty cheer.

Amidst the storms they sang;
  And the stars heard, and the sea;
And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang
  To the anthem of the free.

The ocean eagle soared
  From his nest by the white wave's foam;
And the rocking pines of the forest roared--
  This was their welcome home!

There were men with hoary hair
  Amidst that pilgrim band:
Why had they come to wither there
  Away from their childhood's land?

There was woman's fearless eye,
  Lit by her deep love's truth;
There was manhood's brow serenely high,
  And the fiery heart of youth.

What sought they thus afar?
  Bright jewels of the mine?
The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?--
  They sought a faith's pure shrine.

Ay, call it holy ground,--
  The soil where first they trod!
They have left unstained what there they found--
  Freedom to worship God!

    _Felicia Hemans._




Bobby Shaftoe


"Marie, will you marry me?
For you know how I love thee!
Tell me, darling, will you be
  The wife of Bobby Shaftoe?"

"Bobby, pray don't ask me more,
For you've asked me twice before;
Let us be good friends, no more,
  No more, Bobby Shaftoe."

"If you will not marry me,
I will go away to sea;
And you ne'er again shall be
  A friend of Bobby Shaftoe."

"Oh, you will not go away
For you've said so twice to-day.
Stop! He's gone! Dear Bobby, stay!
  Dearest Bobby Shaftoe!

"Bobby Shaftoe's gone to sea,
Silver buckles on his knee,
But he'll come back and marry me,
  Pretty Bobby Shaftoe.

"He will soon come back to me,
And how happy I shall be,
He'll come back and marry me,
  Dearest Bobby Shaftoe."

"Bobby Shaftoe's lost at sea,
He cannot come back to thee.
And you ne'er again will see
  Your dear Bobby Shaftoe.

"Oh, we sadly mourn for thee,
And regret we ne'er shall see
Our friend Bobby, true and free,
  Dearest Bobby Shaftoe."

"Bobby Shaftoe's lost at sea.
And can ne'er come back to me,
