the great loss he would be, Harry Vane burst into tears and declared
he would stay, only he could not bear all the squabbling that had
been going on, nor to hear it constantly said that he was the cause
of it.

Then, when the Council declared that if that was the only reason
he had for going they could not give him leave, he repented of
what he had said, and declared he must go for reasons of private
business, and that anything else he had said was only said in
temper.  Whereupon the court consented in silence to his going.

All this was not very dignified for the Governor of a state, but
hardly surprising from a passionate youth who had undertaken a task
too difficult for him, and felt himself a failure.  However Vane
did not go.  He stayed on to the end of his time, and even sought
to be re-elected.

But feeling against him was by this time far too keen.  He was
rejected as Governor, and not even chosen as one of the Council.
This hurt him deeply, he sulked in a somewhat undignified manner,
and at length in August sailed home, never to return.

He had flashed like a brilliant meteor across the dull life of the
colony.  He made strife at the time, but afterwards there was no
bitterness.  When the colonists were in difficulties they were ever
ready to ask help from Harry Vane, and he as readily gave it.  Even
his enemies had to acknowledge his uprightness and generosity. "At
all times," wrote his great-hearted adversary, Winthrop, "he showed
himself a true friend to New England, and a man of noble and generous
mind."

He took a great part in the troublous times which now came upon
England, and more than twenty years later he died bravely on the
scaffold for the cause to which he had given his life.

Chapter 25 - The Story of Anne Hutchinson and the Founding of Rhode
Island




About a year before Harry Vane came to Massachusetts another
interesting and brilliant colonist arrived.  This was a woman named
Anne Hutchinson.  She was clever, "a woman of a ready wit and bold
spirit." Like Williams she was in advance of her times, and like
him she soon became a religious leader.  She was able, she was deeply
interested in religion, and she saw no reason why women should not
speak their minds on such matters.

Men used to hold meetings to discuss questions of religion and
politics to which women were not allowed to go.  Anne Hutchinson
thought this was insulting; and she began to hold meetings for
women in her own home.  These meetings became so popular that often
as many as a hundred women would be present.  They discussed matters
of religion, and as Mrs.  Hutchinson held "dangerous errors" about
"grace and works" and justification and sanctification, this set
the whole colony agog.

By the time that Harry Vane was chosen Governor the matter had
become serious.  All the colony took sides for or against.  Harry Vane,
who stood for toleration and freedom, sided with Mrs.  Hutchinson,
while Winthrop, his great rival, sided against her.  Mrs.  Hutchinson
was supported and encouraged in her wickedness by her brother-in-law
John Wheelright, a "silenced minister sometimes in England." She
also led away many other godly hearts.

The quarrel affected the whole colony, and was a stumbling-block
in the way of all progress.  But so long as Harry Vane was Governor,
Mrs.  Hutchinson continued her preaching and teaching.  When he sailed
home, however, and Winthrop was Governor once more, the elders
of the community decided that Mrs.  Hutchinson was a danger to the
colony, and must be silenced.  So all the elders and leaders met
together in assembly, and condemned her opinions, some as being
"blasphemous, some erroneous, and all unsafe."

A few women, they decided, might without serious wrong meet together
to pray and edify one another.  But that a large number of sixty
or more should do so every week was agreed to be "disorderly and
without rule." And as Mrs.  Hutchinson would not cease her preaching
and teaching, but obstinately continued in her gross errors, she
was excommunicated and exiled from the colony.

Like Williams, Mrs.  Hutchinson went to Rhode Island.  To the sorrow
of the godly, her husband went with her.  And when they tried to
bring him back he refused. "For," he said, "I am more dearly tied
to my wife than to the Church.  And I do think her a dear saint and
servant of God."

In Rhode Island Mrs.  Hutchinson and her friends founded the towns
of Portsmouth and Newport.  Others who had been driven out of one
colony or another followed them, and other towns were founded;
and for a time Rhode Island seems to have been a sort of Ishmael's
land, and the most unruly of all the New England colonies.  At
length however all these little settlements joined together under
one Governor.

At first the colony had no charter, and occupied the land only
by right of agreement with the Indians.  But after some time Roger
Williams got a charter from Charles II.  In this charter it was
set down that no one should be persecuted "for any difference in
opinion on matters of religion." Thus another new state was founded,
and in Rhode Island there was more real freedom than in almost any
other colony in New England.

Massachusetts was at this time, as we can see, not exactly an
easy place to live in for any one whose opinions differed in the
slightest from those laid down by law.  Those same people who had
left their homes to seek freedom of conscience denied it to others.
But they were so very, very sure that their way was the only
right way, that they could not understand how any one could think
otherwise.  They were good and honest men.  And if they were severe
with their fellows who strayed from the narrow path, it was only
in the hope that by punishing them in this life, they might save
them from much more terrible punishment in the life to come.

Chapter 26 - The Founding of Harvard




One very good thing we have to remember about the first settlers of
Massachusetts is that early in the life of the colony they founded
schools and colleges.  A good many of the settlers were Oxford and
Cambridge men, though more indeed came from Cambridge than from
Oxford, as Cambridge was much the more Puritan of the two.  But
whether from Oxford or from Cambridge they were eager that their
children born in this New England should have as good an education
as their fathers had had in Old England.  So when Harry Vane was
Governor the colonists voted £400 with which to build a school.
This is the first time known to history that the people themselves
voted their own money to found a school.

It was decided to build the school at "Newtown." But the Cambridge
men did not like the name, so they got it changed to Cambridge,
"to tell their posterity whence they came."

Shortly before this a young Cambridge man named John Harvard had
come out to Massachusetts.  Very little is known of him save that he
came of simple folk, and was good and learned. "A godly gentleman
and lover of learning," old writers call him. "A scholar and pious
in his life, and enlarged towards the country and the good of it,
in life and in death."

Soon after he came to Boston this godly gentleman was made minister
of the church at Charlestown.  But he was very delicate and in a
few months he died.  As a scholar and a Cambridge man he had been
greatly interested in the building of the college at Cambridge.  So
when he died he left half his money and all his books to it.  The
settlers were very grateful for this bequest, and to show their
gratitude they decided to name the college after John Harvard.

Thus the first University in America was founded.  From the beginning
the college was a pleasant place, "more like a bowling green than
a wilderness," said one man. "The buildings were thought by some to
be too gorgeous for a wilderness, and yet too mean in others'
apprehensions for a college. "

"The edifice," says another, "is very faire and comely within and
without, having in it a spacious hall, and a large library with
some bookes to it."

Of Harvard's own books there were nearly three hundred, a very good
beginning for a library in those far-off days.  But unfortunately
they were all burnt about a hundred years later when the library
accidentally took fire.  Only one book was saved, as it was not in
the library at the time.

Harvard's books are gone, nor does anything now remain of the first
buildings "so faire and comely within and without." But the memory
of the old founders and their wonderful purpose and energy is still
kept green, and over the chief entrance of the present buildings
are carved some words taken from a writer of those times. "After
God had carried us safe to New England, and we had builded our
houses, provided necessaries for our livelihood, rear'd convenient
places for God's worship, and settled the Civil Government, one
of the next things we longed for and looked after was to advance
learning and perpetuate it to Posterity, dreading to leave
an illiterate ministry to the Churches when our present ministers
shall be in the Dust."

John Harvard was a good and simple man.  In giving his money to
found a college he had no thought of making himself famous.  But "he
builded better than he knew," for he reared for himself an eternal
monument, and made his name famous to all the ends of the earth.
And when kings and emperors are forgotten the name of Harvard will
be remembered.

Chapter 27 - How Quakers First Came to New England




It was about the middle of the seventeenth century when a new kind
of religion arose.  This was the religion of the Quakers.  George
Fox was the founder of this sect, and they called themselves the
Friends of Truth.  The name Quaker was given to them by their enemies
in derision because they "trembled before the Lord."

The Quakers were a peace-loving people; they tried to be kind and
charitable; they refused to go to law; and they refused to fight.
They also gave up using titles of all kinds.  For, "my Lord Peter
and my Lord Paul are not to be found in the Bible." They refused
to take off their hats to any man, believing that that was a sign
of worship which belonged to God only.  They refused also to take
oath of any kind, even the oath of allegiance to the King, because
Christ had said, "Swear not at all." They used "thee" and "thou"
instead of "you" in speaking to a single person (because they thought
it more simple and truthful), and they refused to say "goodnight"
or "goodmorrow," "for they knew night was good and day was good
without wishing either." There was a great deal that was good in
their religion and very little, it would seem, that was harmful,
but they were pronounced to be "mischievous and dangerous people."

Men did not understand the Quakers.  And, as often happens when men
do not understand, they became afraid of them.  Because they wore
black clothes and broad-brimmed hats they thought they must be
Jesuits in disguise.  So ignorance bred fear, and fear brought forth
persecution, and on all sides the Quakers were hunted and reviled.
They were fined and imprisoned scourged and exiled and sold into
slavery.  Then, like other persecuted people, they sought a refuge
in New England across the seas.  But the people there were just as
ignorant as the people at home, and the Quakers found no kindly
welcome.

The first Quakers to arrive in New England were two women.  But
before they were allowed to land officers were sent on board the
ship to search their boxes.  They found a great many books, which
they carried ashore, and while the women were kept prisoner on board
the ship the books were burned in the market place by the common
hangman.  Then the women were brought ashore and sent to prison,
for no other reason than that they were Quakers.

No one was allowed to speak to them on pain of a fine of £5, and
lest any should attempt it even the windows of the prison were
boarded up.  They were allowed no candle, and their pens, ink, and
paper were taken from them.  They might have starved but that one
good old man named Nicholas Upshal, whose heart was grieved for
them, paid the gaoler to give them food.  Thus they were kept until
a ship was ready to sail for England.  Then they were put on board,
and the captain was made to swear that he would put them ashore
nowhere but in England.

"Such," says an old writer, "was the entertainment the Quakers first
met with at Boston, and that from a people who pretended that for
conscience' sake they had chosen the wilderness of America before
the well-cultivated Old England."

The next Quakers who arrived were treated much in the same fashion
and sent back to England; and a law was made forbidding Quakers
to come to the colony.  At this time the same good old man who had
already befriended them was grieved. "Take heed," he said, "that
you be not found fighting against God, and so draw down a judgment
upon the land." But the men of Boston were seized with a frenzy of
hate and fear, and they banished this old man because he had dared
to speak kindly of the accursed sect."

It is true the men of New England had some excuse for trying to keep
the Quakers out of their colony.  For some of them were foolish, and
tried to force their opinions noisily upon others.  They interrupted
the Church services, mocked the magistrates and the clergy, and
some, carried away by religious fervour, behaved more like mad folk
than the disciples of a religion of love and charity.

Yet in spite of the law forbidding them to come, Quakers kept on
coming to the colony, and all who came were imprisoned, beaten,
and then thrust forth with orders never to return.  But still they
came.  So a law was made that any Quaker coming into the colony
should have one of his ears cut off; if he came again he should
have a second ear cut off; if he came a third time he should have
his tongue bored through with a hot iron.

But even this cruel law had no effect upon the Quakers.  They heeded
it not, and came in as great or even greater numbers than before.

The people of Boston were in despair.  They had no wise to be cruel;
indeed, many hated, and were thoroughly ashamed of, the cruel
laws, made against these strange people.  But they were nevertheless
determined that Quakers should not come into their land.  So now
they made a law that any Quaker who came to the colony and refused
to go away again when ordered should be hanged.  This, they thought,
would certainly keep these pernicious folk away.  But it did not.

For the Quakers were determined to prove to all the world that they
were free to go where they would, and that if they chose to come
to Boston no man-made laws should keep them out.  So they kept on
coming.  The magistrates knew not what to do.  They had never meant
to hang any of them, but only to frighten them away.  But having
made the law, they were determined to fulfil it, and five Quakers
were hanged, one of them a woman.  But while the fifth was being
tried another Quaker named Christison, who had already been banished,
calmly walked into the court.

When they saw him the magistrates were struck dumb.  For they saw
that against determination like this no punishment, however severe,
might avail.  On their ears Christison's words fell heavily.

"I am come here to warn you, he cried, "that you should shed no more
innocent blood.  For the blood that you have shed already cries to
the Lord God for vengeance to come upon you."

Nevertheless he too was seized and tried.  But he defended himself
well.  By what law will you put me to death?" he asked.

"We have a law," replied the magistrates, "and by our law you are
to die."

"So said the Jews to Christ," replied Christison: " 'We have a law,
and by our law you ought to die.' Who empowered you to make that
law? How! Have you power to make laws different from the laws of
England?"

"No," said the Governor.

"Then," said Christison, "you are gone beyond your bounds.  Are you
subjects to the King? Yea or nay?"

"Yea, we are so."

"Well," said Christison, "so am I.  Therefore, seeing that you and
I are subjects to the King, I demand to be tried by the laws of
my own nation.  For I never heard, nor read, of any law that was in
England to hang Quakers."

Yet in spite of his brave defence Christison was condemned to
death.  But the sentence was never carried out.  For the people had
grown weary of these cruelties; even the magistrates, who for a
time had been carried away by blind hate, saw that they were wrong.
Christison and many of his friends who had lain in prison awaiting
trial were set free.

The Quakers, too, now found a strange friend in King Charles.  For
the doings of the New Englanders in this matter reached even his
careless ears, and he wrote to his "Trusty and well-beloved" subjects
bidding them cease their persecutions, and send the Quakers back
to England to be tried.  This the people of Massachusetts never did.
But henceforth the persecutions died down.  And although from time
to time the Quakers were still beaten and imprisoned no more were
put to death.  At length the persecution died away altogether and
the Quakers, allowed to live in peace, became quiet, hard-working
citizens.

Chapter 28 - How Maine and New Hampshire Were Founded




North of Massachusetts two more colonies, New Hampshire and Maine,
were founded.  But they were not founded by men who fled from tyranny,
but by statesmen and traders who realised the worth of America,
not by Puritans, but by Churchmen and Royalists.  The two men who
were chiefly concerned in the founding of these colonies were Sir
Ferdinando Gorges and Captain John Mason.  They were both eager
colonists, and they both got several charters and patents from the
King, and from the New England Company.

It would be too confusing to follow all these grants and charters,
or all the attempts at settlements made by Mason and Gorges and
others.  The land granted to them was often very vaguely outlined,
the fact being that the people who applied for the land, and those
who drew up the charters, had only the vaguest ideas concerning the
land in question.  So the grants often overlapped each other, and
the same land was frequently claimed by two people, and of course
confusion and quarrels followed.

In 1629 Mason and Gorges, being friends, agreed to divide the province
of Maine between them, and Mason called his part New Hampshire,
after the county of Hampshire in England, of which he was fond.
Mason and Gorges each now had an enormous tract of land, but they
wanted still more.

The French, as you know, had already made settlements in Canada,
But just at this time that buccaneering sea captain, David Kirke,
besieged Quebec, took it and carried its brave governor, Champlain,
away prisoner.  Now, as soon as they heard of this Gorges and Mason
asked the King to give them a grant of part of the conquered land,
for it was known to be a fine country for fur trade, and was also
believed to be rich in gold and silver mines.  In answer to this
petition the King granted a great tract of land to Gorges and Mason.
This they called Laconia, because it was supposed to contain many
lakes.  They never did much with it however, and in a few years
when peace was made with France it had all to be given back to the
French.

Both Mason and Gorges spent a great deal of money trying to encourage
colonists to settle on their land, and the people of Massachusetts
were not at all pleased to have such powerful Churchmen for their
neighbours.

As has been said, land grants often overlapped, and part of the
land granted to Gorges and Mason was also claimed by Massachusetts.
The Massachusetts colonists insisted on their rights.  Both Gorges
and Mason therefore became their enemies, and did their best
to have their charter taken away.  To this end Gorges got himself
made Governor General of the whole of New England, with power to
do almost as he liked, and he made ready to set out for his new
domain with a thousand soldiers to enforce his authority.

When this news reached Massachusetts the whole colony was thrown
into a state of excitement.  For in this appointment the settlers
saw the end of freedom, the beginning of tyranny.  Both Gorges and
his friend Mason were zealous Churchmen and the Puritans felt sure
would try to force them all to become Churchmen also.

This the settlers determined to resist with all their might.  So
they built forts round Boston Harbour and mounted cannon ready to
sink any hostile vessel which might put into port.  In every village
the young men trained as soldiers, and a beacon was set up on
the highest point of the triple hill upon which Boston is built.
And daily these young men turned their eyes to the hill, for when
a light appeared there they knew it would be time to put on their
steel caps and corslets and march to defend their liberties.  Ever
since the hill has been called Beacon Hill.

But the danger passed.  The new ship which was being built for
Ferdinando Gorges mysteriously fell to pieces on the very launching
of it, and Captain Mason died. "He was the chief mover in all the
attempts against us," says Winthrop. "But the Lord, in His mercy,
taking him away, all the business fell on sleep."

But still Gorges did not give up his plans.  He did not now go out
to New England himself as he had meant to do, but sent first his
nephew and then his cousin instead.  They, however, did not trouble
Massachusetts much.

Over the Province of Maine, Sir Ferdinando ruled supreme.  He could
raise troops, make war, give people titles, levy taxes.  No one
might settle down or trade in his province without his permission,
and all must look upon him as the lord of the soil and pay him
tribute.  It was the feudal system come again, and Sir Ferdinando
Gorges was as near being a king as any ruler of America ever has
been.  He drew up a most elaborate constitution, too, for his kingdom,
making almost more offices than there were citizens to fill them.
For, after all, his kingdom was a mere wilderness containing two
fishing villages and here and there a few scattered settlements.
And when the deputy governor arrived to rule this kingdom he found
his "palace" merely a broken-down store house with "nothing of
household stuff remaining but an old pot, a pair of tongs and a
couple of irons."

Thus side by side with the Puritan colonies of New England,
colonies which were almost republics, there was planted a feudal
state which was almost a monarchy.  Of all the New England colonies,
New Hampshire and Maine were the only two which were not founded
for the sake of religion.  For although the English Church was
established in both as the state religion that was merely because
the proprietors were of that Church.  The colonies were founded for
the sake of trade and profit.  But they grew very slowly.

In 1647 Sir Ferdinando Gorges died, and Maine was left much to
itself.  For his son John took little interest in his father's great
estate.  Thirty years later his grandson, another Ferdinando, sold
his rights to Massachusetts.  From that time till 1820, when it
was admitted to the Union as a separate state, Maine was a part of
Massachusetts.

Neither did the heirs of Mason pay much attention to their estates
at first.  And when they did there was a good deal of quarrelling
and a good deal of trouble, and at length they sold their rights
to twelve men, who were afterwards known as the Masonian Proprietors.

There was a great deal of trouble, too, before New Hampshire was
finally recognised as a separate colony.  It was joined to Massachusetts
and separated again more than once.  But at last, after many changes,
New Hampshire finally became a recognised separate colony.  And
although Captain John Mason died long before this happened he has
been called the founder of New Hampshire.

"If the highest moral honour," it has been said, "belongs to founders
of states, as Bacon has declared, then Mason deserved it.  To seize
on a tract of the American wilderness, to define its limits, to give
it a name, to plant it with an English colony, and to die giving
it his last thoughts among worldly concerns, are acts as lofty and
noble as any recorded in the history of colonisation."

Chapter 29 - The Founding of Connecticut and War with the Indians




Many of the people who founded Massachusetts Colony were well-to-do
people, people of good family, aristocrats in fact.  They were men
accustomed to rule, accustomed to unquestioning obedience from their
servants and those under them.  They believed that the few were meant
to rule, and the many meant to obey.  The idea that every grown-up
person should have a share in the government never entered their
heads.  Their Governor, Winthrop, was an aristocrat to the backbone.
He believed heartily in the government of the many by the few, and
made it as difficult as possible for citizens to obtain the right
of voting.

But there were many people who were discontented with this
aristocratic rule.  Among them was a minister named Thomas Hooker,
like John Harvard a graduate of Emmanuel College, Cambridge.

So, being dissatisfied, he and his congregation decided to move
away and found a new colony.  They were the more ready to do this,
as the land round Boston was not fertile, and so many new settlers
had come, and their cattle and flocks had increased so rapidly,
that it was already difficult to find food and fodder for man and
beast.  Adventurers who had traveled far afield had brought back
glowing reports of the beauty and fertility of the Connecticut
Valley, and there Hooker decided to settle.

But for several reasons many of the people of Massachusetts objected
to his going.  He and his people, they said, would be in danger from
the Dutch, who already had a settlement there, and who claimed the
whole valley.  They would also be in danger from the Indians, who
were known to be hostile, and lastly, they would be in danger from
the British Government because they had no charter permitting them
to settle in this land.  The people at home, they said, "would not
endure they should sit down without a patent on any place which
our King lays claim unto."

The people of Massachusetts were keeping quiet and going along
steadily in their own way, without paying any heed to the British
Government.  They wanted to be left alone, and they did not want
any one else to do things which might call attention to them.
And besides all this they were greatly troubled at the thought
of losing an eloquent preacher like Hooker.  Every church was like
a candlestick giving light to the world. "And the removing of
a candlestick," they said, "is a great judgment, which is to be
avoided."

But in spite of all arguments Hooker determined to go.  So one June
morning he and his congregation set forth.  They sent their furniture
by water and they themselves, both men and women, started to walk
the hundred miles, driving their cattle before them; only Mrs.
Hooker, who was ill, being carried in a litter.

They went slowly, allowing the cattle to graze by the wayside, living
chiefly on the milk of the cows and the wild fruits they found.
It was no easy journey, for their way led through the pathless
wilderness, their only guides being the compass and the sun.  For in
those days we must remember that beyond the settlements the whole
of America was untrodden ground.  Save the Indian trails there were
no roads.  Here they had to fell trees and make a rough bridge to
cross a stream; there they hewed their way through bushy undergrowth.
Again they climbed steep hillsides or picked their way painfully
through swamps, suffering many discomforts and fatigues.

But there were delights, too, for the sky was blue above them:
birds sang to them night and morning, and wild flowers starred the
ground and scented the air.  All day they marched beneath the sunny
blue sky, every evening they lit their watch-fires as a protection
against wild beasts and lay down to rest beneath the stars, for
"they had no cover but the heavens, nor any lodgings but those
which simple nature afforded them."

For a fortnight they journeyed thus through the wilderness.  Then
they reached the Connecticut River and their journey's end.  And
here they built a little town which they called Hartford.

Other communities followed the example of Hooker and his flock,
and Wethersfield and Windsor were built.  At first all these towns
remained a part of Massachusetts in name at least.  But after a time
the settlers met together at Hartford and, agreeing to form a little
republic of their own, they drew up a set of rules for themselves;
the chief difference from those of Massachusetts being that the
religious tests were done away with, and a man need no longer be a
member of a church in order to have the right to vote.  It is also
interesting to remember that in these Fundamental Orders, as they
called their Constitution, there is no mention of the British
King or Government.  These colonists had settled new land without a
charter, and they made laws without recognising any authority but
their own.  Thus the Colony of Connecticut was founded.

Besides these towns, John Winthrop, the son of the Governor
of Massachusetts, founded a fort at the mouth of the Connecticut
River.  For he saw it was a good place for trade with the Indians.
This fort was called SayeBrook after Lord Saye and Sele and Lord
Brook, two Puritan lords who had obtained a grant of land along
the Connecticut River.

But this new colony was very nearly wiped out as soon as begun.
For one of the dangers which the people of Massachusetts foretold
proved a very real one.  This was the danger from the Indians.  The
Indians are divided into several families, such as the Algonquins,
the Hurons, the Iroquois, each of these families again containing
many tribes.  All the Indians in New England belonged to the Algonquin
family, but were, of course, divided into many tribes.  One of these
tribes was called the Pequots.  They were very powerful, and they
tyrannised over the other tribes round about.  They hated the white
men, and whenever they had the opportunity they slew them.

The new Colony of Connecticut was far nearer their hunting-ground
than Massachusetts.  It was a far easier prey, and from the very
beginning the Pequots harassed the settlers.  They made no open
attack, but skulked about, murdering men and women, now here, now
there, appearing suddenly and vanishing again as swiftly.

This sort of thing could not be endured, and the English determined
to put a stop to it.  So messengers were sent to the Indians to
demand that the murderers should be given up to the English.  When
the Indians saw the English boats appear they did not seem in the
least afraid, but came running along the water-side shouting, "What
cheer, Englishmen, what cheer? What do you come for?"

But the Englishmen would not answer.

And the Pequots, never thinking that the Englishmen meant war, kept
running on beside the boats as they sailed up the river.

"What cheer, Englishmen, what cheer?" they kept repeating. "Are
you angry? Will you kill us? Do you come to fight?"

But still the Englishmen would not answer.

Then the Indians began to be afraid.  And that night they built
great fires on either side of the river, fearing lest the Englishmen
might land in the darkness.  All night long, too, they kept up a
most doleful howling, calling to each other and passing the word
on from place to place to gather the braves together.

Next morning early they sent an ambassador to the English captain.
He was a big, splendid-looking man, very grave and majestic. "Why
do you come here?" he asked.

"I have come," answered the captain, "to demand the heads of those
who have slain our comrades.  It is not the habit of the English to
suffer murderers to live.  So if you desire peace and welfare give
us the heads of the murderers."

"We knew not," answered the wily Indian, "that any of our braves
had slain any of yours.  It is true we have slain some white men.  But
we took them to be Dutch.  It is hard for us to know the difference
between Dutch and English."

"You know the difference between Dutch and English quite well,"
answered the captain sternly. "And therefore seeing you have slain
the King of England's subjects, we come to demand vengeance for
their blood."

"We knew no difference between the Dutch and English," declared
the Indian. "They are both strangers to us, and we took them to be
all one.  Therefore we crave pardon.  We have not wilfully wronged
the English."

"That excuse will not do," insisted the captain. "We have proof
that you know the English from the Dutch.  We must have the heads of
those persons who have slain our men, or else we will fight you."

Then, seeing that he could not move the English captain from his
determination, the ambassador asked leave to go back to his chief,
promising to return speedily with his answer.  He was allowed to go;
but as he did not return very soon the Englishmen followed.  Seeing
this, the ambassador hurried to them, begging them not to come
nearer, and saying that his chief could not be found, as he had
gone to Long Island.

"That is not true," replied the English. "We know he is here.  So
find him speedily or we will march through the country and spoil
your corn."

Hour after hour went past; the Englishmen always patiently waiting;
the wily Indian always inventing some new excuse for delay.  But
at length the patience of the English was exhausted, and, beating
