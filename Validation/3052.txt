
"Poor things! Poor things!" the woman said, shaking her head.  "It
is terrible! My husband was telling me what he saw; and a neighbour
came in just now and said it was the same thing at all the other
prisons. The priest, too--our priest at the little church at the
corner of the street, where I used to go in every morning to pray
on my way to market--he was dragged away ten days ago to the
Carmelites, and now he is a saint in heaven. How is it, sir, that
God allows such things to be?"

"We cannot tell," Harry said sadly. "As for myself, I can hardly
believe it, though I saw it. They say there are over four thousand
people in the prisons, and they will all be murdered. Such a thing
was never heard of. I can hardly believe that I am not in a dream
now."

"You look almost like one dead yourself," the woman said pityingly.
"I have made a bouillon for Jacques' breakfast and mine.  It is
just ready. Do take a mouthful before you go out. That and a piece
of bread and a cup of red wine will do you good."

Harry was on the point of refusing; but he felt that he was utterly
worn and exhausted, and that he must keep up his strength.  Her
husband, therefore, took her place by Victor's bedside in readiness
to hold him down should he try to get up in his ravings, while
the good woman ladled out a basin of the broth and placed it with
a piece of bread and some wine on the table. Harry forced himself
to drink it, and when he rose from the table he already felt the
benefit of the meal.

"Thank you very much," he said. "I feel stronger now; but how I
am to tell the story I do not know. But I must make quite certain
before I go to these poor girls that their parents were killed.
Three or four were spared at the Abbaye. Possibly it may have been
the same thing at the Bicetre."

So Harry went back and waited outside the prison until the bloody
work was over; but found on questioning those who came out when
all was done that the thirst for blood had increased with killing,
and that all the prisoners found in the Bicetre had been put to
death.

"Ma foi!" the man whom he was speaking to said; "but these accursed
aristocrats have courage. Men and women were alike; there was not
one of them but faced the judges bravely and went to their death
as calmly as if to dinner. There was a marquis and his wife--the
Marquis de St. Caux they called him.  They brought them out together.
They were asked whether they had anything to say why they should
not be punished for their crimes against France. The marquis laughed
aloud.

"'Crimes!' he said. 'Do you think a Marquis de St. Caux is going
to plead for his life to a band of murderers and assassins? Come,
my love.'

"He just gave her one kiss, and then took her hand as if they were
going to walk a minuet together, and then led her down between the
lines of guards with his head erect and a smile of scorn on his
face. She did not smile, but her step never faltered. I watched
her closely. She was very pale, and she did not look proud, but
she walked as calmly and steadily as her husband till they reached
the door where the pikemen were awaiting them, and then it was
over in a minute, and they died without a cry or a groan. They are
wretches, the aristocrats. They have fattened on the life-blood of
the people; but they know how to die, these people."

Without a word Harry turned away. He had told himself there was no
hope; but he knew by the bitter pang he felt now that he had hoped
to the last. Then he walked slowly away to tell the news.

There were comparatively few people about the streets, and these
all of the lower order. Every shop was closed. Men with scared faces
stood at some of the doors to gather the news from passers-by, and
pale women looked timidly from the upper windows. When he reached
the house he could not summon courage to enter it, but stood for a
long time outside, until at last he saw Louise Moulin put her head
from the window. He succeeded in catching her eye, and placing his
finger on his lips signed to her to come down. A minute later she
appeared at the door.

"Is it all true, Monsieur Sandwith? They say they are murdering
the prisoners. Surely it must be false! They could never do such
a thing!"

"It is true, Louise. I have seen it myself. I went with a disguise
to try and rescue our dear lady, even if I could not save the
marquis; but I could not get to her--the wretches have murdered
them both."

"Oh, my dear lady!" the old woman cried, bursting into tears.  "The
pretty babe I nursed. To think of her murdered; and the poor young
things upstairs--what shall I do!--what shall I do, Monsieur
Sandwith!"

"You must break it to them, Louise. Do they know how great the
danger is?"

"No. I have kept it from them. They can see from the window that
something unusual is going on; everyone can see that. But I told
them it was only that the Prussians were advancing. They are
anxious--very anxious--but they are quite unprepared for this."

"Break it gradually, Louise. Tell them first that there are rumours
that the prisons have been attacked. Come down again presently as
if to get more news, and then tell them that there are reports that
the prisoners have been massacred, and then at last tell them all
the truth."

"But will you not come up, Monsieur Sandwith--they trust you so
much? Your presence will be a support to them."

"I could do nothing now," Harry said sadly. "God only can console
them. They had best be by themselves for awhile. I will come in this
evening. The first burst of grief will be over then, and my talk
may aid them to rouse themselves. Oh, if we had but tried to get
them out of prison sooner. And yet who could have foreseen that here
in Paris thousands of innocent prisoners, men and women, would be
murdered in cold blood!"

Finding that she could not persuade Harry to enter, Louise turned
to perform her painful duty; while Harry, thoroughly exhausted with
the night of horrors, made his way home, and throwing himself on
the bed, fell asleep, and did not wake until evening. His first step
was to plunge his head into water, and then, after a good wash, to
prepare a meal. His sleep had restored his energy, and with brisk
steps he made his way through the streets to Louise Moulin. He
knocked with his knuckles at the outer door of her apartments. The
old nurse opened it quietly.

"Come in," she said, "and sit down. They are in their room, and
I think they have cried themselves to sleep. My heart has been
breaking all day to see them. It has been dreadful. Poor little
Virginie cried terribly, and sobbed for hours;  but it was a long
time before the others cried. Marie fainted, and when I got her
round lay still and quiet without speaking. Jeanne was worst of
all. She sat on that chair with her eyes staring open and her face
as white as if she were dead. She did not seem to hear anything I
said; but at last, when Virginie's sobs were stopping, I began to
talk to her about her mother and her pretty ways when she was a
child, and then at last Jeanne broke down, and she cried so wildly
that I was frightened, and then Marie cried too; and after a while
I persuaded them all to lie down; and as I have not heard a sound
for the last hour I hope the good God has sent them all to sleep."

"I trust so indeed, Louise. I will stay here quietly for an hour,
and then if we hear nothing I will go home, and be back again in
the morning. Sleep will do more for them than anything I can say."

At the end of an hour all was still quiet, and Harry with a somewhat
lightened heart took his departure.

At nine o'clock next morning he was again at the house. When he
entered Virginie ran to him, and throwing her arms round his neck
again burst into a passion of tears. Harry felt that this was the
best thing that could have happened, for the others were occupied
for some time in trying to soothe her, crying quietly to themselves
while they did so. At last her sobs became less violent.

"And now, Harry," Marie said, turning to him, "will you tell us
all about it?"

"I will tell you only that your dear father and mother died, as
you might be sure they would, calmly and fearlessly, and that they
suffered but little. More than that I cannot tell you now. Some day
farther on, when you can bear it, I will tell you of the events of
the last forty-eight hours. At present I myself dare not think of
it, and it would harm you to know it.

"Do not, I pray you, ask me any questions now. We must think of
the future. Fortunately you passed unsuspected the last time they
searched the house; but it may not be so another time. You may be
sure that these human tigers will not be satisfied with the blood
they have shed, but that they will long for fresh victims. The
prisons are empty now, but they will soon be filled again. We must
therefore turn our thoughts to your making your escape from the
city. I fear that there is peril everywhere; but it must be faced.
I think it will be useless for us to try and reach the  frontier
by land. At every town and village they will be on the look-out
for fugitives, and whatever disguise you might adopt you could not
escape observation. I think, then, that we must make for the sea
and hire a fishing-boat to take us across to England.

"But we must not hurry. In the first place, we must settle all
our plans carefully and prepare our disguises; in the next place,
there will be such tremendous excitement when the news of what has
happened here is known that it would be unsafe to travel. I think
myself it will be best to wait a little until there is a lull. That
is what I want you to think over and decide.

"I do not think there is any very great danger here for the next
few days. For a little time they will be tired of slaying; and,
from what I hear, the Girondists are marked out as the next victims.
They say Danton has denounced them at the Jacobin Club. At any
rate it will be better to get everything in readiness for flight,
so that we can leave at once if we hear of any fresh measures for
a search after suspects."

Harry was pleased to find that his suggestion answered the purpose
for which he made it. The girls began to discuss the disguises
which would be required and the best route to be taken, and their
thoughts were for a time turned from the loss they had sustained.
After an hour's talk he left them greatly benefited by his visit.

For the next few days Harry spent his time for the most part by
the bedside of Victor de Gisons. The fever was still at its height,
and the doctor gave but small hopes of his recovery. Harry determined
that he would not leave Paris until the issue was decided one way
or the other, and when with the girls he discouraged any idea of
an immediate flight. This was the more easy, for the news from the
provinces showed that the situation was everywhere as bad as it
was at the capital.

The Commune had sent to all the committees acting in connection with
them in the towns throughout the country the news of the execution
of the enemies of France confined in the prisons, and had urged
that a similar step should at once be taken with reference to all
the prisoners in their hands. The order was promptly obeyed, and
throughout France massacres similar to those in Paris were at once
carried out. A carnival of murder and horror had commenced, and the
madness for blood  raged throughout the whole country. Such being
the case, Harry found it by no means difficult to dissuade the
girls from taking instant steps towards making their escape.

He was, however, in a state of great uneasiness. Many of the moderate
deputies had been seized, others had sought safety in flight, and
the search for suspected persons was carried on vigorously.  Difficult
and dangerous as it would be to endeavour to travel through France
with three girls, he would have attempted it without hesitation
rather than remain in Paris had it not been for Victor de Gisons.

One day a week after the massacres at the prisons he received
another terrible shock. He had bought a paper from one of the men
shouting them for sale in the street, and sat down in the garden of
the Tuileries to read it. A great portion of the space was filled
with lists of the enemies of the people who had been, as it was
called, executed. As these lists had formed the staple of news for
several days Harry scarce glanced at the names, his eye travelling
rapidly down the list until he gave a start and a low cry. Under
the heading of persons executed at Lille were the names of Ernest
de St. Caux, Jules de St. Caux, Pierre du Tillet--"aristocrats
arrested, August 15th, in the act of endeavouring to leave
France in disguise."

For some time Harry sat as if stunned. He had scarce given a thought
to his friends since that night they had left, the affairs of the
marquis and his wife, of their daughters, and of Victor de Gisons,
almost excluding everything else. When he thought of the boys it
had been as already in England, under the charge of du Tillet.

He had thought, that if they had been arrested on the way he
should have been sure to hear of it; and he had such confidence in
the sagacity of Monsieur du Tillet that he had looked upon it as
almost certain he would be able to lead his two charges through
any difficulty and danger which might beset them. And now he knew
that his hopes had been ill founded--that his friends had been
arrested when almost within sight of the frontier, and had been
murdered as soon as the news of the massacres in Paris had reached
Lille.

He felt crushed with the blow. A warm affection had sprung up between
him and Ernest, while from the first the younger boy had attached
himself to him; and now they were dead, and the girls were alone
in the world, save for himself and the poor young fellow tossing
with fever! It was true that if  his friends had reached England
in safety they could not have aided him in the task he had before
him of getting the girls away; still their deaths somehow seemed
to add to his responsibilities.

Upon one thing he determined at once, and that was, that until his
charges were safely in England they should not hear a whisper of
this new and terrible misfortune which had befallen them.

In order to afford the girls some slight change, and anxious at their
pale faces, the result of grief and of their unwonted confinement,
Louise Moulin had persuaded them to go out with her in the early
mornings when she went to the markets. The fear of detection was
small, for the girls had now become accustomed to their thick shoes
and rough dress; and indeed she thought that it would be safer to
go out, for the suspicions of her neighbours might be excited if
the girls remained secluded in the house. Harry generally met them
soon after they started, and accompanied them in their walk.

One morning he was walking with the two younger girls, while Marie
and the old nurse were together a short distance in front of them.
They had just reached the flower-market, which was generally the
main object of their walks--for the girls, having passed most
of their time in the country, were passionately fond of flowers--when
a man on horseback wearing a red sash, which showed him to be
an official of the republic, came along at a foot-pace. His eyes
fell upon Marie's face and rested there, at first with the look of
recognition, followed by a start of surprise and satisfaction. He
reined in his horse instantly, with the exclamation:

"Mademoiselle de St. Caux!"

For a moment she shrank back, her cheek paler even than before;
then recovering herself she said calmly:

"It is myself, Monsieur Lebat."

"Citizen Lebat," he corrected. "You forget, there are no titles
now--we have changed all that. It goes to my heart," he went on with
a sneer, "to be obliged to do my duty; but however unpleasant it
is, it must be done. Citizens," he said, raising his voice, "I want
two men well disposed to the state."

As to be ill disposed meant danger if not death, several men within
hearing at once came forward.

"This female citizen is an aristocrat in disguise," he went on,
pointing to Marie; "in virtue of my office as deputy of Dijon and
member of the Committee of Public Safety, I arrest her and give
her into your charge. Where is the person who was with her? Seize
her also on a charge of harbouring an enemy of the state!"

But Louise was gone. The moment Lebat had looked round in search
of assistance Marie had whispered in Louise's ear: "Fly, Louise,
for the sake of the children; if you are arrested they are lost!"

Had she herself been alone concerned, the old woman would have stood
by Marie and shared her fate; but the words "for the sake of the
children" decided her, and she had instantly slipped away among
the crowd, whose attention had been called by Lebat's first words,
and dived into a small shop, where she at once began to bargain
for some eggs.

"Where is the woman?" Lebat repeated angrily.

"What is she like?" one of the bystanders asked.

But Lebat could give no description whatever of her. He had noticed
that Marie was speaking to some one when he first caught sight of
her face; but he had noticed nothing more, and did not know whether
the woman was young or old.

"I can't tell you," he said in a tone of vexation. "Never mind; we
shall find her later on. This capture is the most important."

So saying he set out, with Marie walking beside him, with a guard
on either hand. In the next street he came on a party of four of
the armed soldiers of the Commune, and ordered them to take the
place of those he had first charged with the duty, and directed
them to proceed with him to the Maine.

Marie was taken at once before the committee sitting en permanence
