
3. Willie tries to make his bubble do the same. This time it comes down on
the cat's face, and makes her sneeze.

4. "She would rather wash her face without soap," says Harry. "Now let us
see who can make the biggest bubble."

5. "Mine is the biggest," says Robert. "See how high it floats in the air!
I can see--ah! it has burst."

6. "I can see the house and the trees and the sky in mine," says Willie;
"and such beautiful colors."

7.  "How many, Willie?"

8. "Red, one; blue, two; there--they are all out. Let us try again."

are in the rainbow."

WILLIE'S LETTER.
[Illustration: Script Exercise:

New York, Dec. 10, 1878.
Dear Santa Claus:
Papa is going to give
me a Christmas tree, and he
says that you will put nice
things on it if I ask you. I would
like a gun that will shoot, and
a rubber ball that I can throw
hard, and that will not break
Mamma's windows or the big
glass in the parlor.
Now, please don't forget to come.
I live on Fourth St., number ten.
I will go to bed at eight o'clock,
and shut my eyes tight.
I will not look, indeed I won't.
                 Your little boy,
                 Willie.

The Little Star

1. Twinkle, twinkle, little star;
   How I wonder what you are,
   Up above the world so high,
   Like a diamond in the sky!

2. When the blazing sun is set,
   And the grass with dew is wet,
   Then you show your little light;
   Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

3. Then, if I wore in the dark,
   I would thank you for your spark.
   I could not see which way to go,
   If you did not twinkle so.

4. And when I am sound asleep,
   Oft you through my window peep;
   For you never shut your eye,
   Till the sun is in the sky.

TWO DOGS.

1. James White has two dogs. One is a Newfoundland dog, and the other is a
Scotch terrier.

2. The Newfoundland is a large, noble fellow. He is black, with a white
spot, and with long, shaggy hair. His name is Sport.

3. Sport is a good watchdog, and a kind playfellow. Every night he guards
the house while James and his father are asleep.

4. In the daytime, James often uses Sport for his horse. He has a little
wagon, and a set of small harness which just fits the dog.

5. He hitches Sport to this wagon, and drives over the country. In this
way, he can go almost as fast as his father with the old family horse.

6. The name of James's Scotch terrier is Dodger. He is called Dodger
because he jumps about so friskily. He is up on a chair, under the table,
behind the door, down cellar, and out in the yard,--all in a minute.

7. Dodger has very bright eyes, and he does many funny things. He likes to
put his paws up on the crib, and watch the baby.

8. The other day he took baby's red stocking, and had great fun with it;
but he spoiled it in his play, and James had to scold him.

9. Everyone likes to see James White with his two dogs. They always seem
very happy together.

AFRAID IN THE DARK.

1.  "Willie, will you run upstairs, and get my needle book from the
bureau?"

2.  But Willie did not stir. "Willie!" said mamma. She thought he had not
heard.

3.  "I'm afraid," said Willie.

4.  "Afraid of what?"

5.  "It's dark up there."

6.  "What is the dark?" asked mamma. "See! It is nothing but a shadow."
And she held her hand between the lamp and the workbasket on the table.

[Illustration: Mother, seated in rocking chair, kerosene lamp on table,
boy standing, examining his shadow on the wall.]

7. "Now it is dark in the basket; but as soon as I take my hand away, it
is light."

8. "Come and stand between the lamp and the wall, Willie. See! There is
your shadow on the wall. Can your shadow hurt you?"

9. "Oh no, mamma! I am sure it can not hurt me."

10. "Well, the dark is only a big shadow over everything."

11. "What makes the big shadow, mamma?"

12. "I will tell you all about that, Willie, when you are a little older.
But now, I wish you would find me a brave boy who is not afraid of
shadows, to run upstairs and get my needlebook."

13. "I am bravo, mamma. I will go. --Here it is."

14. "Thank you, my brave little man. You see the dark didn't hurt you."

Beautiful faces are they that wear
The light of a pleasant spirit there;
Beautiful hands are they that do
Deeds that are noble good and true;
Beautiful feet are they that go
Swiftly to lighten another's woe.

BABY BYE.

1. Baby Bye,
   Here's a fly;
   We will watch him, you and I.
   How he crawls
   Up the walls,
   Yet he never falls!
   I believe with six such legs
   You and I could walk on eggs.
   There he goes
   On his toes,
   Tickling Baby's nose.

2. Spots of red
   Dot his head;
   Rainbows on his back are spread;
   That small speck
   Is his neck;
   See him nod and beck!
   I can show you, if you choose,
   Where to look to find his shoes,
   Three small pairs,
   Made of hairs;
   These he always wears.

3. Flies can see
   More than we;
   So how bright their eyes must be!
   Little fly,
   Ope your eye;
   Spiders are near by.
   For a secret I can tell,
   Spiders never use flies well;
   Then away,
   Do not stay.
   Little fly, good day.

PUSS AND HER KITTENS.

1. Puss, with her three kittens, had lived in the coal cellar; but one day
she thought she would carry them to the attic.

2. The servant thought that was not the proper place for them; so she
carried them back to the cellar.

3. Puss was certain that she wanted them in the attic; so she carried them
there again and again, five, six, seven, --yes, a dozen times; for each
time the servant took them back to the cellar.

4. Poor puss was nearly tired out, and could carry them no longer.

5. Suddenly she went away. Where do you think she went?

6. She was gone a long time. When she returned, she had a strange cat with
her that we had never seen before.

7. She seemed to tell him all about her great trouble, and he listened to
her story.

8. Then the strange cat took the little kittens, one by one, and carried
them to the attic. After this he went away, and we have never seen him
since.

9. The servant then left the kittens in the attic, for she saw how anxious
puss was to have them stay there.

10. Was not the strange cat kind to puss? This lesson should teach
children to be ever ready to help one another.

KITTY AND MOUSIE.

1. Once there was a little kitty,
     White as the snow;
   In a barn he used to frolic,
     Long time ago.

2. In the barn a little mousie
     Ran to and fro;
   For she heard the little kitty,
     Long time ago.

3. Two black eyes had little kitty,
     Black as a crow;
   And they spied the little mousie,
     Long time ago.

4. Four soft paws had little kitty,
     Paws soft as snow;
   And they caught the little mousie,
     Long time ago.

5. Nine pearl teeth had little kitty,
     All in a row;
   And they bit the little mousie,
     Long time ago.

AT WORK.

1. A little play does not harm any one, but does much good. After play, we
should be glad to work.

2. I knew a boy who liked a good game very much. He could run, swim, jump,
and play ball; and was always merry when out of school.

3. But he knew that time is not all for play; that our minutes, hours, and
days are very precious.

4. At the end of his play, he would go home. After he had washed his face
and hands, and brushed his hair, he would help his mother, or read in his
book, or write upon his slate.

5. He used to say, "One thing at a time." When he had done with work, he
would play; but he did not try to play and to work at the same time.

WHAT A BIRD TAUGHT.

1. Why do you come to my apple tree,
     Little bird so gray?
   Twit-twit, twit-twit, twit-twit-twee!
     That was all he would say.

2. Why do you lock your rosy feet
     So closely round the spray?
   Twit-twit, twit-twit, twit-tweet!
     That was all he would say.

3. Why on the topmost bough do you get,
     Little bird so gray?
   Twit-twit-twee! twit-twit-twit!
     That was all he would say.
