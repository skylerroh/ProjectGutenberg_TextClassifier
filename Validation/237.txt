Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
the official publication date.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net
http://promo.net/pg


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

PREFACE

vi:1    To those leaning on the sustaining infinite, to-day is
        big with blessings. The wakeful shepherd beholds
vi:3    the first faint morning beams, ere cometh the full radiance
        of a risen day. So shone the pale star to the prophet-
        shepherds; yet it traversed the night, and came where, in
vi:6    cradled obscurity, lay the Bethlehem babe, the human
        herald of Christ, Truth, who would make plain to be-
        nighted understanding the way of salvation through Christ
vi:9    Jesus, till across a night of error should dawn the morn-
        ing beams and shine the guiding star of being. The Wise-
        men were led to behold and to follow this daystar of
vi:12   divine Science, lighting the way to eternal harmony.

        The time for thinkers has come. Truth, independent
        of doctrines and time-honored systems, knocks at the
vi:15   portal of humanity. Contentment with the past and
        the cold conventionality of materialism are crumbling
        away. Ignorance of God is no longer the stepping-
vi:18   stone to faith. The only guarantee of obedience is a
        right apprehension of Him whom to know aright is
        Life eternal. Though empires fall, "the Lord shall
vi:21   reign forever."

        A book introduces new thoughts, but it cannot make
        them speedily understood. It is the task of the sturdy
vi:24   pioneer to hew the tall oak and to cut the rough
        granite. Future ages must declare what the pioneer
        has accomplished.

vi:27   Since the author's discovery of the might of Truth in
vii:1   the treatment of disease as well as of sin, her system has
        been fully tested and has not been found wanting; but
vii:3   to reach the heights of Christian Science, man must live
        in obedience to its divine Principle. To develop the full
        might of this Science, the discords of corporeal sense
vii:6   must yield to the harmony of spiritual sense, even as the
        science of music corrects false tones and gives sweet con-
        cord to sound.

vii:9   Theology and physics teach that both Spirit and
        matter are real and good, whereas the fact is that
        Spirit is good and real, and matter is Spirit's oppo-
vii:12  site. The question, What is Truth, is answered by
        demonstration, by healing both disease and sin; and
        this demonstration shows that Christian healing con-
vii:15  fers the most health and makes the best men. On this
        basis Christian Science will have a fair fight. Sickness
        has been combated for centuries by doctors using ma-
vii:18  terial remedies; but the question arises, Is there less
        sickness because of these practitioners? A vigorous
        "No" is the response deducible from two connate
vii:21  facts, - the reputed longevity of the Antediluvians,
        and the rapid multiplication and increased violence of
        diseases since the flood.

vii:24  In the author's work, RETROSPECTION AND INTROSPEC-
        TION, may be found a biographical sketch, narrating
        experiences which led her, in the year 1866, to the dis-
vii:27  covery of the system that she denominated Christian
        Science. As early as 1862 she began to write down and
        give to friends the results of her Scriptural study, for
vii:30  the Bible was her sole teacher; but these compositions
        were crude, the first steps of a child in the newly dis-
        covered world of Spirit.

ix:1    She also began to jot down her thoughts on the
        main subject, but these jottings were only infantile
ix:3    lispings of Truth. A child drinks in the outward world
        through the eyes and rejoices in the draught. He is
        as sure of the world's existence as he is of his own; yet
ix:6    he cannot describe the world. He finds a few words,
        and with these he stammeringly attempts to convey his
        feeling. Later, the tongue voices the more definite
ix:9    thought, though still imperfectly.

        So was it with the author. As a certain poet says of
        himself, she "lisped in numbers, for the numbers
ix:12   came." Certain essays written at that early date are
        still in circulation among her first pupils; but they are
        feeble attempts to state the Principle and practice of
ix:15   Christian healing, and are not complete nor satisfac-
        tory expositions of Truth. To-day, though rejoicing
        in some progress, she still finds herself a willing dis-
ix:18   ciple at the heavenly gate, waiting for the Mind of
        Christ.

        Her first pamphlet on Christian Science was copy-
ix:21   righted in 1870; but it did not appear in print until
        1876, as she had learned that this Science must be
        1876, as she had learned that this Science must be
        demonstrated by healing, before a work on the subject
ix:24   could be profitably studied. From 1867 until 1875,
        copies were, however, in friendly circulation.

        Before writing this work, SCIENCE AND HEALTH, she
ix:27   made copious notes of Scriptural exposition, which
        have never been published. This was during the years
        1867 and 1868. These efforts show her comparative
ix:30   ignorance of the stupendous Life-problem up to that
        time, and the degrees by which she came at length
        to its solution; but she values them as a parent
x:1     may treasure the memorials of a child's growth, and
        she would not have them changed.

x:3     The first edition of SCIENCE AND HEALTH was pub-
        lished in 1875. Various books on mental healing have
        since been issued, most of them incorrect in theory
x:6     and filled with plagiarisms from SCIENCE AND HEALTH.
        They regard the human mind as a healing agent,
        whereas this mind is not a factor in the Principle of
x:9     Christian Science. A few books, however, which are
        based on this book, are useful.

        The author has not compromised conscience to suit
x:12    the general drift of thought, but has bluntly and hon-
        estly given the text of Truth. She has made no effort
        to embellish, elaborate, or treat in full detail so in-
x:15    finite a theme. By thousands of well-authenticated
        cases of healing, she and her students have proved the
        worth of her teachings. These cases for the most part
x:18    have been abandoned as hopeless by regular medical
        attendants. Few invalids will turn to God till all
        physical supports have failed, because there is so little
x:21    faith in His disposition and power to heal disease.

        The divine Principle of healing is proved in the
        personal experience of any sincere seeker of Truth. Its
x:24    purpose is good, and its practice is safer and more po-
        tent than that of any other sanitary method. The un-
        biased Christian thought is soonest touched by Truth,
x:27    and convinced of it. Only those quarrel with her
        method who do not understand her meaning, or dis-
        cerning the truth, come not to the light lest their
x:30    works be reproved. No intellectual proficiency is req-
        uisite in the learner, but sound morals are most de-
        sirable.

xi:1    Many imagine that the phenomena of physical heal-
        ing in Christian Science present only a phase of the
xi:3    action of the human mind, which action in some unex-
        plained way results in the cure of disease. On the con-
        trary, Christian Science rationally explains that all
xi:6    other pathological methods are the fruits of human
        faith in matter, faith in the workings, not of Spirit,
        but of the fleshly mind which must yield to Science.

xi:9    The physical healing of Christian Science results
        now, as in Jesus' time, from the operation of divine
        Principle, before which sin and disease lose their real-
xi:12   ity in human consciousness and disappear as naturally
        and as necessarily as darkness gives place to light and
        sin to reformation. Now, as then, these mighty works
xi:15   are not supernatural, but supremely natural. They are
        the sign of Immanuel, or "God with us," a divine
        influence ever present in human consciousness and re-
xi:18   peating itself, coming now as was promised aforetime,

             To preach deliverance to the captives [of sense],
             And recovering of sight to the blind,
xi:21        To set at liberty them that are bruised.

        When God called the author to proclaim His Gospel
        to this age, there came also the charge to plant and
xi:24   water His vineyard.

        The first school of Christian Science Mind-healing
        was started by the author with only one student in
xi:27   Lynn, Massachusetts, about the year 1867. In 1881,
        she opened the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in
        Boston, under the seal of the Commonwealth, a law
xi:30   relative to colleges having been passed, which enabled
        her to get this institution chartered for medical pur-
xii:1   poses. No charters were granted to Christian Scien-
        tists for such institutions after 1883, and up to that
xii:3   date, hers was the only College of this character which
        had been established in the United States, where
        Christian Science was first introduced.

xii:6   During seven years over four thousand students
        were taught by the author in this College. Meanwhile
        she was pastor of the first established Church of
xii:9   Christ, Scientist; President of the first Christian Sci-
        entist Association, convening monthly; publisher of
        her own works; and (for a portion of this time) sole
xii:12  editor and publisher of the Christian Science Journal,
        the first periodical issued by Christian Scientists. She
        closed her College, October 29, 1889, in the height of
xii:15  its prosperity with a deep-lying conviction that the
        next two years of her life should be given to the prep-
        aration of the revision of SCIENCE AND HEALTH, which

        as its President, reopened the College in 1899 as auxil-

        In the spirit of Christ's charity, as one who "hopeth
xii:24  all things, endureth all things," and is joyful to bear
        consolation to the sorrowing and healing to the sick,
        she commits these pages to honest seekers for Truth.

        CHAPTER I - PRAYER

        For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this
        mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and
        shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those
        things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have
        whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things
        soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them,
        and ye shall have them.
        Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask
        Him. - CHRIST JESUS.

1:1     THE prayer that reforms the sinner and heals the
        sick is an absolute faith that all things are
1:3     possible to God,- a spiritual understanding of Him,
        an unselfed love. Regardless of what another may say
        or think on this subject, I speak from experience.
1:6     Prayer, watching, and working, combined with self-im-
        molation, are God's gracious means for accomplishing
        whatever has been successfully done for the Christian-
1:9     ization and health of mankind.

        Thoughts unspoken are not unknown to the divine
        Mind. Desire is prayer; and no loss can occur from
1:12    trusting God with our desires, that they may be
        moulded and exalted before they take form in words
        and in deeds.

                              Right motives

2:1     What are the motives for prayer? Do we pray to
        make ourselves better or to benefit those who hear us,
2:3     to enlighten the infinite or to be heard of
        men? Are we benefited by praying? Yes,
        the desire which goes forth hungering after righteous-
2:6     ness is blessed of our Father, and it does not return
        unto us void.

                           Deity unchangeable

        God is not moved by the breath of praise to do more
2:9     than He has already done, nor can the infinite do less
        than bestow all good, since He is unchang-
        ing wisdom and Love. We can do more for
2:12    ourselves by humble fervent petitions, but the All-lov-
        ing does not grant them simply on the ground of lip-
        service, for He already knows all.

2:15    Prayer cannot change the Science of being, but it
        tends to bring us into harmony with it. Goodness at-
        tains the demonstration of Truth. A request that
2:18    God will save us is not all that is required. The mere
        habit of pleading with the divine Mind, as one pleads
        with a human being, perpetuates the belief in God as
2:21    humanly circumscribed,- an error which impedes spirit-
        ual growth.

                             God's standard

        God is Love. Can we ask Him to be more? God is
2:24    intelligence. Can we inform the infinite Mind of any-
        thing He does not already comprehend?
        Do we expect to change perfection? Shall
2:27    we plead for more at the open fount, which is pour-
        ing forth more than we accept? The unspoken desire
        does bring us nearer the source of all existence and
2:30    blessedness.

        Asking God to /be/ God is a vain repetition. God is
        "the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever;" and
3:1     He who is immutably right will do right without being
        reminded of His province. The wisdom of man is not
3:3     sufficient to warrant him in advising God.

                        The spiritual mathematics

        Who would stand before a blackboard, and pray the
        principle of mathematics to solve the problem? The
3:6     rule is already established, and it is our
        task to work out the solution. Shall we
        ask the divine Principle of all goodness to do His own
3:9     work? His work is done, and we have only to avail
        ourselves of God's rule in order to receive His bless-
        ing, which enables us to work out our own salvation.

3:12    The Divine Being must be reflected by man, - else
        man is not the image and likeness of the patient,
        tender, and true, the One "altogether lovely;" but to
3:15    understand God is the work of eternity, and demands
        absolute consecration of thought, energy, and desire.

                          Prayerful ingratitude

        How empty are our conceptions of Deity! We admit
3:18    theoretically that God is good, omnipotent, omni-
        present, infinite, and then we try to give
        information to this infinite Mind. We plead
3:21    for unmerited pardon and for a liberal outpouring of
        benefactions. Are we really grateful for the good
        already received? Then we shall avail ourselves of the
3:24    blessings we have, and thus be fitted to receive more.
        Gratitude is much more than a verbal expression of
        thanks. Action expresses more gratitude than speech.

3:27    If we are ungrateful for Life, Truth, and Love, and
        yet return thanks to God for all blessings, we are in-
        sincere and incur the sharp censure our Master pro-
3:30    nounces on hypocrites. In such a case, the only
        acceptable prayer is to put the finger on the lips and
        remember our blessings. While the heart is far from
4:1     divine Truth and Love, we cannot conceal the ingrati-
        tude of barren lives.

                          Efficacious petitions

4:3     What we most need is the prayer of fervent desire
        for growth in grace, expressed in patience, meekness,
        love, and good deeds. To keep the com-
4:6     mandments of our Master and follow his
        example, is our proper debt to him and the only
        worthy evidence of our gratitude for all that he has
4:9     done. Outward worship is not of itself sufficient to
        express loyal and heartfelt gratitude, since he has
        said: "If ye love me, keep my commandments."

4:12    The habitual struggle to be always good is unceas-
        ing prayer. Its motives are made manifest in the
        blessings they bring,- blessings which, even if not
4:15    acknowledged in audible words, attest our worthiness
        to be partakers of Love.

                         Watchfulness requisite

        Simply asking that we may love God will never
4:18    make us love Him; but the longing to be better
        and holier, expressed in daily watchful-
        ness and in striving to assimilate more of
4:21    the divine character, will mould and fashion us
        anew, until we awake in His likeness. We reach the
        Science of Christianity through demonstration of the
4:24    divine nature; but in this wicked world goodness
        will "be evil spoken of," and patience must bring
        experience.

                           Veritable devotion

4:27    Audible prayer can never do the works of spiritual
        understanding, which regenerates; but silent prayer,
        watchfulness, and devout obedience enable
4:30    us to follow Jesus' example. Long prayers,
        superstition, and creeds clip the strong pinions of love,
        and clothe religion in human forms. Whatever mate-
5:1     rializes worship hinders man's spiritual growth and keeps
        him from demonstrating his power over error.

                         Sorrow and reformation

5:3     Sorrow for wrong-doing is but one step towards reform
        and the very easiest step. The next and great step re-
        quired by wisdom is the test of our sincerity,
5:6     - namely, reformation. To this end we are
        placed under the stress of circumstances. Temptation
        bids us repeat the offence, and woe comes in return for
5:9     what is done. So it will ever be, till we learn that there
        is no discount in the law of justice and that we must pay
        "the uttermost farthing." The measure ye mete "shall
5:12    be measured to you again," and it will be full "and run-
        ning over."

        Saints and sinners get their full award, but not always
5:15    in this world. The followers of Christ drank his cup.
        Ingratitude and persecution filled it to the brim; but God
        pours the riches of His love into the understanding and
5:18    affections, giving us strength according to our day. Sin-
        ners flourish "like a green bay tree;" but, looking farther,
        the Psalmist could see their end, - the destruction of sin
5:21    through suffering.

                        Cancellation of human sin

        Prayer is not to be used as a confessional to cancel sin.
        Such an error would impede true religion. Sin is forgiven
5:24    only as it is destroyed by Christ, - Truth and
        Life. If prayer nourishes the belief that sin is
        cancelled, and that man is made better merely by praying,
5:27    prayer is an evil. He grows worse who continues in sin
        because he fancies himself forgiven.

                           Diabolism destroyed

        An apostle says that the Son of God [Christ] came to
5:30    "destroy the /works/ of the devil." We should
        follow our divine Exemplar, and seek the de-
        struction of all evil works, error and disease included.
6:1     We cannot escape the penalty due for sin. The Scrip-
        tures say, that if we deny Christ, " he also will deny us."

                          Pardon and amendment

6:3     Divine Love corrects and governs man. Men may
        pardon, but this divine Principle alone reforms the
        sinner. God is not separate from the wis-
6:6     dom He bestows. The talents He gives we
        must improve. Calling on Him to forgive our work
        badly done or left undone, implies the vain supposition
6:9     that we have nothing to do but to ask pardon, and
        that afterwards we shall be free to repeat the offence.

        To cause suffering as the result of sin, is the means
6:12    of destroying sin. Every supposed pleasure in sin
        will furnish more than its equivalent of pain, until be-
        lief in material life and sin is destroyed. To reach
6:15    heaven, the harmony of being, we must understand
        the divine Principle of being.

                        Mercy without partiality

        "God is Love." More than this we cannot ask,
6:18    higher we cannot look, farther we cannot go. To
        suppose that God forgives or punishes sin
        according as His mercy is sought or un-
6:21    sought, is to misunderstand Love and to make prayer
        the safety-valve for wrong-doing.

                             Divine severity

        Jesus uncovered and rebuked sin before he cast it
6:24    out. Of a sick woman he said that Satan had bound
        her, and to Peter he said, "Thou art an of-
        fence unto me." He came teaching and
6:27    showing men how to destroy sin, sickness, and death.
        He said of the fruitless tree, "[It] is hewn down."

        It is believed by many that a certain magistrate,
6:30    who lived in the time of Jesus, left this record: "His
        rebuke is fearful." The strong language of our Mas-
        ter confirms this description.

7:1     The only civil sentence which he had for error was,
        "Get thee behind me, Satan." Still stronger evidence
7:3     that Jesus' reproof was pointed and pungent is found
        in his own words,- showing the necessity for such
        forcible utterance, when he cast out devils and healed
7:6     the sick and sinning. The relinquishment of error de-
        prives material sense of its false claims.

                             Audible praying

        Audible prayer is impressive; it gives momentary
7:9     solemnity and elevation to thought. But does it pro-
        duce any lasting benefit? Looking deeply
        into these things, we find that "a zeal . . .
7:12    not according to knowledge" gives occasion for reac-
        tion unfavorable to spiritual growth, sober resolve, and
        wholesome perception of God's requirements. The mo-
7:15    tives for verbal prayer may embrace too much love of
        applause to induce or encourage Christian sentiment.

                          Emotional utterances

        Physical sensation, not Soul, produces material ec-
7:18    stasy and emotion. If spiritual sense always guided
        men, there would grow out of ecstatic mo-
        ments a higher experience and a better life
7:21    with more devout self-abnegation and purity. A self-
        satisfied ventilation of fervent sentiments never makes
        a Christian. God is not influenced by man. The "di-
7:24    vine ear" is not an auditory nerve. It is the all-hearing
        and all-knowing Mind, to whom each need of man is
        always known and by whom it will be supplied.

                       Danger from audible prayer

7:27    The danger from prayer is that it may lead us into temp-
        tation. By it we may become involuntary hypocrites, ut-
        tering desires which are not real and consoling
