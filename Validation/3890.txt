FOREVER

By NED LANG


 _Of all the irksome, frustrating,
 maddening discoveries--was there
 no way of keeping it discovered?_


Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS


With so much at stake, Charles Dennison should not have been careless.
An inventor cannot afford carelessness, particularly when his invention
is extremely valuable and obviously patentable. There are too many
grasping hands ready to seize what belongs to someone else, too many men
who feast upon the creativity of the innocent.

A touch of paranoia would have served Dennison well; but he was lacking
in that vital characteristic of inventors. And he didn't even realize
the full extent of his carelessness until a bullet, fired from a
silenced weapon, chipped a granite wall not three inches from his head.

Then he knew. But by then it was too late.

Charles Dennison had been left a more than adequate income by his

He would then return gratefully to his seclusion. He was a bachelor and
seemed destined to remain that way.

Not long after his fortieth birthday, Dennison stumbled across an
intriguing clue which led him into a different branch of biology. He
pursued his clue, developed it, extended it slowly into a hypothesis.
After three more years, a lucky accident put the final proofs into his
hands.

He had invented a most effective longevity drug. It was not proof
against violence; aside from that, however, it could fairly be called an
immortality serum.

Now was the time for caution. But years of seclusion had made Dennison
