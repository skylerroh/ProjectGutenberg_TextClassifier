PETER RABBIT BECOMES ACQUAINTED WITH MRS. QUACK


Make a new acquaintance every time you can;   You'll find it
interesting and a very helpful plan.

It means more knowledge. You cannot meet any one without learning
something from him if you keep your ears open and your eyes open.
Every one is at least a little different from every one else, and
the more people you know, the more you may learn. Peter Rabbit
knows this, and that is one reason he always is so eager to find out
about other people. He had left Jimmy Skunk and Bobby Coon in the
Green Forest and had headed for the Smiling Pool to see if Grandfather
Frog was awake yet. He had no idea of meeting a stranger there, and
so you can imagine just how surprised he was when he got in sight
of the Smiling Pool to see some one whom he never had seen before
swimming about there. He knew right away who it was. He knew that
it was Mrs. Quack the Duck, because he had often heard about her. And
then, too, it was very clear from her looks that she was a cousin
of the ducks he had seen in Farmer Brown's dooryard. The difference
was that while they were big and white and stupid-looking, Mrs.
Quack was smaller, brown, very trim, and looked anything but stupid.

Peter was so surprised to see her in the Smiling Pool that he almost
forgot to be polite. I am afraid he stared in a very impolite way
as he hurried to the edge of the bank. "I suppose," said Peter,
"that you are Mrs. Quack, but I never expected to see you unless I
should go over to the Big River, and that is a place I never have
visited and hardly expect to because it is too far from the dear
Old Briar-patch. You are Mrs. Quack, aren't you?"

"Yes," replied Mrs. Quack, "and you must be Peter Rabbit. I've heard
of you very often." All the time Mrs. Quack was swimming back and
forth and in little circles in the most uneasy way.

"I hope you've heard nothing but good of me," replied Peter.

Mrs. Quack stopped her uneasy swimming for a minute and almost
smiled as she looked at Peter, "The worst I have heard is that you
are very curious about other people's affairs," said she.

Peter looked a wee, wee bit foolish, and then he laughed right out.
"I guess that is true enough," said he. "I like to learn all I can,
and how can I learn without being curious? I'm curious right now.
I'm wondering what brings you to the Smiling Pool when you never
have been here before. It is the last place in the world I ever
expected to find you."

"That's why I'm here," replied Mrs. Quack. "I hope others feel the
same way. I came here because I just HAD to find some place where
people wouldn't expect to find me and so wouldn't come looking for
me. Little Joe Otter saw me yesterday on the Big River and told me
of this place, and so, because I just had to go somewhere, I came
here."

Peter's eyes opened very wide with surprise. "Why," he exclaimed,
"I should think you would be perfectly safe on the Big River! I
don't see how any harm can possibly come to you out there."

The words were no sooner out of Peter's mouth than a faint bang
sounded from way off towards the Big River. Mrs. Quack gave a great
start and half lifted her wings as if to fly. But she thought better
of it, and then Peter saw that she was trembling all over.

"Did you hear that?" she asked in a faint voice.

Peter nodded. "That was a gun, a terrible gun, but it was a long
way from here," said he.

"It was over on the Big River," said Mrs. Quack. "That's why it
isn't safe for me over there. That's why I just had to find some
other place. Oh, dear, the very sound of a gun sets me to shaking
and makes my heart feel as if it would stop beating. Are you sure
I am perfectly safe here?"

"Perfectly," spoke up Jerry Muskrat, who had been listening from
the top of the Big Rock, where he was lunching on a clam, "unless
you are not smart enough to keep out of the clutches of Reddy Fox
or Old Man Coyote or Hooty the Owl or Redtail the Hawk."

"I'm not afraid of THEM," declared Mrs. Quack. "It's those two-legged
creatures with terrible guns I'm afraid of," and she began to swim
about more uneasily than ever.




II

MRS. QUACK IS DISTRUSTFUL


Jerry Muskrat thinks there is no place in the world like the Smiling
Pool. So, for the matter of that, does Grandfather Frog and also
Spotty the Turtle. You see, they have spent their lives there and
know little about the rest of the Great World. When Mrs. Quack
explained that all she feared was that a two-legged creature with
a terrible gun might find her there, Jerry Muskrat hastened to tell
her that she had nothing to worry about on that account.

"No one hunts here now that Farmer Brown's boy has put away his
terrible gun," explained Jerry. "There was a time when he used to
hunt here and set traps, which are worse than terrible guns, but
that was long ago, before he knew any better."

"Who is Farmer Brown's boy?" demanded Mrs. Quack, looking more
anxious than ever. "Is he one of those two-legged creatures?"

"Yes," said Peter Rabbit, who had been listening with all his ears,
"but he is the best friend we Quaddies have got. He is such a good
friend that he ought to be a Quaddy himself. Why, this last winter
he fed some of us when food was scarce, and he saved Mrs. Grouse
when she was caught in a snare, which you know is a kind of trap.
He won't let any harm come to you here, Mrs. Quack."

"I wouldn't trust him, not for one single little minute," declared
Mrs. Quack.  "I wouldn't trust one of those two-legged creatures,
not ONE. You say he fed some of you last winter, but that doesn't
mean anything good. Do you know what I've known these two-legged
creatures to do?"

"What?" demanded Peter and Jerry together.

"I've known them to scatter food where we Ducks would be sure to
