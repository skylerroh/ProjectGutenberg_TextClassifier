SYBIL, OR THE TWO NATIONS

By Benjamin Disraeli


I would inscribe these volumes to one whose noble spirit and gentle
nature ever prompt her to sympathise with the suffering; to one whose
sweet voice has often encouraged, and whose taste and judgment have ever
guided, their pages; the most severe of critics, but--a perfect Wife!

The general reader whose attention has not been specially drawn to the
subject which these volumes aim to illustrate, the Condition of
the People, might suspect that the Writer had been tempted to some
exaggeration in the scenes which he has drawn and the impressions which
he has wished to convey. He thinks it therefore due to himself to state
that he believes there is not a trait in this work for which he has not
the authority of his own observation, or the authentic evidence which
has been received by Royal Commissions and Parliamentary Committees. But
while he hopes he has alleged nothing which is not true, he has found
the absolute necessity of suppressing much that is genuine. For so
little do we know of the state of our own country that the air of
improbability that the whole truth would inevitably throw over these
pages, might deter many from their perusal.

Grosvenor-Gate, May Day, 1845.




BOOK I




Book 1 Chapter 1


"I'll take the odds against Caravan."

"In poneys?"

"Done."

And Lord Milford, a young noble, entered in his book the bet which he
had just made with Mr Latour, a grey headed member of the Jockey Club.

It was the eve of the Derby of 1837. In a vast and golden saloon, that
in its decorations would have become, and in its splendour would not
have disgraced, Versailles in the days of the grand monarch, were
assembled many whose hearts beat at the thought of the morrow, and whose
brains still laboured to control its fortunes to their advantage.

"They say that Caravan looks puffy," lisped in a low voice a young
man, lounging on the edge of a buhl table that had once belonged to a
Mortemart, and dangling a rich cane with affected indifference in order
to conceal his anxiety from all, except the person whom he addressed.

"They are taking seven to two against him freely over the way," was the
reply. "I believe it's all right."

"Do you know I dreamed last night something about Mango," continued the
gentleman with the cane, and with a look of uneasy superstition.

His companion shook his head.

"Well," continued the gentleman with the cane, "I have no opinion of
him. I gave Charles Egremont the odds against Mango this morning; he
goes with us, you know. By the bye, who is our fourth?"

"I thought of Milford," was the reply in an under tone. "What say you?"

"Milford is going with St James and Punch Hughes."

"Well, let us come into supper, and we shall see some fellow we like."

So saying, the companions, taking their course through more than one
chamber, entered an apartment of less dimensions than the principal
saloon, but not less sumptuous in its general appearance. The gleaming
lustres poured a flood of soft yet brilliant light over a plateau
glittering with gold plate, and fragrant with exotics embedded in vases
of rare porcelain. The seats on each side of the table were occupied by
persons consuming, with a heedless air, delicacies for which they had no
appetite; while the conversation in general consisted of flying phrases
referring to the impending event of the great day that had already
dawned.

"Come from Lady St Julian's, Fitz?" said a youth of very tender years,
and whose fair visage was as downy and as blooming as the peach from
which with a languid air he withdrew his lips to make this inquiry of
the gentleman with the cane.

"Yes; why were not you there?"

"I never go anywhere," replied the melancholy Cupid, "everything bores
me so."

"Well, will you go to Epsom with us to-morrow, Alfred?" said Lord
Fitzheron. "I take Berners and Charles Egremont, and with you our party
will be perfect."

"I feel so cursed blase!" exclaimed the boy in a tone of elegant
anguish.

"It will give you a fillip, Alfred," said Mr Berners; "do you all the
good in the world."

"Nothing can do me good," said Alfred, throwing away his almost untasted
peach, "I should be quite content if anything could do me harm. Waiter,
bring me a tumbler of Badminton."

"And bring me one too," sighed out Lord Eugene De Vere, who was a
year older than Alfred Mountchesney, his companion and brother in
listlessness. Both had exhausted life in their teens, and all that
remained for them was to mourn, amid the ruins of their reminiscences,
over the extinction of excitement.

"Well, Eugene, suppose you come with us." said Lord Fitzheron.

"I think I shall go down to Hampton Court and play tennis," said Lord
Eugene. "As it is the Derby, nobody will be there."

"And I will go with you, Eugene," said Alfred Mountchesney, "and we will
dine together afterwards at the Toy. Anything is better than dining in
this infernal London."

"Well, for my part," said Mr Berners. "I do not like your suburban
dinners. You always get something you can't eat, and cursed bad wine."

"I rather like bad wine," said Mr Mountchesney; "one gets so bored with
good wine."

"Do you want the odds against Hybiscus, Berners?" said a guardsman
looking up from his book, which he had been very intently studying.

"All I want is some supper, and as you are not using your place--"

"You shall have it. Oh! here's Milford, he will give them me."

And at this moment entered the room the young nobleman whom we have
before mentioned, accompanied by an individual who was approaching
perhaps the termination of his fifth lustre but whose general air
rather betokened even a less experienced time of life. Tall, with
a well-proportioned figure and a graceful carriage, his countenance
touched with a sensibility that at once engages the affections. Charles
Egremont was not only admired by that sex, whose approval generally
secures men enemies among their fellows, but was at the same time the
favourite of his own.

"Ah, Egremont! come and sit here," exclaimed more than one banqueter.

"I saw you waltzing with the little Bertie, old fellow," said Lord
Fitzheron, "and therefore did not stay to speak to you, as I thought we
should meet here. I am to call for you, mind."

"How shall we all feel this time to-morrow?" said Egremont, smiling.

"The happiest fellow at this moment must be Cockie Graves," said Lord
Milford. "He can have no suspense I have been looking over his book, and
I defy him, whatever happens, not to lose."

"Poor Cockie." said Mr Berners; "he has asked me to dine with him at the
Clarendon on Saturday."

"Cockie is a very good Cockie," said Lord Milford, "and Caravan is a
very good horse; and if any gentleman sportsman present wishes to give
seven to two, I will take him to any amount."

"My book is made up," said Egremont; "and I stand or fall by Caravan."

"And I."

"And I."

"And I."

"Well, mark my words," said a fourth, rather solemnly, "Rat-trap wins."

"There is not a horse except Caravan," said Lord Milford, "fit for a
borough stake."

"You used to be all for Phosphorus, Egremont," said Lord Eugene de Vere.

"Yes; but fortunately I have got out of that scrape. I owe Phip Dormer a
good turn for that. I was the third man who knew he had gone lame."

"And what are the odds against him now."

"Oh! nominal; forty to one,--what you please."

"He won't run," said Mr Berners, "John Day told me he had refused to
ride him."

"I believe Cockie Graves might win something if Phosphorus came in
first," said Lord Milford, laughing.

"How close it is to-night!" said Egremont. "Waiter, give me some Seltzer
water; and open another window; open them all."

At this moment an influx of guests intimated that the assembly at Lady
St Julian's was broken up. Many at the table rose and yielded their
places, clustering round the chimney-piece, or forming in various
groups, and discussing the great question. Several of those who had
recently entered were votaries of Rat-trap, the favourite, and quite
prepared, from all the information that had reached them, to back
their opinions valiantly. The conversation had now become general and
animated, or rather there was a medley of voices in which little was
distinguished except the names of horses and the amount of odds. In
the midst of all this, waiters glided about handing incomprehensible
mixtures bearing aristocratic names; mystical combinations of French
wines and German waters, flavoured with slices of Portugal fruits, and
cooled with lumps of American ice, compositions which immortalized the
creative genius of some high patrician name.

"By Jove! that's a flash," exclaimed Lord Milford, as a blaze of
lightning seemed to suffuse the chamber, and the beaming lustres turned
white and ghastly in the glare.

The thunder rolled over the building. There was a dead silence. Was
it going to rain? Was it going to pour? Was the storm confined to the
metropolis? Would it reach Epsom? A deluge, and the course would be a
quagmire, and strength might baffle speed.

Another flash, another explosion, the hissing noise of rain. Lord
Milford moved aside, and jealous of the eye of another, read a letter
from Chifney, and in a few minutes afterwards offered to take the odds
against Pocket Hercules. Mr Latour walked to the window, surveyed the
heavens, sighed that there was not time to send his tiger from the door
to Epsom, and get information whether the storm had reached the Surrey
hills, for to-night's operations. It was too late. So he took a rusk and
a glass of lemonade, and retired to rest with a cool head and a cooler
heart.

The storm raged, the incessant flash played as it were round the
burnished cornice of the chamber, and threw a lurid hue on the scenes
of Watteau and Boucher that sparkled in the medallions over the lofty
doors. The thunderbolts seemed to descend in clattering confusion upon
the roof. Sometimes there was a moment of dead silence, broken only by
the pattering of the rain in the street without, or the pattering of the
dice in a chamber at hand. Then horses were backed, bets made, and there
were loud and frequent calls for brimming goblets from hurrying waiters,
distracted by the lightning and deafened by the peal. It seemed a scene
and a supper where the marble guest of Juan might have been expected,
and had he arrived, he would have found probably hearts as bold and
spirits as reckless as he encountered in Andalusia.




Book 1 Chapter 2



"Will any one do anything about Hybiscus?" sang out a gentleman in the
ring at Epsom. It was full of eager groups; round the betting post a
swarming cluster, while the magic circle itself was surrounded by a
host of horsemen shouting from their saddles the odds they were ready to
receive or give, and the names of the horses they were prepared to back
or to oppose.

"Will any one do anything about Hybiscus?"

"I'll give you five to one," said a tall, stiff Saxon peer, in a white
great coat.

"No; I'll take six."

The tall, stiff peer in the white great coat mused for a moment with his
pencil at his lip, and then said, "Well, I'll give you six. What do you
say about Mango?"

"Eleven to two against Mango," called out a little humpbacked man in a
shrill voice, but with the air of one who was master of his work.

"I should like to do a little business with you, Mr Chippendale," said
Lord Milford in a coaxing tone, "but I must have six to one."

"Eleven to two, and no mistake," said this keeper of a second-rate
gaming-house, who, known by the flattering appellation of Hump
Chippendale, now turned with malignant abruptness from the heir apparent
of an English earldom.

"You shall have six to one, my Lord," said Captain Spruce, a debonair
personage with a well-turned silk hat arranged a little aside, his
coloured cravat tied with precision, his whiskers trimmed like a
quickset hedge. Spruce, who had earned his title of Captain on the
plains of Newmarket, which had witnessed for many a year his successful
exploits, had a weakness for the aristocracy, who knowing his graceful
infirmity patronized him with condescending dexterity, acknowledged his
existence in Pall Mall as well as at Tattersalls, and thus occasionally
got a point more than the betting out of him. Hump Chippendale had none
of these gentle failings; he was a democratic leg, who loved to fleece a
noble, and thought all men were born equal--a consoling creed that was a
hedge for his hump.

"Seven to four against the favourite; seven to two against Caravan;
eleven to two against Mango. What about Benedict? Will any one do
anything about Pocket Hercules? Thirty to one against Dardanelles."

"Done."

"Five and thirty ponies to one against Phosphorus," shouted a little man
vociferously and repeatedly.

"I will give forty," said Lord Milford. No answer,--nothing done.

"Forty to one!" murmured Egremont who stood against Phosphorus. A little
nervous, he said to the peer in the white great coat, "Don't you think
that Phosphorus may after all have some chance?"

"I should be cursed sorry to be deep against him," said the peer.

Egremont with a quivering lip walked away. He consulted his book; he
meditated anxiously. Should he hedge? It was scarcely worth while to mar
the symmetry of his winnings; he stood "so well" by all the favourites;
and for a horse at forty to one. No; he would trust his star, he would
not hedge.

"Mr Chippendale," whispered the peer in the white great coat, "go and
press Mr Egremont about Phosphorus. I should not be surprised if you got
a good thing."

At this moment, a huge, broad-faced, rosy-gilled fellow, with one of
those good-humoured yet cunning countenances that we meet occasionally
on the northern side of the Trent, rode up to the ring on a square cob
and dismounting entered the circle. He was a carcase butcher, famous in
Carnaby market, and the prime councillor of a distinguished nobleman for
whom privately he betted on commission. His secret service to-day was to
bet against his noble employer's own horse, and so he at once sung out,
"Twenty to one against Man-trap."

A young gentleman just launched into the world, and who, proud of his
ancient and spreading acres, was now making his first book, seeing
Man-trap marked eighteen to one on the cards, jumped eagerly at this
bargain, while Lord Fitzheron and Mr Berners who were at hand and who in
their days had found their names in the book of the carcase butcher, and
grown wise by it, interchanged a smile.

"Mr Egremont will not take," said Hump Chippendale to the peer in the
white great coat.

"You must have been too eager," said his noble friend.

The ring is up; the last odds declared; all gallop away to the Warren.
A few minutes, only a few minutes, and the event that for twelve months
has been the pivot of so much calculation, of such subtile combinations,
of such deep conspiracies, round which the thought and passion of the
sporting world have hung like eagles, will be recorded in the fleeting
tablets of the past. But what minutes! Count them by sensation and not
by calendars, and each moment is a day and the race a life. Hogarth in
a coarse and yet animated sketch has painted "Before" and "After." A
creative spirit of a higher vein might develope the simplicity of the
idea with sublimer accessories. Pompeius before Pharsalia, Harold before
Hastings, Napoleon before Waterloo, might afford some striking contrasts
to the immediate catastrophe of their fortunes. Finer still the inspired
mariner who has just discovered a new world; the sage who has revealed
a new planet; and yet the "Before" and "After" of a first-rate English
race, in the degree of its excitement, and sometimes in the tragic
emotions of its close, may vie even with these.

They are saddling the horses; Caravan looks in great condition; and a
scornful smile seems to play upon the handsome features of Pavis, as in
the becoming colours of his employer, he gracefully gallops his horse
before his admiring supporters. Egremont in the delight of an
English patrician scarcely saw Mango, and never even thought of
Phosphorus--Phosphorus, who, by the bye, was the first horse that
showed, with both his forelegs bandaged.

They are off!

As soon as they are well away, Chifney makes the running with Pocket
Hercules. Up to the Rubbing House he is leading; this is the only point
the eye can select. Higher up the hill, Caravan, Hybiscus, Benedict,
Mahometan, Phosphorus, Michel Fell, and Rat-trap are with the grey,
forming a front rank, and at the new ground the pace has told its tale,
for half a dozen are already out of the race.

The summit is gained; the tactics alter: here Pavis brings up Caravan,
with extraordinary severity,--the pace round Tattenham corner terrific;
Caravan leading, then Phosphorus a little above him, Mahometan next,
Hybiscus fourth. Rat-trap looking badly, Wisdom, Benedict and another
handy. By this time Pocket Hercules has enough, and at the road the
tailing grows at every stride. Here the favourite himself is hors de
combat, as well as Dardanelles, and a crowd of lesser celebrities.

There are now but four left in the race, and of these, two, Hybiscus
and Mahometan, are some lengths behind. Now it is neck and neck between
Caravan and Phosphorus. At the stand Caravan has decidedly the best,
but just at the post, Edwards, on Phosphorus, lifts the gallant little
horse, and with an extraordinary effort contrives to shove him in by
half a length.

"You look a little low, Charley," said Lord Fitzheron, as taking their
lunch in their drag he poured the champagne into the glass of Egremont.

"By Jove!" said Lord Milford, "Only think of Cockie Graves having gone
and done it!"




Book 1 Chapter 3



Egremont was the younger brother of an English earl, whose nobility
being of nearly three centuries' date, ranked him among our high and
ancient peers, although its origin was more memorable than illustrious.
The founder of the family had been a confidential domestic of one of the
favourites of Henry the Eighth, and had contrived to be appointed one
of the commissioners for "visiting and taking the surrenders of divers
religious houses." It came to pass that divers of these religious houses
surrendered themselves eventually to the use and benefit of honest
Baldwin Greymount. The king was touched with the activity and zeal
of his commissioner. Not one of them whose reports were so ample and
satisfactory, who could baffle a wily prior with more dexterity, or
control a proud abbot with more firmness. Nor were they well-digested
reports alone that were transmitted to the sovereign: they came
accompanied with many rare and curious articles, grateful to the taste
of one who was not only a religious reformer but a dilettante; golden
candlesticks and costly chalices; sometimes a jewelled pix; fantastic
spoons and patens, rings for the fingers and the ear; occasionally a
fair-written and blazoned manuscript--suitable offering to the royal
scholar. Greymount was noticed; sent for; promoted in the household;
knighted; might doubtless have been sworn of the council, and in due
time have become a minister; but his was a discreet ambition--of an
accumulative rather than an aspiring character. He served the king
faithfully in all domestic matters that required an unimpassioned,
unscrupulous agent; fashioned his creed and conscience according to the
royal model in all its freaks; seized the right moment to get sundry
grants of abbey lands, and contrived in that dangerous age to save both
his head and his estate.

The Greymount family having planted themselves in the land, faithful to
the policy of the founder, avoided the public gaze during the troubled
period that followed the reformation; and even during the more orderly
reign of Elizabeth, rather sought their increase in alliances than in
court favour. But at the commencement of the seventeenth century, their
abbey lands infinitely advanced in value, and their rental swollen by
the prudent accumulation of more than seventy years, a Greymount, who
was then a county member, was elevated to the peerage as Baron Marney.
The heralds furnished his pedigree, and assured the world that although
the exalted rank and extensive possessions enjoyed at present by
the Greymounts, had their origin immediately in great territorial
revolutions of a recent reign, it was not for a moment to be supposed,
that the remote ancestors of the Ecclesiastical Commissioner of 1530
were by any means obscure. On the contrary, it appeared that they were
both Norman and baronial, their real name Egremont, which, in their
patent of peerage the family now resumed.

In the civil wars, the Egremonts pricked by their Norman blood, were
cavaliers and fought pretty well. But in 1688, alarmed at the prevalent
impression that King James intended to insist on the restitution of the
church estates to their original purposes, to wit, the education of the
people and the maintenance of the poor, the Lord of Marney Abbey became
a warm adherent of "civil and religious liberty,"--the cause for which
Hampden had died in the field, and Russell on the scaffold,--and joined
the other whig lords, and great lay impropriators, in calling over the
Prince of Orange and a Dutch army, to vindicate those popular principles
which, somehow or other, the people would never support. Profiting by
this last pregnant circumstance, the lay Abbot of Marney also in this
instance like the other whig lords, was careful to maintain, while he
vindicated the cause of civil and religious liberty, a very loyal and
dutiful though secret correspondence with the court of St Germains.

The great deliverer King William the Third, to whom Lord Marney was
a systematic traitor, made the descendant of the Ecclesiastical
Commissioner of Henry the Eighth an English earl; and from that time
until the period of our history, though the Marney family had never
produced one individual eminent for civil or military abilities, though
the country was not indebted to them for a single statesman, orator,
successful warrior, great lawyer, learned divine, eminent author,
illustrious man of science, they had contrived, if not to engross any
great share of public admiration and love, at least to monopolise no
contemptible portion of public money and public dignities. During the
seventy years of almost unbroken whig rule, from the accession of the
House of Hanover to the fall of Mr Fox, Marney Abbey had furnished
a never-failing crop of lord privy seals, lord presidents, and
lord lieutenants. The family had had their due quota of garters and
governments and bishoprics; admirals without fleets, and generals who
fought only in America. They had glittered in great embassies with
clever secretaries at their elbow, and had once governed Ireland when
to govern Ireland was only to apportion the public plunder to a corrupt
senate.

Notwithstanding however this prolonged enjoyment of undeserved
prosperity, the lay abbots of Marney were not content. Not that it was
satiety that induced dissatisfaction. The Egremonts could feed on.
They wanted something more. Not to be prime ministers or secretaries of
state, for they were a shrewd race who knew the length of their tether,
and notwithstanding the encouraging example of his grace of Newcastle,
they could not resist the persuasion that some knowledge of the
interests and resources of nations, some power of expressing opinions
with propriety, some degree of respect for the public and for himself,
were not altogether indispensable qualifications, even under a Venetian
constitution, in an individual who aspired to a post so eminent and
responsible. Satisfied with the stars and mitres and official seals,
which were periodically apportioned to them, the Marney family did not
aspire to the somewhat graceless office of being their distributor. What
they aimed at was promotion in their order; and promotion to the highest
class. They observed that more than one of the other great "civil and
religious liberty" families,--the families who in one century plundered
the church to gain the property of the people, and in another century
changed the dynasty to gain the power of the crown,--had their brows
circled with the strawberry leaf. And why should not this distinction be
the high lot also of the descendants of the old gentleman usher of one
of King Henry's plundering vicar-generals? Why not? True it is, that
a grateful sovereign in our days has deemed such distinction the only
reward for half a hundred victories. True it is, that Nelson, after
conquering the Mediterranean, died only a Viscount! But the house of
Marney had risen to high rank; counted themselves ancient nobility; and
turned up their noses at the Pratts and the Smiths, the Jenkinsons and
the Robinsons of our degenerate days; and never had done anything
for the nation or for their honours. And why should they now? It was
unreasonable to expect it. Civil and religious liberty, that had
given them a broad estate and a glittering coronet, to say nothing
of half-a-dozen close seats in parliament, ought clearly to make them
dukes.

But the other great whig families who had obtained this honour, and who
had done something more for it than spoliate their church and betray
their king, set up their backs against this claim of the Egremonts.
The Egremonts had done none of the work of the last hundred years
of political mystification, during which a people without power or
education, had been induced to believe themselves the freest and most
enlightened nation in the world, and had submitted to lavish their blood
and treasure, to see their industry crippled and their labour mortgaged,
in order to maintain an oligarchy, that had neither ancient memories to
soften nor present services to justify their unprecedented usurpation.

How had the Egremonts contributed to this prodigious result? Their
family had furnished none of those artful orators whose bewildering
phrase had fascinated the public intelligence; none of those toilsome
patricians whose assiduity in affairs had convinced their unprivileged
fellow-subjects that government was a science, and administration an
art, which demanded the devotion of a peculiar class in the state for
their fulfilment and pursuit. The Egremonts had never said anything that
was remembered, or done anything that could be recalled. It was decided
by the Great Revolution families, that they should not be dukes.
Infinite was the indignation of the lay Abbot of Marney. He counted his
boroughs, consulted his cousins, and muttered revenge. The opportunity
soon offered for the gratification of his passion.

The situation of the Venetian party in the wane of the eighteenth
century had become extremely critical. A young king was making often
fruitless, but always energetic, struggles to emancipate his national
royalty from the trammels of the factious dogeship. More than sixty
years of a government of singular corruption had alienated all hearts
from the oligarchy; never indeed much affected by the great body of the
people. It could no longer be concealed, that by virtue of a plausible
phrase power had been transferred from the crown to a parliament, the
members of which were appointed by an extremely limited and exclusive
class, who owned no responsibility to the country, who debated and
voted in secret, and who were regularly paid by the small knot of great
families that by this machinery had secured the permanent possession
of the king's treasury. Whiggism was putrescent in the nostrils of
the nation; we were probably on the eve of a bloodless yet important
revolution; when Rockingham, a virtuous magnifico, alarmed and
disgusted, resolved to revive something of the pristine purity and
high-toned energy of the old whig connection; appealed to his "new
generation" from a degenerate age, arrayed under his banner the generous
youth of the whig families, and was fortunate to enlist in the service
the supreme genius of Edmund Burke.

Burke effected for the whigs what Bolingbroke in a preceding age had
done for the tories: he restored the moral existence of the party. He
taught them to recur to the ancient principles of their connection,
and suffused those principles with all the delusive splendour of his
imagination. He raised the tone of their public discourse; he breathed
a high spirit into their public acts. It was in his power to do more for
the whigs than St John could do for his party. The oligarchy, who had
found it convenient to attaint Bolingbroke for being the avowed
minister of the English Prince with whom they were always in secret
