 A Choice
 Of Miracles

 By JAMES A. COX


    _You're down in the jungle with death staring you in the face. There
    is nothing left but prayer. So you ask for your life. But wait! Are
    you sure that's really what you want above all else?_


Andy Larson was a hard-headed Swede. He had to be, to be still alive. He

as far to the left as it would go told him they had crash-landed on the
water--a river by the sound of it--and had skipped drunkenly, in
something approximating flat stone fashion, into the forest lining the
river's bank. There had been no explosion and no fire, there was no wide
swath cut through the trees--and therefore no reason why he should
assume the patrol would spot him. There might be pieces of the ship
lying where the patrol could see them. But he doubted that, for the
river was deep and the vegetation was thick.

He strained his ears, not to hear if the patrol was approaching closer,
but listening for the sound of life around him. This was his one
