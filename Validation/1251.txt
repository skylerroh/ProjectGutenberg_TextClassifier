     The king sacrifices an ox, a      Over my countenance flowed my
     sheep he slaughters(?).             tears.
     I gazed upon the quarters (of
     the world)--all(?) was sea.

It will be seen that in the Semitic Version the beams of the Sun-god
have been reduced to "daylight", and Ziusudu's act of worship has become
merely prostration in token of grief.

Both in the Gilgamesh Epic and in Berossus the sacrifice offered by the
Deluge hero to the gods follows the episode of the birds, and it takes
place on the top of the mountain after the landing from the vessel. It
is hardly probable that two sacrifices were recounted in the Sumerian
Version, one to the Sun-god in the boat and another on the mountain
after landing; and if we are right in identifying Ziusudu's recorded
sacrifice with that of Ut-napishtim and Xisuthros, it would seem that,
according to the Sumerian Version, no birds were sent out to test the
abatement of the waters. This conclusion cannot be regarded as quite
certain, inasmuch as the greater part of the Fifth Column is waning. We
have, moreover, already seen reason to believe that the account on our
tablet is epitomized, and that consequently the omission of any episode
from our text does not necessarily imply its absence from the original
Sumerian Version which it follows. But here at least it is clear that
nothing can have been omitted between the opening of the light-hole and
the sacrifice, for the one act is the natural sequence of the other. On
the whole it seems preferable to assume that we have recovered a simpler
form of the story.

As the storm itself is described in a few phrases, so the cessation
of the flood may have been dismissed with equal brevity; the gradual
abatement of the waters, as attested by the dove, the swallow, and the
raven, may well be due to later elaboration or to combination with some
variant account. Under its amended form the narrative leads naturally up
to the landing on the mountain and the sacrifice of thanksgiving to
the gods. In the Sumerian Version, on the other hand, Ziusudu regards
himself as saved when he sees the Sun shining; he needs no further tests
to assure himself that the danger is over, and his sacrifice too is one
of gratitude for his escape. The disappearance of the Sun-god from the
Semitic Version was thus a necessity, to avoid an anti-climax; and the
hero's attitude of worship had obviously to be translated into one of
grief. An indication that the sacrifice was originally represented as
having taken place on board the boat may be seen in the lines of
the Gilgamesh Epic which recount how Enlil, after acquiescing in
Ut-napishtim's survival of the Flood, went up into the ship and led
him forth by the hand, although, in the preceding lines, he had already
landed and had sacrificed upon the mountain. The two passages are hardly
consistent as they stand, but they find a simple explanation of we
regard the second of them as an unaltered survival from an earlier form
of the story.

If the above line of reasoning be sound, it follows that, while the
earlier Hebrew Version closely resembles the Gilgamesh Epic, the later
Hebrew Version, by its omission of the birds, would offer a parallel to
the Sumerian Version. But whether we may draw any conclusion from this
apparent grouping of our authorities will be best dealt with when we
have concluded our survey of the new evidence.

As we have seen, the text of the Fifth Column breaks off with Ziusudu's
sacrifice to the Sun-god, after he had opened a light-hole in the boat
and had seen by the god's beams that the storm was over. The missing
portion of the Fifth Column must have included at least some account of
the abatement of the waters, the stranding of the boat, and the
manner in which Anu and Enlil became apprised of Ziusudu's escape, and
consequently of the failure of their intention to annihilate mankind.
For in the Sixth Column of the text we find these two deities reconciled
to Ziusudu and bestowing immortality upon him, as Enlil bestows
immortality upon Ut-napishtim at the close of the Semitic Version. In
the latter account, after the vessel had grounded on Mount Nisir and
Ut-napishtim had tested the abatement of the waters by means of the
birds, he brings all out from the ship and offers his libation and
sacrifice upon the mountain, heaping up reed, cedar-wood, and myrtle
beneath his seven sacrificial vessels. And it was by this act on his
part that the gods first had knowledge of his escape. For they smelt
the sweet savour of the sacrifice, and "gathered like flies over the
sacrificer".(1)

     (1) Gilg. Epic, XI, l. 162.

It is possible in our text that Ziusudu's sacrifice in the boat was also
the means by which the gods became acquainted with his survival; and
it seems obvious that the Sun-god, to whom it was offered, should have
continued to play some part in the narrative, perhaps by assisting
Ziusudu in propitiating Anu and Enlil. In the Semitic-Babylonian
Version, the first deity to approach the sacrifice is Belit-ili or
Ishtar, who is indignant with Enlil for what he has done. When Enlil
himself approaches and sees the ship he is filled with anger against the
gods, and, asking who has escaped, exclaims that no man must live in the
destruction. Thereupon Ninib accuses Ea, who by his pleading succeeds in
turning Enlil's purpose. He bids Enlil visit the sinner with his sin and
lay his transgression on the transgressor; Enlil should not again send a
deluge to destroy the whole of mankind, but should be content with less
wholesale destruction, such as that wrought by wild beasts, famine, and
plague. Finally he confesses that it was he who warned Ziusudu of the
gods' decision by sending him a dream. Enlil thereupon changes his
intention, and going up into the ship, leads Ut-napishtim forth.
Though Ea's intervention finds, of course, no parallel in either Hebrew
version, the subject-matter of his speech is reflected in both. In the
earlier Hebrew Version Yahweh smells the sweet savour of Noah's burnt
offering and says in his heart he will no more destroy every living
creature as he had done; while in the later Hebrew Version Elohim,
after remembering Noah and causing the waters to abate, establishes his
covenant to the same effect, and, as a sign of the covenant, sets his
bow in the clouds.

In its treatment of the climax of the story we shall see that the
Sumerian Version, at any rate in the form it has reached us, is on
a lower ethical level than the Babylonian and Hebrew Versions. Ea's
argument that the sinner should bear his own sin and the transgressor
his own transgression in some measure forestalls that of Ezekiel;(1)
and both the Hebrew Versions represent the saving of Noah as part of the
divine intention from the beginning. But the Sumerian Version introduces
the element of magic as the means by which man can bend the will of the
gods to his own ends. How far the details of the Sumerian myth at this
point resembled that of the Gilgamesh Epic it is impossible to say, but
the general course of the story must have been the same. In the latter
Enlil's anger is appeased, in the former that of Anu and Enlil; and it
is legitimate to suppose that Enki, like Ea, was Ziusudu's principal
supporter, in view of the part he had already taken in ensuring his
escape.

VI. THE PROPITIATION OF THE ANGRY GODS, AND ZIUSUDU'S IMMORTALITY

The presence of the puzzling lines, with which the Sixth Column of
our text opens, was not explained by Dr. Poebel; indeed, they would be
difficult to reconcile with his assumption that our text is an epic pure
and simple. But if, as is suggested above, we are dealing with a myth in
magical employment, they are quite capable of explanation. The problem
these lines present will best be stated by giving a translation of
the extant portion of the column, where they will be seen with their
immediate context in relation to what follows them:

     "By the Soul of Heaven, by the soul of Earth, shall ye conjure him,
     That with you he may . . . !
     Anu and Enlil by the Soul of Heaven, by the Soul of Earth, shall ye
     conjure,
     And with you will he . . . !

     "The _niggilma_ of the ground springs forth in abundance(?)!"
     Ziusudu, the king,
     Before Anu and Enlil bows himself down.
     Life like (that of) a god he gives to him,
     An eternal soul like (that of) a god he creates for him.
     At that time Ziusudu, the king,
     The name of the _niggilma_ (named) "Preserver of the Seed of
     Mankind".

     In a . . . land,(1) the land(1) of Dilmun(?), they caused him to
     dwell.

     (1) Possibly to be translated "mountain". The rendering of
     the proper name as that of Dilmun is very uncertain. For the
     probable identification of Dilmun with the island of Bahrein
     in the Persian Gulf, cf. Rawlinson, _Journ. Roy. As. Soc._,
     1880, pp. 20 ff.; and see further, Meissner, _Orient. Lit-
     Zeit._, XX. No. 7, col. 201 ff.

The first two lines of the column are probably part of the speech of
some deity, who urges the necessity of invoking or conjuring Anu and
Enlil "by the Soul of Heaven, by the Soul of Earth", in order to secure
their support or approval. Now Anu and Enlil are the two great gods
who had determined on mankind's destruction, and whose wrath at his own
escape from death Ziusudu must placate. It is an obvious inference that
conjuring "by the Soul of Heaven" and "by the Soul of Earth" is either
the method by which Ziusudu has already succeeded in appeasing their
anger, or the means by which he is here enjoined to attain that end.
Against the latter alternative it is to be noted that the god is
addressing more than one person; and, further, at Ziusudu is evidently
already pardoned, for, so far from following the deity's advice,
he immediately prostrates himself before Anu and Enlil and receives
immortality. We may conjecture that at the close of the Fifth Column
Ziusudu had already performed the invocation and thereby had appeased
the divine wrath; and that the lines at the beginning of the Sixth
Column point the moral of the story by enjoining on Ziusudu and his
descendants, in other words on mankind, the advisability of employing
this powerful incantation at their need. The speaker may perhaps
have been one of Ziusudu's divine helpers--the Sun-god to whom he had
sacrificed, or Enki who had saved him from the Flood. But it seems to me
more probable that the words are uttered by Anu and Enlil themselves.(1)
For thereby they would be represented as giving their own sanction
to the formula, and as guaranteeing its magical efficacy. That the
incantation, as addressed to Anu and Enlil, would be appropriate is
obvious, since each would be magically approached through his own sphere
of control.

     (1) One of them may have been the speaker on behalf of both.

It is significant that at another critical point of the story we have
already met with a reference to conjuring "by the Name of Heaven and
Earth", the phrase occurring at the close of the Third Column after the
reference to the dream or dreams. There, as we saw, we might possibly
explain the passage as illustrating one aspect of Ziusudu's piety:
he may have been represented as continually practising this class of
divination, and in that case it would be natural enough that in the
final crisis of the story he should have propitiated the gods he
conjured by the same means. Or, as a more probable alternative, it was
suggested that we might connect the line with Enki's warning, and assume
that Ziusudu interpreted the dream-revelation of Anu and Enlil's purpose
by means of the magical incantation which was peculiarly associated with
them. On either alternative the phrase fits into the story itself, and
there is no need to suppose that the narrative is interrupted, either
in the Third or in the Sixth Column, by an address to the hearers of the
myth, urging them to make the invocation on their own behalf.

On the other hand, it seems improbable that the lines in question formed
part of the original myth; they may have been inserted to weld the myth
more closely to the magic. Both incantation and epic may have originally
existed independently, and, if so, their combination would have been
suggested by their contents. For while the former is addressed to Anu
and Enlil, in the latter these same gods play the dominant parts: they
are the two chief creators, it is they who send the Flood, and it is
their anger that must be appeased. If once combined, the further step
of making the incantation the actual means by which Ziusudu achieved
his own rescue and immortality would be a natural development. It may be
added that the words would have been an equally appropriate addition if
the incantation had not existed independently, but had been suggested
by, and developed from, the myth.

In the third and eleventh lines of the column we have further references
to the mysterious object, the creation of which appears to have been
recorded in the First Column of the text between man's creation and
that of animals. The second sign of the group composing its name was not
recognized by Dr. Poebel, but it is quite clearly written in two of the
passages, and has been correctly identified by Professor Barton.(1)
The Sumerian word is, in fact, to be read _nig-gil-ma_,(2) which, when
preceded by the determinative for "pot", "jar", or "bowl", is given in
a later syllabary as the equivalent of the Semitic word _mashkhalu_.
Evidence that the word _mashkhalu_ was actually employed to denote a jar
or vessel of some sort is furnished by one of the Tel el-Amarna letters
which refers to "one silver _mashkhalu_" and "one (or two) stone
_mashkhalu_".(3) In our text the determinative is absent, and it is
possible that the word is used in another sense. Professor Barton, in
both passages in the Sixth Column, gives it the meaning "curse"; he
interprets the lines as referring to the removal of a curse from the
earth after the Flood, and he compares Gen. viii. 21, where Yahweh
declares he will not again "curse the ground for man's sake". But this
translation ignores the occurrence of the word in the First Column,
where the creation of the _niggilma_ is apparently recorded; and his
rendering "the seed that was cursed" in l. 11 is not supported by the
photographic reproduction of the text, which suggests that the first
sign in the line is not that for "seed", but is the sign for "name", as
correctly read by Dr. Poebel. In that passage the _niggilma_ appears to
be given by Ziusudu the name "Preserver of the Seed of Mankind", which
we have already compared to the title bestowed on Uta-napishtim's ship,
"Preserver of Life". Like the ship, it must have played an important
part in man's preservation, which would account not only for the
honorific title but for the special record of its creation.

     (1) See _American Journal of Semitic Languages_, Vol. XXXI,
     April 1915, p. 226.

     (2) It is written _nig-gil_ in the First Column.

     (3) See Winckler, _El-Amarna_, pl. 35 f., No. 28, Obv., Col.
     II, l. 45, Rev., Col. I, l. 63, and Knudtzon, _El-Am. Taf._,
     pp. 112, 122; the vessels were presents from Amenophis IV to
     Burnaburiash.

It we may connect the word with the magical colouring of the myth, we
might perhaps retain its known meaning, "jar" or "bowl", and regard it
as employed in the magical ceremony which must have formed part of
the invocation "by the Soul of Heaven, by the Soul of Earth". But
the accompanying references to the ground, to its production from the
ground, and to its springing up, if the phrases may be so rendered,
suggest rather some kind of plant;(1) and this, from its employment in
magical rites, may also have given its name to a bowl or vessel which
held it. A very similar plant was that found and lost by Gilgamesh,
after his sojourn with Ut-napishtim; it too had potent magical power and
bore a title descriptive of its peculiar virtue of transforming old age
to youth. Should this suggestion prove to be correct, the three passages
mentioning the _niggilma_ must be classed with those in which the
invocation is referred to, as ensuring the sanction of the myth to
further elements in the magic. In accordance with this view, the fifth
line in the Sixth Column is probably to be included in the divine
speech, where a reference to the object employed in the ritual would not
be out of place. But it is to be hoped that light will be thrown on
this puzzling word by further study, and perhaps by new fragments of
the text; meanwhile it would be hazardous to suggest a more definite
rendering.

     (1) The references to "the ground", or "the earth", also
     tend to connect it peculiarly with Enlil. Enlil's close
     association with the earth, which is, of course,
     independently attested, is explicitly referred to in the
     Babylonian Version (cf. Gilg. Epic. XI, ll. 39-42).
     Suggested reflections of this idea have long been traced in
     the Hebrew Versions; cf. Gen. viii. 21 (J), where Yahweh
     says he will not again curse the ground, and Gen. ix. 13
     (P), where Elohim speaks of his covenant "between me and the
     earth".

With the sixth line of the column it is clear that the original
narrative of the myth is resumed.(1) Ziusudu, the king, prostrates
himself before Anu and Enlil, who bestow immortality upon him and cause
him to dwell in a land, or mountain, the name of which may perhaps be
read as Dilmun. The close parallelism between this portion of the text
and the end of the myth in the Gilgamesh Epic will be seen from the
following extracts,(2) the magical portions being omitted from the
Sumerian Version:

     (1) It will also be noted that with this line the text again
     falls naturally into couplets.

     (2) Col. VI, ll. 6-9 and 12 are there compared with Gilg.
     Epic, XI, ll. 198-205.

     SUMERIAN VERSION                    SEMITIC VERSION

     Then Enlil went up into the
     ship;
     Ziusudu, the king,                  He took me by the hand and led
     me forth.
     Before Anu and Enlil bows himself   He brought out my wife and
     down.                               caused her to bow down at my
     side;
     He touched our brows, standing
     between us and blessing us:
     Life like (that of) a god he        "Formerly was Ut-napishtim of
     gives to him.                       mankind,
     An eternal soul like (that of) a    But now let Ut-napishtim be
     god he creates for him.             like the gods, even us!
     And let Ut-napishtim dwell afar
     off at the mouth of the
     rivers!"
     In a . . . land, the land of(1)     Then they took me and afar off,
     Dilmun(?), they caused him to       at the mouth of the rivers,
     dwell.                              they caused me to dwell.

     (1) Or, "On a mountain, the mountain of", &c.

The Sumerian Version thus apparently concludes with the familiar ending
of the legend which we find in the Gilgamesh Epic and in Berossus,
though it here occurs in an abbreviated form and with some variations in
detail. In all three versions the prostration of the Deluge hero before
the god is followed by the bestowal of immortality upon him, a fate
which, according to Berossus, he shared with his wife, his daughter, and
the steersman. The Gilgamesh Epic perhaps implies that Ut-napishtim's
wife shared in his immortality, but the Sumerian Version mentions
Ziusudu alone. In the Gilgamesh Epic Ut-napishtim is settled by the gods
at the mouth of the rivers, that is to say at the head of the Persian
Gulf, while according to a possible rendering of the Sumerian Version he
is made to dwell on Dilmun, an island in the Gulf itself. The fact that
Gilgamesh in the Epic has to cross the sea to reach Ut-napishtim may be
cited in favour of the reading "Dilmun"; and the description of the sea
as "the Waters of Death", if it implies more than the great danger
of their passage, was probably a later development associated with
Ut-napishtim's immortality. It may be added that in neither Hebrew
version do we find any parallel to the concluding details of the
original story, the Hebrew narratives being brought to an end with the
blessing of Noah and the divine promise to, or covenant with, mankind.
