Indian and White Man

The game of "Indian and White Man" is interesting. A circle is drawn on
the campus. It is supposed that the white people are travelling over the
prairie, and at night time they prepare to camp. The circle represents
their camp. The Whites lie down to sleep and sentries are posted. The
Indians discover the camp and endeavor to capture the Whites. Then comes
the battle royal. Every Indian captured in the white man's circle counts
one, and every white man captured by the Indians outside the circle counts
one for their side. The game continues until all of either side are
captured. The players are divided into two groups. The Indians are
concealed in the bushes or some place unseen by the Whites and they make
the attack.

Such games as "Three Deep," "Bull in the Ring," "Tag Game," "Leap Frog,"
will be found to interest the boys during the after-supper period.

The following are campus games requiring apparatus:

German Bowling

Plant in the ground two posts, leaving at least 15 feet above ground.
Spike a 10-foot piece across the top (see page 218). An ordinary ball used
in bowling is used by plugging shut the holes and inserting a screw eye in
one of the plugged holes. Tie tightly to this screw eye a strong piece of
rope. A good-sized screw eye is fastened in the cross piece of the frame,
and to this tie the ball. Nine bowling pins are used. The score is the
same as bowling. The pins are knocked off by the return of the ball, as
shown in the diagram.

Tether Ball

The upright pole should be standing ten feet out of the ground and firmly
imbedded in the earth so as not to vibrate.

[Illustration: Tether Ball]

The pole should be 7-1/2 inches in circumference at the ground and
tapering toward the upper end. Paint a black or white 2-inch band around
the pole 6 feet above the ground. Draw a circle about the pole on the
ground having a 3-foot radius. A 20-foot line must bisect the circle. Use
a tennis ball having a netted or tightly fitting linen cover. The ball is
fastened to a string with a ring and suspended from the top of the pole by
a piece of heavy braided fish line. The cord should allow the ball to hang
7-1/2 feet. Tennis racquets are used. The two players stand at point
marked with an X in the diagram. In the toss-up for courts the loser is
the server. The ball may be struck in any manner with the racquet, the
endeavor being to wind the string upon the pole above the painted band.

Volley Ball

Stretch a tennis net across the campus and mark a court fifty feet long,
to be divided equally by the net. The play consists in keeping in motion
the ball over the net from one side to the other, until one fails to
return it, which counts as an out. The ball used is similar to a football,
only smaller. The game consists of twenty-one points.

Many of the camps have tennis courts and hold tournaments. This game is so
universal and familiar that no description will be made.

AQUATIC SPORTS AND WATER GAMES

Aquatic sports may be arranged so that active interest will be taken by
all the boys, or they may be simply an exhibition of the swimming
abilities of several boys. The former is decidedly preferable. Events
should be arranged for the small as well as the large boys.

[Illustration: The Human Frog at Camp Kineo]

 ATHLETICS AND WATER SPORTS 221

The program of events should include a short dash, swimming under water,
diving for form, fancy swimming and special stunts, ribbon awards or
inexpensive cups to be given the winners. The Life Saving Corps will have
an opportunity to give an exhibition of their skill and alertness, as well
as patrol the swimming beach. Good reliable fellows should be appointed to
watch each swimmer when in the water. Run no chances at any time that boys
are in the water. The following water games have been suggested by A. B.
Wegener.

1. Three-legged swimming.
2. Tug of War.
3. Bobbing for Corks.
4. Plunging through hoops for height or distance.
5. Diving for objects.
6. Egg Race; holding the egg in a spoon either in the mouth or  hand.
7. Tag games.
8. Potato race; using corks instead of potatoes.
9. Candle race; candles are lighted and must be kept lighted.
10. Various land games may be adapted for water use, such as ball
passing (using a water polo ball), relay race, etc.

Water Basket Ball

Two peach baskets, or rope baskets, or two iron rings are hung upon
poles five feet above the water and forty feet apart. The game is
played similarly to basket ball, except that the players are allowed
to advance with the ball. Tackling and ducking are fouls and penalized
by allowing a free throw for goal from a point fifteen feet away.
There is no out of bounds, and a basket may be thrown from any place
in the water. A field goal counts two points, and a goal from a foul
one point.

Water Baseball

The outfit required is a tennis ball, a broom stick and four rafts--
one large and three small. The batsman and catcher stand on the big
raft. On a small raft, ten yards away, stands  the pitcher and the
other two rafts are placed at easy swimming distance for bases. In
striking, everything counts--bunt, swat or foul tip. The moment bat
and ball come in contact the batsman starts for first base. There are
five men on a side. Lots of fun. Avoid remaining in fresh water too
long as it has a tendency to weaken vitality.

Old Clothes Race

The contestants are dressed in a full suit of old clothes. At the word
"go" they dive into the water and swim to a float placed at a certain
distance away, undress and return. This is a very funny race.

Tilting

Two boats manned by four boys each. One boy is the spearman and is
armed with a light pole about eight or ten feet long, having a soft
pad of rags, or better yet, of water-proof canvas duck to keep it from
getting wet and soggy. If a flat-bottom boat is used, the spearman
stands on one of the end seats. A quarter-deck or raised platform
should be built on an ordinary boat or canoe. The battle is fought in
rounds and by points. If you put your opponent back into the boat with
one foot it counts you 5; two feet, 10. If he loses his spear you
count 5 (except when he is put overboard). If you put him down on one
knee on the "fighting deck," you count 5; two knees, 10. If you put
him overboard it counts 25. One hundred points is a round. A battle is
for one or more rounds as agreed upon. It is forbidden to strike below
the belt. The umpire may dock for fouls.

Canoe Tag

Any number of canoes or boats may engage in this water game. A rubber
football is used. The game is to tag the other canoe or boat by
throwing this into it. The rules are as in ordinary cross tag.

Whale Hunt

The "whale" is made of a big log of wood with a rough-shaped head and
tail to represent a whale. Two boats are used, each manned by the boys
of one tent--the leader acting as captain, a boy as bowman or
harpooner, the others as oarsmen. Each boat belongs to a different
harbor, the two harbors being some distance apart. The umpire takes
the "whale" and lets it loose about half-way between the two harbors
and on a signal the two boats race out to see who can get to the
"whale" first. The harpooner who first arrives within range of the
"whale" drives his harpoon into it and the boat promptly turns around
and tows the "whale" to its harbor. The second boat pursues and when
it overtakes the other, also harpoons the "whale," turns around and
endeavors to tow the "whale" to its harbor. In this way the two boats
have a tug-of-war and eventually the better boat tows the "whale" and
possibly the opposing boat into its harbor.


Shoot-the-Chute

[Illustration: Diagram For "Chute"]

A "Shoot-the-Chute" is great fun and one should be built in every
permanent camp and "Swimming Hole." The one described is by A. D. Murray
and has stood the test of several years in a number of camps.

The plan drawn is for a chute 40 feet long, 3 feet wide and 18 feet high.
These dimensions can be changed in length and height, but not in width.
The chute is built of 7/8-inch matched pine boards, to the same width as
sheet zinc, usually 3 feet; the boards being firmly cleated together on
the under side by 2 x 6-inch cleats 5 feet apart, throughout the length of
the chute. Boards should be screwed to the cleats from the face of the
chute with 1-1/2-inch screws, the heads being counter sunk. The several
lengths of zinc are soldered into one piece, the joints being on the under
side (as shingles on a roof) fastened to the boards with 8-oz. tacks; set
in from the edge about 1 inch and about 6 inches apart. The side strips of
maple (soft wood will not do on account of the danger of splintering) 2
inches wide and 3 inches high, rounded slightly on upper edge, are placed
directly over the edge of the zinc and covering the tacks. Screw the
strips firmly to the chute with 2-inch screws from the under side. These
ought to be placed not more than 2 feet apart. Probably each will have two
or more strips in making a piece of sufficient length. If so, care should
be taken to have the pieces joined on a bevel with a slant from outer edge
toward bottom of chute so as to leave no edge. The utmost care should be
used to have a perfectly smooth surface on the inside of the chute. A pump
or bucket is needed at the top of the chute to wet the surface before the
swimmer starts his slide. The supports A, B, C, should be firmly braced
with 2 x 4-inch timber, D, and lower end of chute should extend over the
pier at least 1 foot and not nearer the surface of the water than 3 feet
perpendicularly, allowing the swimmer to enter the water as in a dive. The
chute can be fastened to the supporting braces through timbers E, F, into
maple side strips with a good heavy log screw. A platform 3 feet wide and
4 feet long near the top of chute, and set just waist deep from the top of
chute will make starting easy.

Archery

Richard the Lion-hearted, of England, said the five essential points of
archery--standing, nocking[1], drawing, holding, and loosing--"honestly
represented all the principles of life."

Archery develops the muscles in all-round fashion, particularly those of
the shoulder, arm and wrist.

[Transcriber's Footnote 1: A nock is the groove at either end of a bow for
holding the bowstring or the notch in the end of an arrow that fits on the
bowstring.]

The Target

A target can be made of a burlap sack, or oil cloth, about five feet
square. Stuff this with hay or straw. It may be flattened by a few
quilting stitches put right through with a long packing needle. On this
the target is painted. In scoring, the centre is 9, the next circle 7, the
next 5, the next 3 and the last circle 1. The shortest match range for the
target is forty yards.

The Bow

The bow may be made from any of the following woods--mulberry, sassafras,
southern cedar, black locust, black walnut, apple, slippery elm or
hickory. In making a bow, select wood with straight grain. The length of
the bow should be about the height of the boy using it, or if the boy is
between ten and fifteen years of age, his bow should not be less than four
feet in length and not more than five feet. When buying a bow get one of
lancewood backed with hickory.

Making A Bow

The making of the bow and arrow is described by A. Neeley Hall, as
follows: "Cut your piece of wood five feet long, and, after placing it in
a bench vise to hold it in position, shape it down with a drawknife or
plane until it is one inch wide by one-half inch thick at the handle, and
three quarters inch wide by one-quarter inch thick at the ends. The bow
can be made round or flat on the face toward the archer. Cut a notch in
the bow two inches from each end, as shown in the illustration, from which
to attach the bow-string. A cord with as little elasticity as possible
should be used for this. A good string can be purchased for twenty-five
cents.

[Illustration: Notch for Bowstrings; Length of Bow 5 feet. Wire nail with
head cut off (arrow head) Old Canvas Stuffed (target); Loop (in
bowstring); slip knot.]

With a home-made bow-string, a loop should be made in one end and bound
with thread, as shown in illustration, p. 227. Slip the loop over the
upper notch, bend the bow until the center of the string is about five
inches away from the handle, and attach the loose end to the lower notch
by means of a slip-knot similar to that shown in the drawing. The bow
should then be sandpapered until smooth, and thoroughly oiled with linseed
oil. Glue a piece of velvet about three inches wide around the center for
a handle."

Making Arrows

Arrows are divided into three parts: the head, sometimes called the pile,
the shaft and the feathers. The shaft is generally made of hickory, ash,
elm or pine, and its length is dependent upon that of the bow. For a
five-foot bow, make the length two feet and the width and thickness about
one-half inch. For target practice a wire nail driven into the end of the
pile, as shown on page 227, with the head of the nail filed off and
pointed, makes an excellent head. Feathering is the next operation. Turkey
and goose feathers are generally used. Strip off the broader side of the
vane of three feathers and glue them to the shaft one inch and a quarter
from the notch, spacing them equally from each other. One feather should
be placed at right angles to the notch. This is known as the cock feather
and should always point away from the bow when the arrow is shot.

Archery

The rules for the five essential points are these:

Standing: In taking position to draw the bow, the heels must be seven to
eight inches apart, feet firm on the ground, yet easy and springy, not
rigid.

Nocking: This is manipulating the bow string. Hold the string with two
fingers and the arrow between the first and second fingers. Grip firmly,
but not so as to give awkwardness to any finger.

Drawing: In drawing stand with the left shoulder toward the target,
turning the head only from the neck and looking over the left shoulder.
Then raise the bow with the left hand, keeping the upper end inclined one
or two degrees from the body. With the right hand draw the arrow to
chin-level and below the ear.

Holding: Steady the aim a moment and keep the point of aim directly in
view, looking along the whole length of the arrow.

Loosing: In letting the arrow go, do not jerk, but loose smoothly, and be
certain your bow arm does not move when loosing. To get a clean, sharp
loose is more than half way to hitting the target.

BIBLIOGRAPHY

If nature is to be a resource in a man's life, one's relation to her must
not be too exact and formal, but more that of a lover and friend.--John
Burroughs.

Outdoor Instinct

"The boy is always nearer to the heart of nature than the grown man. He
has a passionate love of the open air and of the fields and woods; he is
never really happy indoors. Nature has planted this outdoor instinct in
the boy's heart for the good of the race." Day and night teach him their
lessons. The boy will absorb much that is interesting and also much that
will be of real value in giving him a broader outlook upon life. Camping
gives abundant opportunity for the study of nature.

Nature study is not a fad of modern times. Nearly three hundred and fifty
years before Christ, Alexander the Great placed at the disposal of his
tutor, Aristotle, the services of one thousand men throughout Asia and
Greece with instructions to collect and report details concerning the
life, conditions and habits of fishes, birds, beasts and insects. To this
magnificent equipment of assistants, Alexander added fifteen thousand
dollars in gold for books and laboratory supplies.

Prof. L. H. Bailey says, "The modern idea of Nature Study is, to put the
boy in a sympathetic attitude toward nature for the purpose of increasing
the joy of living. Nature study is not science. It is not knowledge. It is
spirit. It is concerned with the boy's outlook on the world.... This
Nature spirit is growing, and there are many ways of knowing the fields
and woods. A new literature has been born. It is the literature of the
out-of-doors."

Collectors

Boys are natural born collectors. They are interrogation points, full of
curiosity, like the "man from Missouri," they want to know. The wise
leader will say, "Let us find out some thing about this tree, or plant, or
bird, or whatever it may be, and together we will be learners." The
textbook method will not work in a boys' camp. "Go find me a flower" is
the true method, and let us see what it is. Nature study books and
leaflets should be used merely as guides, not as texts.

Arousing Interest

Arouse interest by encouraging the boys to make collections of leaves,
flowers, etc., found in the vicinity of the camp. Leaves and flowers may
be pressed in a home-made press and mounted upon heavy paper or cardboard.
The following suggestions are given by Dan Beard and quoted by permission
of Charles Scribner's Sons from his Book, "The Field and Forest Handy
Book."

[Illustration: The Vreeland Press]

Herbarium

"The illustration shows how the press is made. In using the press, first
place the plants or leaves, enclosed in their wrappers and dryers of
newspapers, on the bottom board, put the top board over them, bring the
hinged lever down and bind the whole together with a stout strap put
around the end of the lever and the handle of the bottom board. As this
strap is drawn tight the lever bends, and so keeps a constant pressure on
the plants and leaves even when they shrink in drying. Dryers should be
changed at least every day. Mount specimens on separate herbarium sheets
of standard size (1-1/2 X 16-1/2). Each specimen should be mounted with
name (common and botanical), where found, date and any other facts of
interest. This label is usually pasted in the lower right hand corner of
the herbarium sheet."

Equipment

If the camp has a permanent building, these specimens make a most
attractive decoration as well as help to recall the happy days of "the
hunt." The material equipment for nature study should consist of a good
loose leaf note-book, something that will stand the out-door wear. Get
quadrille ruled sheets. They will simplify sketching in the matter of
proportion and scale. A pocket magnifying glass will serve for
identification of the specimens. An inexpensive combination tweezer and
magnifying glass is made by Asher Kleinman, 250 Eighth Avenue, New York
(50 cents). Best of all is a high-power microscope, especially where the
camp has a permanent building with suitable room, having a good light and
table facilities. A camera will help in securing permanent records of
trees, ferns, flowers, birds, freaks of nature and scenes other than the
usual camp groups. A few reliable books on nature study are needed to
complete the outfit.

Hunting

A "bird hunt" was a popular sport in one of my camps. We started off early
one morning, a group of boys, each "loaded" with a big lunchbox crammed
with good things, a note-book, a book on bird-life, and a "gun." The "gun"
we used was a powerful pair of field glasses. On the way we counted the
number of bird-homes we saw. Just as we were thinking about stopping and
