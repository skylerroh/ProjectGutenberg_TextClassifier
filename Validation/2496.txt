at Brad.

"Colonel, my Government requires an inventory
of Slingshot properties, materials and supplies
in your depot and on the transports nearby. The
information we develop from this one-time inventory
will be used to compute UIPS taxes while the
depot and transports are in Plutonian jurisdiction.
My fleet is escorting the inventory specialists.
Please arrange for them to board your Depot and
the transports on both sides of your force field,
so that they can get to their work."

"I have not received instructions from my
Government concerning the inventory or the taxes
to which you refer."

"That is between you and your Government. I am
here at the express order of President Narval to
see that the inventory is conducted. May I count
on your cooperation?"

"If I decline, what then?"

"Blockade, for starters."

"The UIPS will not permit your interference with
our operations."

"Is that the formal response of your Government
to my request?"

A short pause. "No."

"Then I suggest you dispense with posturing and
arrange to receive the inventory crews. Please
instruct all Masters of transports and other ships
doing business with your depot to cooperate with
our agents."

Another voice cut in, heavy with anger.

"No goddamned shakedown artists are coming
aboard my ship."

Brad motioned Drummer to give him the mike,
indicating by his facial expression that the
intruder did not deserve a direct response
from Drummer's level.

"This is Commander Curtin," Brad said with
low-toned authority, "Executive to Admiral
Drummer. Who speaks?"

He winked at Drummer, who leaned back in his
chair, grinning.

"Lieutenant Bura, commanding the transport
Sandbox. I repeat: keep your damn squeeze clerks
away from my ship, regardless how legitimate
you claim your purpose to be."

"You're in no position to refuse," Brad shot back.
"You're in Plutonian territory, and we have every
right to employ police or military powers to
enforce our jurisdiction. You will cooperate in
this inventory, peacefully, if possible; under
force, if necessary."

"You'll have to fight your way on to my ship."
Bura's voice was harsh, angry. "Be advised we are
armed and prepared to repel unauthorized boarders.
I take your demands to be attempted extortion, and
a clear threat to the safety of my ship, crew and
cargo. That, at the least, is piracy in my book,
and I am within my authority to use force to keep
pirates off my ship. Now, chew on that."

"Lieutenant Bura." Brad's voice was space-cold.
"You now insult the Plutonian Government by
accusing it of piracy. Your attitude gives us good
reason to question the purpose of your presence
in our territory. By your words, you command an
armed vessel. Now you dare to threaten legitimate
representatives of a sovereign nation with your
guns. We have no choice but to conclude you are
a danger to our ships and to our people."

"Ridiculous. I am merely protecting the safety
and integrity of my ship."

"So you say. Nevertheless, you have threatened
to use force against our exercise of legitimate
rights. Tell me, Bura, is your ship really a
commercial cargo transporter or is it a UIPS
warship with a military mission inside our legal
jurisdiction?"

"What in hell are you trying to do, whoever you
are? My ship is a transporter of cargo, and you
know that damned well."

"I know no such thing. All I know is that you claim
to be armed and say you will use your weapons
against us. I repeat: are you on a military
mission?"

"No, damn it, I am not."

"I don't believe you."

"That's your problem."

"Not at all, my man, it's yours. You insult and
then threaten harm to us." Brad grinned at Drummer,
who was watching him with an appraising expression.
"Our fire control system has you marked and our
guns are trained on your ship. How does that strike
you?"

Silence.

"I say," Brad roared, "Bura of the Sandbox, how
does that strike you? You have ten seconds to
reply."

Lieutenant Bura's voice came in, low and tight
with suppressed rage.

"I read you, loud and clear. My gun crews are
standing down."

"Unacceptable, Bura," Brad said flatly, "you remain
a serious obstacle to the success of our mission.
Stand by and do not interrupt again. Admiral
Drummer wishes to complete this transaction with
the Depot Commander. Colonel Hanno, we are waiting
for your answer to Admiral Drummer's request,
which, I repeat, is to arrange for our inventory
specialists to perform their duties aboard your
Depot and the transports within your control area."

"I take note of your fleet's deployment, Admiral
Drummer," the voice of Colonel Hanno was
subdued but intense, "and the manner in which your
Executive responded to Lieutenant Bura's protest.
My responsibility for the safety of UIPS supplies,
properties and personnel under my command
and for UIPS vessels in the Planet Pluto Special
Zone leaves me no choice but to accede to your
outrageous demands. I do so under most solemn and
vigorous protest, and only because your guns are
trained at our heads. Be aware these conversations
are being recorded and spunnel-transmitted to my
Government as we speak."

"Your protests are noted, Colonel Hanno," Drummer
said, taking over. "Please convey our respects
to your Government. Now, as to procedure for
the audit, I suggest we set up a small group of
administrators and specialists to prepare schedules
and other details. This must be done immediately,
as we have no wish to delay your support operations
unnecessarily. Do you agree?"

"Yes."

"Good. One of my ships is now approaching the
Gateway. I realize you may have reservations
concerning one of my military craft entering your
restricted zone, and I respect your reservations.
Please have your representatives board the
Plutonian craft outside the Gateway. My specialists
are aboard, and the two groups can work out the
details. Is this satisfactory?"

"I reject your term 'satisfactory', and accede
under the same protest."

"I understand, Colonel Hanno. By the way, one
other matter, concerning the Sandbox. I cannot
accept Bura's assurance that his gun crews are
on 'stand down'."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean, Colonel Hanno, that I insist on an
inspection of the Sandbox by members of my military
staff so that I am certain the Sandbox's guns are
not a threat to the safety of my fleet. I cannot
continue to dissipate my capabilities by the need
to keep the Sandbox under special surveillance
throughout this operation. The Sandbox guns must
be rendered inoperative and, frankly, I don't trust
Bura to perform that service for me."

"Lieutenant Bura," said Colonel Hanno, "I assume
that you and other ships' Commanders have been
listening in on this delightful exchange."

"I have."

"What do you say?"

"You're the Zone Commander."

"For the safety of your ship and the rest of us,
I recommend you comply with their demand."

"Yes, sir."

"Admiral Drummer?"

"Very good. Have the Sandbox stand by to receive
boarders. This completes our discussion, Colonel
Hanno. I'll get back to you if the situation calls
for it."





 Chapter EIGHTEEN


Brad studied the Sandbox on the utility's view
screen.

"I think you'd better have a look," he said to
Kumiko as he twisted aside on the cramped flight
deck. She peered over his shoulder.

"Got a problem?" Scarf sneered, his bulk cramped
the remaining space behind the flitter's pilot
seat. He hunched forward trying to see around
Kumiko.

Brad ignored the question. He waited for Kumiko's
assessment of the Sandbox, dead ahead.

Drummer had given him the job.

"I want this done," he told Brad, "in a way that
will demonstrate to the UIPS that we're serious,
and can back our words with actions. We've got
to replace their image of us as misfits. They've
got to see us as an organized military force that
can defend its vital interests and, if necessary,
impose its will."

"What do you have in mind?"

"I want to use Kumiko's expertise as a weapons
officer familiar with Inner Region ordnance. I want
both of you to board the Sandbox and check all
installed armament that can be directed against
our fleet. Avoid a scrap, but if you find the guns
have not been deactivated, do it for them."

He pointed at Brad to give emphasis to his words.

"I don't want their weapons slipping back into
operational status as soon as you leave their ship.
Whatever it is you do, fix their armament controls
so that it'll take them at least fifteen hours to
get them back on line. We'll need that much time
to finish our job here and return to base."

Scarf joined them, listening.

"I don't like it." His words were angry; his
features petulant.

Drummer looked at Scarf with open scorn.

"Your likes and dislikes are the least of my
concerns," he snorted and turned back to Brad.

Scarf cut back in.

"I repeat, Drummer, I don't like it, and what I
like or don't like is your concern. I'm here on
counter-intelligence work, and I don't like your
sending this guy," thumbing toward Brad, "and
one of his sidekicks over to a UIPS ship on a highly
sensitive assignment. I'm not that trusting they'll
do the job as thoroughly as you're laying it out."

Drummer frowned.

"What do you suggest?"

"That I go along."

Brad stepped back to let the two work it out.
He didn't relish the assignment. The Sandbox's
commander was not going to accept boarders
graciously.

"You go along? What the hell for?"

"To see how the assignment is carried out, and
frankly, to make sure this guy doesn't, shall
we say, inadvertently pass information to
the enemy." After a brief pause, Scarf added,
"I'm within my authority, Drummer. Part of the
counter-intelligence function," adding, with a
smirk, "Don't you agree?"

 ##

The utility's approach to the cylindrical Sandbox
closed in on the port side. Brad, at the controls,
increased viewer magnification and inspected the
ship closely. Kumiko, looking at the same image,
reached under Brad's arm and adjusted knobs and
levers, zeroing in on one gun turret after another
along the Sandbox's length. She whistled softly.

"They're loaded for bear," she said. "Circle them,
Brad, let's see what's on the other side."

Brad took the utility around to starboard, then
topside and below.

Scarf again. "OK, you've looked her over. Now,
what's the problem?"

"The ship has four laser-quads and a couple of
explosive decompressors. She's a heavily armed
attack transport, that's all."

"So what? Can you do the job?"

Kumiko looked at Scarf, her normally soft features
twisted, passive but icy. "Oh, yes," she said.
"I can do it. May take a little time, though."

Scarf leaned back.

"Well, let's not fool around with these jokers. If
they don't cooperate, I'm for back to the Dragon
and let our guns talk for us."

"Listen, Scarf," Brad said, exasperated, "our job
is to disable the armament, not destroy the ship.
Also, if you recall, Drummer wants to get through
this exercise without using force. That's why we're
here: to fix the Sandbox so they and any other
ship commanders of like mind won't get ideas
about resisting us. It's a psychological play that will
make the rounds of the Outer as well as the Inner
Region. It's to our advantage to show we do our job
with minimum fuss. So, let's get on with it."

Brad opened the inter-ship comm-line.

"Calling Sandbox. This is Curtin on Dragon Utility
One, approaching from your starboard. Are you
prepared to receive us?"

"Ready," came back. "Your air lock is number 4,
starboard. Go there now. We will extend umbilical
and catwalk as soon as you're matched up."

Brad guided his craft around and along the Sandbox
to a portal bearing a large painted "4." Slowing
the utility, he closed with the Sandbox, gently
fingering controls until they were matched
precisely to the heavy transport's bearing and
drift.

"Now," he said.

Kumiko hit a switch, and the utility beam-anchor
connected to a triangular plate above the airlock,
immobilizing and fixing the utility to the huge
transporter's axis.

The number 4 clamshell panels drew back and
slipped aside. A yellow and white-striped catwalk
snaked out and suckled up to the utility's hatch.

Kumiko took in the overhead dials and lights.

"On track," she said, and after a moment,
"connected and secure."

Brad closed a bank of switches, opened another.
"We'll take no unnecessary chances," he said. "I'm
setting the thruster to cut in at twenty percent
as soon as we're back in and slam the hatch. Five
seconds and into forty, another three and we
go max. That's for just in case. So, if we need
to move fast when we board, hit the accello-nets
pronto. Got it?"

"Right," from Kumiko.

"Scarf?"

"Sure, sure. I got it."

"Next. I want 'em to be able to see that the power
settings on our sidearms are low enough so as
not to kill or cause serious injury. Is that clear?"

"If they start anything, I'd just as soon take a
few of them out for good." Scarf postured his
belligerence.

"Nothing doing, Scarf," Brad shot back. "Using
our weapons on this mission is bound to delay
the schedule, if not much worse. It's been fouled
up already by this little sortie. So don't provoke
'em; set your weapon in the lower levels."

Brad set his weapon at the extreme low setting
and noted that Kumiko did the same. Scarf set
his at the highest level in the non-lethal category,
and with a sneer at Brad, returned the weapon
to its sheath.

Kumiko looked thoughtful. "We should wear suits
while we're on board the Sandbox, Brad," she said.
"It may slow us down a bit, but we'll need to look
at gun emplacements that have minimal air or
none at all."

"Sounds reasonable. OK, keep your suits on."

They rigged their sidearms for control from within
their suits and transferred them to outer sheaths.
They donned the suits, checked each other's suit
security, seal pressure, inter-suit communications,
and reported.

"Move out," Brad said.





 Chapter NINETEEN


The Sandbox's receiving officer observed Brad and
his party's approach through a clear pane in the
air lock's pressurized section. The four husky
deckhands and the officer-in-charge hefted
snub-nosed rifles.

A pressure-suited deckhand responded to Brad's
hand signal that his crew was aboard by conducting
a visual safety check of the ship-to-utility
connections. He turned away, and Brad felt the deck
