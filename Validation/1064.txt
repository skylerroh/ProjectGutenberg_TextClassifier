_By Frank Belknap Long_


Jimmy watched the _Natchez Belle_ draw near, a shining eagerness in his
stare. He stood on the deck of the shantyboat, his toes sticking out of
his socks, his heart knocking against his ribs. Straight down the river
the big packet boat came, purpling the water with its shadow, its
smokestacks belching soot.

Jimmy had a wild talent for collecting things. He knew exactly how to
infuriate the captains without sticking out his neck. Up and down the
Father of Waters, from the bayous of Louisiana to the Great Sandy other
little shantyboat boys envied Jimmy and tried hard to imitate him.

But Jimmy had a very special gift, a genius for pantomime. He'd wait
until there was a glimmer of red flame on the river and small objects
stood out with a startling clarity. Then he'd go into his act.

Nothing upset the captains quite so much as Jimmy's habit of holding a
big, croaking bullfrog up by its legs as the riverboats went steaming
past. It was a surefire way of reminding the captains that men and frogs
were brothers under the skin. The puffed-out throat of the frog told the
captains exactly what Jimmy thought of their cheek.

Jimmy refrained from making faces, or sticking out his tongue at the
grinning roustabouts. It was the frog that did the trick.

In the still dawn things came sailing Jimmy's way, hurled by captains
with a twinkle of repressed merriment dancing in eyes that were kindlier
and more tolerant than Jimmy dreamed.

Just because shantyboat folk had no right to insult the riverboats Jimmy
had collected forty empty tobacco tins, a down-at-heels shoe, a Sears
Roebuck catalogue and--more rolled up newspapers than Jimmy could ever
read.

Jimmy could read, of course. No matter how badly Uncle Al needed a new
pair of shoes, Jimmy's education came first. So Jimmy had spent six
winters ashore in a first-class grammar school, his books paid for out
of Uncle Al's "New Orleans" money.

Uncle Al, blowing on a vinegar jug and making sweet music, the holes in
his socks much bigger than the holes in Jimmy's socks. Uncle Al shaking
his head and saying sadly, "Some day, young fella, I ain't gonna sit
here harmonizing. No siree! I'm gonna buy myself a brand new store suit,
trade in this here jig jug for a big round banjo, and hie myself off to
the Mardi Gras. Ain't too old thataway to git a little fun out of life,
young fella!"

Poor old Uncle Al. The money he'd saved up for the Mardi Gras never
seemed to stretch far enough. There was enough kindness in him to
stretch like a rainbow over the bayous and the river forests of sweet,
rustling pine for as far as the eye could see. Enough kindness to wrap
all of Jimmy's life in a glow, and the life of Jimmy's sister as well.

Jimmy's parents had died of winter pneumonia too soon to appreciate
Uncle Al. But up and down the river everyone knew that Uncle Al was a
great man.
