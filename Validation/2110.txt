Isora been wholly a Spanish girl, she, in all probability, would never
have resisted: so much of custom is there in the very air of a climate.
But she did resist it, partly because she loved me,--and loved me
more and more for our separation,--and partly because she dreaded and
abhorred the ferocious and malignant passions of my rival, far beyond
any other misery with which fortune could threaten her. "Your father
then shall hang or starve!" said Barnard, one day in uncontrollable
frenzy, and left her. He did not appear again at the house. The
Spaniard's resources, fed, probably, alone by Barnard, failed. From
house to house they removed, till they were reduced to that humble one
in which I had found them. There, Barnard again sought them; there,
backed by the powerful advocate of want, he again pressed his suit, and
at that exact moment her father was struck with the numbing curse of his
disease. "There and then," said Isora, candidly, "I might have yielded
at last, for my poor father's sake, if you had not saved me."

Once only (I have before recorded the time) did Barnard visit her in the
new abode I had provided for her, and the day after our conversation on
that event Isora watched and watched for me, and I did not come. From
the woman of the house she at last learned the cause. "I forgot," she
said timidly,--and in conclusion, "I forgot womanhood, and modesty, and
reserve; I forgot the customs of your country, the decencies of my
own; I forgot everything in this world, but you,--you suffering and in
danger; my very sense of existence seemed to pass from me, and to be
supplied by a breathless, confused, and overwhelming sense of impatient
agony, which ceased not till I was in your chamber, and by your side!
And--now, Morton, do not despise me for not having considered more, and
loved you less."

"Despise you!" I murmured, and I threw my arms around her, and drew her
to my breast. I felt her heart beat against my own: those hearts spoke,
though our lips were silent, and in their language seemed to say, "We
are united now, and we will not part."

The starlight, shining with a mellow and deep stillness, was the only
light by which we beheld each other: it shone, the witness and the
sanction of that internal voice, which we owned, but heard not. Our lips
drew closer and closer together, till they met! and in that kiss was the
type and promise of the after ritual which knit two spirits into one.
Silence fell around us like a curtain, and the eternal Night, with her
fresh dews and unclouded stars, looked alone upon the compact of our
hearts,--an emblem of the eternity, the freshness, and the unearthly
though awful brightness of the love which it hallowed and beheld!




BOOK III.



CHAPTER I.

WHEREIN THE HISTORY MAKES GREAT PROGRESS AND IS MARKED BY ONE IMPORTANT
EVENT IN HUMAN LIFE.

SPINOZA is said to have loved, above all other amusements, to put flies
into a spider's web; and the struggles of the imprisoned insects were
wont to bear, in the eyes of this grave philosopher, so facetious and
hilarious an appearance, that he would stand and laugh thereat until the
tears "coursed one another down his innocent nose." Now it so happened
that Spinoza, despite the general (and, in my most meek opinion, the
just) condemnation of his theoretical tenets,* was, in character and
in nature, according to the voices of all who knew him, an exceedingly
kind, humane, and benevolent biped; and it doth, therefore, seem a
little strange unto us grave, sober members of the unphilosophical Many,
that the struggles and terrors of these little winged creatures should
strike the good subtleist in a point of view so irresistibly ludicrous
and delightful. But, for my part, I believe that that most imaginative
and wild speculator beheld in the entangled flies nothing more than a
living simile--an animated illustration--of his own beloved vision
of Necessity; and that he is no more to be considered cruel for the
complacency with which he gazed upon those agonized types of his
system than is Lucan for dwelling with a poet's pleasure upon the many
ingenious ways with which that Grand Inquisitor of Verse has contrived
to vary the simple operation of dying. To the bard, the butchered
soldier was only an epic ornament; to the philosopher, the murdered fly
was only a metaphysical illustration. For, without being a fatalist, or
a disciple of Baruch de Spinoza, I must confess that I cannot conceive
a greater resemblance to our human and earthly state than the penal
predicament of the devoted flies. Suddenly do we find ourselves plunged
into that Vast Web,--the World; and even as the insect, when he first
undergoeth a similar accident of necessity, standeth amazed and
still, and only by little and little awakeneth to a full sense of his
situation; so also at the first abashed and confounded, we remain on the
mesh we are urged upon, ignorant, as yet, of the toils around us,
and the sly, dark, immitigable foe that lieth in yonder nook, already
feasting her imagination upon our destruction. Presently we revive, we
stir, we flutter; and Fate, that foe--the old arch-spider, that hath
no moderation in her maw--now fixeth one of her many eyes upon us, and
giveth us a partial glimpse of her laidly and grim aspect. We pause in
mute terror; we gaze upon the ugly spectre, so imperfectly beheld; the
net ceases to tremble, and the wily enemy draws gently back into her
nook. Now we begin to breathe again; we sound the strange footing on
which we tread; we move tenderly along it, and again the grisly monster
advances on us; again we pause; the foe retires not, but remains still,
and surveyeth us; we see every step is accompanied with danger; we look
round and above in despair; suddenly we feel within us a new impulse and
a new power! we feel a vague sympathy with _that_ unknown region which
spreads beyond this great net,--_that limitless beyond_ hath a mystic
affinity with a part of our own frame; we unconsciously extend our
wings (for the soul to us is as the wings to the fly!); we attempt to
rise,--to soar above this perilous snare, from which we are unable to
crawl. The old spider watcheth us in self-hugging quiet, and, looking
up to our native air, we think,--now shall we escape thee. Out on it!
We rise not a hair's breadth: we have the _wings_, it is true, but the
_feet_ are fettered. We strive desperately again: the whole web vibrates
with the effort; it will break beneath our strength. Not a jot of it!
we cease; we are more entangled than ever! wings, feet, frame, the foul
slime is over all! where shall we turn? every line of the web leads to
the one den,--we know not,--we care not,--we grow blind, confused, lost.
The eyes of our hideous foe gloat upon us; she whetteth her insatiate
maw; she leapeth towards us; she fixeth her fangs upon us; and so endeth
my parallel!


* One ought, however, to be very cautious before one condemns a
philosopher. The master's opinions are generally pure: it is the
conclusions and corollaries of his disciples that "draw the honey forth
that drives men mad." Schlegel seems to have studied Spinoza _de fonte_,
and vindicates him very earnestly from the charges brought against
him,--atheism, etc.--ED.


But what has this to do with my tale? Ay, Reader, that is thy question;
and I will answer it by one of mine. When thou hearest a man moralize
and preach of Fate, art thou not sure that he is going to tell thee of
some one of his peculiar misfortunes? Sorrow loves a parable as much as
mirth loves a jest. And thus already and from afar, I prepare thee, at
the commencement of this, the third of these portions into which the
history of my various and wild life will be divided, for that event with
which I purpose that the said portion shall be concluded.

It is now three months after my entire recovery from my wounds, and I
am married to Isora!--married,--yes, but _privately_ married, and the
ceremony is as yet closely concealed. I will explain.

The moment Isora's anxiety for me led her across the threshold of my
house it became necessary for her honour that our wedding should take
place immediately on my recovery: so far I was decided on the measure;
now for the method. During my illness, I received a long and most
affectionate letter from Aubrey, who was then at Devereux Court: _so_
affectionate was the heart-breathing spirit of that letter, so steeped
in all our old household remembrances and boyish feelings, that coupled
as it was with a certain gloom when he spoke of himself and of worldly
sins and trials, it brought tears to my eyes whenever I recurred to
it; and many and many a time afterwards, when I thought his affections
seemed estranged from me, I did recur to it to convince myself that I
was mistaken. Shortly afterwards I received also a brief epistle from
my uncle; it was as kind as usual, and it mentioned Aubrey's return to
Devereux Court. "That unhappy boy," said Sir William, "is more than ever
devoted to his religious duties; nor do I believe that any priest-ridden
poor devil in the dark ages ever made such use of the scourge and the
penance."

Now, I have before stated that my uncle would, I knew, be averse to
my intended marriage; and on hearing that Aubrey was then with him, I
resolved, in replying to his letter, to entreat the former to sound
Sir William on the subject I had most at heart, and ascertain the exact
nature and extent of the opposition I should have to encounter in the
step I was resolved to take. By the same post I wrote to the good old
knight in as artful a strain as I was able, dwelling at some length upon
my passion, upon the high birth, as well as the numerous good qualities
of the object, but mentioning not her name; and I added everything
that I thought likely to enlist my uncle's kind and warm feelings on my
behalf. These letters produced the following ones:--


FROM SIR WILLIAM DEVEREUX.

'Sdeath, nephew Morton,--but I won't scold thee, though thou deservest
it. Let me see, thou art now scarce twenty, and thou talkest of
marriage, which is the exclusive business of middle age, as familiarly
as "girls of thirteen do of puppy-dogs." Marry!--go hang thyself rather.
Marriage, my dear boy, is at the best a treacherous proceeding; and a
friend--a true friend--will never counsel another to adopt it rashly.
Look you: I have had experience in these matters; and, I think, the
moment a woman is wedded some terrible revolution happens in her system;
all her former good qualities vanish, _hey presto_! like eggs out of a
conjuror's box; 'tis true they appear on t' other side of the box, the
side turned to other people, but for the poor husband they are gone
forever. Ods fish, Morton, go to! I tell thee again that I have had
experience in these matters which thou never hast had, clever as thou
thinkest thyself. If now it were a good marriage thou wert about
to make; if thou wert going to wed power, and money, and places at
court,--why, something might be said for thee. As it is, there is no
excuse--none. And I am astonished how a boy of thy sense could think of
such nonsense. Birth, Morton, what the devil does that signify so long
as it is birth in another country? A foreign damsel, and a Spanish girl,
too, above all others! 'Sdeath, man, as if there was not quicksilver
enough in the English women for you, you must make a mercurial
exportation from Spain, must you! Why, Morton, Morton, the ladies in
that country are proverbial. I tremble at the very thought of it. But as
for my consent, I never will give it,--never; and though I threaten thee
not with disinheritance and such like, yet I do ask something in return
for the great affection I have always borne thee; and I make no doubt
that thou wilt readily oblige me in such a trifle as giving up a mere
Spanish donna. So think of her no more. If thou wantest to make love,
there are ladies in plenty whom thou needest not to marry. And for
my part, I thought that thou wert all in all with the Lady Hasselton:
Heaven bless her pretty face! Now don't think I want to scold thee; and
don't think thine old uncle harsh,--God knows he is not,--but my dear,
dear boy, this is quite out of the question, and thou must let me hear
no more about it. The gout cripples me so that I must leave off. Ever
thine old uncle,

   WILLIAM DEVEREUX.

P. S. Upon consideration, I think, my dear boy, that thou must want
money, and thou art ever too sparing. Messrs. Child, or my goldsmiths
in Aldersgate, have my orders to pay to thy hand's-writing whatever thou
mayst desire; and I do hope that thou wilt now want nothing to make
thee merry withal. Why dost thou not write a comedy? is it not the mode
still?


LETTER FROM AUBREY DEVEREUX.

I have sounded my uncle, dearest Morton, according to your wishes; and I
grieve to say that I have found him inexorable. He was very much hurt by
your letter to him, and declared he should write to you forthwith
upon the subject. I represented to him all that you have said upon the
virtues of your intended bride; and I also insisted upon your clear
judgment and strong sense upon most points being a sufficient surety
for your prudence upon this. But you know the libertine opinions and
the depreciating judgment of women entertained by my poor uncle; and he
would, I believe, have been less displeased with the heinous crime of an
illicit connection than the amiable weakness of an imprudent marriage--I
might say of any marriage--until it was time to provide heirs to the
estate.


Here Aubrey, in the most affectionate and earnest manner, broke off, to
point out to me the extreme danger to my interests that it would be to
disoblige my uncle; who, despite his general kindness, would, upon
a disagreement on so tender a matter as his sore point, and his most
cherished hobby, consider my disobedience as a personal affront. He also
recalled to me all that my uncle had felt and done for me; and insisted,
at all events, upon the absolute duty of my delaying, even though
I should not break off, the intended measure. Upon these points he
enlarged much and eloquently; and this part of his letter certainly left
no cheering or comfortable impression upon my mind.

Now my good uncle knew as much of love as L. Mummius did of the fine
arts,* and it was impossible to persuade him that if one wanted to
indulge the tender passion, one woman would not do exactly as well as
another, provided she were equally pretty. I knew therefore that he was
incapable, on the one hand, of understanding my love for Isora, or, on
the other, of acknowledging her claims upon me. I had not, of course,
mentioned to him the generous imprudence which, on the news of my wound,
had brought Isora to my house: for if I had done so, my uncle, with the
eye of a courtier of Charles II., would only have seen the advantage to
be derived from the impropriety, not the gratitude due to the devotion;
neither had I mentioned this circumstance to Aubrey,--it seemed to me
too delicate for any written communication; and therefore, in his advice
to delay my marriage, he was unaware of the necessity which rendered the
advice unavailing. Now then was I in this dilemma, either to marry, and
that _instanter_, and so, seemingly, with the most hasty and the most
insolent decorum, incense, wound, and in his interpretation of the act,
contemn one whom I loved as I loved my uncle; or, to delay the marriage,
to separate Isora, and to leave my future wife to the malignant
consequences that would necessarily be drawn from a sojourn of weeks
in my house. This fact there was no chance of concealing; servants
have more tongues than Argus had eyes, and my youthful extravagance had
filled my whole house with those pests of society. The latter measure
was impossible, the former was most painful. Was there no third
way?--there was that of a private marriage. This obviated not every
evil; but it removed many: it satisfied my impatient love; it placed
Isora under a sure protection; it secured and established her honour
the moment the ceremony should be declared; and it avoided the seeming
ingratitude and indelicacy of disobeying my uncle, without an effort
of patience to appease him. I should have time and occasion then, I
thought, for soothing and persuading him, and ultimately winning that
consent which I firmly trusted I should sooner or later extract from his
kindness of heart.


* A Roman consul, who, removing the most celebrated remains of Grecian
antiquity to Rome, assured the persons charged with conveying them that,
if they injured any, they should make others to replace them.


That some objections existed to this mediatory plan was true enough:
those objections related to Isora rather than to myself, and she was the
first, on my hinting at the proposal, to overcome its difficulties. The
leading feature in Isora's character was generosity; and, in truth, I
know not a quality more dangerous either to man or woman. Herself was
invariably the last human being whom she seemed to consider; and no
sooner did she ascertain what measure was the most prudent for me to
adopt, than it immediately became that upon which she insisted. Would
it have been possible for me, man of pleasure and of the world as I was
thought to be,--no, my good uncle, though it went to my heart to wound
thee so secretly, it would _not_ have been possible for me, even if I
had not coined my whole nature into love, even if Isora had not been
to me what one smile of Isora's really was,--it would not have been
possible to have sacrificed so noble and so divine a heart, and made
myself, in that sacrifice, a wretch forever. No, my good uncle. I could
not have made that surrender to thy reason, much less to thy prejudices.
But if I have not done great injustice to the knight's character, I
doubt whether the youngest reader will not forgive him for a want of
sympathy with one feeling, when they consider how susceptible that
charming old man was to all others.

And herewith I could discourse most excellent wisdom upon that
mysterious passion of love. I could show, by tracing its causes, and its
inseparable connection with the imagination, that it is only in
certain states of society, as well as in certain periods of life, that
love--real, pure, high love--can be born. Yea, I could prove, to the
nicety of a very problem, that, in the court of Charles II., it would
have been as impossible for such a feeling to find root, as it would be
for myrtle trees to effloresce from a Duvillier periwig. And we are
not to expect a man, however tender and affectionate he may be, to
sympathize with that sentiment in another, which, from the accidents of
birth and position, nothing short of a miracle could have ever produced
in himself.

We were married then in private by a Catholic priest. St. John, and one
old lady who had been my father's godmother--for I wished for a female
assistant in the ceremony, and this old lady could tell no secrets,
for, being excessively deaf, nobody ever talked to her, and indeed she
scarcely ever went abroad--were the sole witnesses. I took a small house
in the immediate neighbourhood of London; it was surrounded on all sides
with a high wall which defied alike curiosity and attack. This was,
indeed, the sole reason which had induced me to prefer it to many more
gaudy or more graceful dwellings. But within I had furnished it with
every luxury that wealth, the most lavish and unsparing, could procure.
Thither, under an assumed name, I brought my bride, and there was the
greater part of my time spent. The people I had placed in the house
believed I was a rich merchant, and this accounted for my frequent
absences (absences which Prudence rendered necessary), for the wealth
which I lavished, and for the precautions of bolt, bar, and wall, which
they imagined the result of commercial caution.

Oh the intoxication of that sweet Elysium, that Tadmor in life's
desert,--the possession of the one whom we have first loved! It is as if
poetry, and music, and light, and the fresh breath of flowers, were all
blended into one being, and from that being rose our existence! It is
content made rapture,--nothing to wish for, yet everything to feel! Was
that air the air which I had breathed hitherto? that earth the earth
which I had hitherto beheld? No, my heart dwelt in a new world, and
all these motley and restless senses were melted into one sense,--deep,
silent, fathomless delight!

Well, too much of this species of love is not fit for a worldly tale,
and I will turn, for the reader's relief, to worldly affections. From
my first reunion with Isora, I had avoided all the former objects and
acquaintances in which my time had been so charmingly employed. Tarleton
was the first to suffer by my new pursuit. "What has altered you?" said
he; "you drink not, neither do you play. The women say you are grown
duller than a Norfolk parson, and neither the Puppet Show nor the Water
Theatre, the Spring Gardens nor the Ring, Wills's nor the Kit Cat, the
Mulberry Garden nor the New Exchange, witness any longer your homage and
devotion. What has come over you?--speak!"

"Apathy!"

"Ah! I understand,--you are tired of these things; pish, man!--go down
into the country, the green fields will revive thee, and send thee back
to London a new man! One would indeed find the town intolerably dull,
if the country were not, happily, a thousand times duller: go to the
country, Count, or I shall drop your friendship."

"Drop it!" said I, yawning, and Tarleton took pet, and did as I desired
him. Now I had got rid of my friend as easily as I had found him,--a
matter that would not have been so readily accomplished had not Mr.
Tarleton owed me certain moneys, concerning which, from the moment he
had "dropped my friendship," good breeding effectually prevented his
saying a single syllable to me ever after. There is no knowing the
blessings of money until one has learned to manage it properly!

So much, then, for the friend; now for the mistress. Lady Hasselton had,
as Tarleton hinted before, resolved to play me a trick of spite; the
reasons of our rupture really were, as I had stated to Tarleton, the
mighty effects of little things. She lived in a sea of trifles, and
she was desperately angry if her lover was not always sailing a
pleasure-boat in the same ocean. Now this was expecting too much from
me, and, after twisting our silken strings of attachment into all manner
of fantastic forms, we fell fairly out one evening and broke the little
ligatures in two. No sooner had I quarrelled with Tarleton than Lady
Hasselton received him in my place, and a week afterwards I was favoured
with an anonymous letter, informing me of the violent passion which a
certain _dame de la cour_ had conceived for me, and requesting me to
meet her at an appointed place. I looked twice over the letter, and
discovered in one corner of it two _g's_ peculiar to the caligraphy of
Lady Hasselton, though the rest of the letter (bad spelling excepted)
was pretty decently disguised. Mr. Fielding was with me at the time.
"What disturbs you?" said he, adjusting his knee-buckles.

"Read it!" said I, handing him the letter.

"Body of me, you are a lucky dog!" cried the beau. "You will hasten
thither on the wings of love."

"Not a whit of it," said I; "I suspect that it comes from a rich old
widow whom I hate mortally."

"A rich old widow!" repeated Mr. Fielding, to whose eyes there was
something very piquant in a jointure, and who thought consequently that
there were few virginal flowers equal to a widow's weeds. "A rich old
widow: you are right, Count, you are right. Don't go, don't think of
it. I cannot abide those depraved creatures. Widow, indeed,--quite an
affront to your gallantry."

"Very true," said I. "Suppose you supply my place?"

"I'd sooner be shot first," said Mr. Fielding, taking his departure, and
begging me for the letter to wrap some sugar plums in.

Need I add, that Mr. Fielding repaired to the place of assignation,
where he received, in the shape of a hearty drubbing, the kind favours
intended for me? The story was now left for me to tell, not for the Lady
Hasselton; and that makes all the difference in the manner a story is
told,--_me_ narrante, it is de _te_ fabula narratur; _te_ narrante, and
it is de _me_ fabula, etc. Poor Lady Hasselton! to be laughed at, and
have Tarleton for a lover!

I have gone back somewhat in the progress of my history in order to make
the above honourable mention of my friend and my mistress, thinking
it due to their own merits, and thinking it may also be instructive to
young gentlemen who have not yet seen the world to testify the exact
nature and the probable duration of all the loves and friendships they
are likely to find in that Great Monmouth Street of glittering and of
damaged affections! I now resume the order of narration.

I wrote to Aubrey, thanking him for his intercession, but concealing,
till we met, the measure I had adopted. I wrote also to my uncle,
assuring him that I would take an early opportunity of hastening to
Devereux Court, and conversing with him on the subject of his letter.
And after an interval of some weeks, I received the two following
answers from my correspondents; the latter arrived several days after
the former:--


FROM AUBREY DEVEREUX.

I am glad to understand from your letter, unexplanatory as it is, that
you have followed my advice. I will shortly write to you more at large;
at present I am on the eve of my departure for the North of England, and
have merely time to assure you of my affection.

   AUBREY DEVEREUX.

P. S. Gerald is in London; have you seen him? Oh, this world! this
world! how it clings to us, despite our education, our wishes, our
conscience, our knowledge of the Dread Hereafter!


LETTER FROM SIR WILLIAM DEVEREUX.

MY DEAR NEPHEW,--Thank thee for thy letter, and the new plays thou
sentest me down, and that droll new paper, the "Spectator:" it is a
pretty shallow thing enough,--though it is not so racy as Rochester or
little Sid would have made it; but I thank thee for it, because it shows
thou wast not angry with thine old uncle for opposing thee on thy love
whimsies (in which most young men are dreadfully obstinate), since thou
didst provide so kindly for his amusement. Well, but, Morton, I hope
thou hast got that crotchet clear out of thy mind, and prithee now
_don't_ talk of it when thou comest down to see me. I hate conversations
on marriage more than a boy does flogging,--ods fish, I do. So you must
humour me on that point!

Aubrey has left me again, and I am quite alone,--not that I was much
better off when he was here, for he was wont, of late, to shun my poor
room like a "lazar house," and when I spoke to his mother about it, she
muttered something about "example" and "corrupting." 'Sdeath, Morton, is
your old uncle, who loves all living things, down to poor Ponto the dog,
the sort of man whose example corrupts youth? As for thy mother, she
grows more solitary every day; and I don't know how it is, but I am not
so fond of strange faces as I used to be. 'Tis a new thing for me to
be avoided and alone. Why, I remember even little Sid, who had as much
venom as most men, once said it was impossible to--Fie now--see if I was
not going to preach a sermon from a text in favour of myself! But come,
Morton, come, I long for your face again: it is not so soft as Aubrey's,
nor so regular as Gerald's; but it is twice as kind as either. Come,
before it is too late: I feel myself going; and, to tell thee a secret,
the doctors tell me I may not last many months longer. Come, and laugh
once more at the old knight's stories. Come, and show him that there is
still some one not too good to love him. Come, and I will tell thee a
famous thing of old Rowley, which I am too ill and too sad to tell thee
now.

   WM. DEVEREUX.


Need I say that, upon receiving this letter, I resolved, without any
delay, to set out for Devereux Court? I summoned Desmarais to me; he
answered not my call: he was from home,--an unfrequent occurrence with
the necessitarian valet. I waited his return, which was not for
some hours, in order to give him sundry orders for my departure. The
exquisite Desmarais hemmed thrice,--"Will Monsieur be so very kind as
to excuse my accompanying him?" said he, with his usual air and tone of
obsequious respect.

"And why?" The valet explained. A relation of his was in England only
for a few days: the philosopher was most anxious to enjoy his society, a
pleasure which fate might not again allow him.

Though I had grown accustomed to the man's services, and did not like
to lose him even for a time, yet I could not refuse his request; and
I therefore ordered another of my servants to supply his place. This
change, however, determined me to adopt a plan which I had before
meditated; namely, the conveying of my own person to Devereux Court on
horseback, and sending my servant with my luggage in my post-chaise.
The equestrian mode of travelling is, indeed to this day, the one most
pleasing to me; and the reader will find me pursuing it many years
afterwards, and to the same spot.

I might as well observe here that I had never intrusted Desmarais--no,
nor one of my own servants--with the secret of my marriage with, or my
visits to, Isora. I am a very fastidious person on those matters; and
of all confidants, even in the most trifling affairs, I do most eschew
those by whom we have the miserable honour of being served.

In order, then, to avoid having my horse brought me to Isora's house by
any of these menial spies, I took the steed which I had selected for my
journey, and rode to Isora's with the intention of spending the evening
there, and thence commencing my excursion with the morning light.



CHAPTER II.

LOVE; PARTING; A DEATH-BED.--AFTER ALL HUMAN NATURE IS A BEAUTIFUL
FABRIC; AND EVEN ITS IMPERFECTIONS ARE NOT ODIOUS TO HIM WHO HAS STUDIED
THE SCIENCE OF ITS ARCHITECTURE, AND FORMED A REVERENT ESTIMATE OF ITS
CREATOR.

IT is a noticeable thing how much fear increases love. I mean--for the
aphorism requires explanation--how much we love in proportion to our
fear of losing (or even to our fear of injury done to) the beloved
object. 'Tis an instance of the reaction of the feelings: the love
produces the fear, and the fear reproduces the love. This is one reason,
among many, why women love so much more tenderly and anxiously than we
do; and it is also one reason among many why frequent absences are,
in all stages of love, the most keen exciters of the passion. I never
breathed, away from Isora, without trembling for her safety. I trembled
lest this Barnard, if so I should still continue to call her persecutor,
should again discover and again molest her. Whenever (and that was
almost daily) I rode to the quiet and remote dwelling I had procured
her, my heart beat so vehemently, and my agitation was so intense,
that on arriving at the gate I have frequently been unable, for several
minutes, to demand admittance. There was, therefore, in the mysterious
danger which ever seemed to hang over Isora, a perpetual irritation to
a love otherwise but little inclined to slumber; and this constant
excitement took away from the torpor into which domestic affection too
often languishes, and increased my passion even while it diminished my
happiness.

On my arrival now at Isora's, I found her already stationed at the
window, watching for my coming. How her dark eyes lit into lustre when
they saw me! How the rich blood mantled up under the soft cheek which
feeling had refined of late into a paler hue than it was wont, when I
first gazed upon it, to wear! Then how sprang forth her light step to
meet me! How trembled her low voice to welcome me! How spoke, from
every gesture of her graceful form, the anxious, joyful, all-animating
gladness of her heart! It is a melancholy pleasure to the dry, harsh
afterthoughts of later life, to think one has been thus loved; and one
marvels, when one considers what one is now, how it could have ever
been! That love _of ours_ was never made for after years! It could never
have flowed into the common and cold channel of ordinary affairs! It
could never have been mingled with the petty cares and the low objects
with which the loves of all who live long together in this sordid and
most earthly earth are sooner or later blended! We could not have spared
to others an atom of the great wealth of our affection. We were misers
of every coin in that boundless treasury. It would have pierced me to
the soul to have seen Isora smile upon another. I know not even, had we
had children, if I should not have been jealous of my child! Was this
selfish love? yes, it was, intensely, wholly selfish; but it was a love
made so only by its excess; nothing selfish on a smaller scale polluted
it. There was not on earth that which the one would not have forfeited
at the lightest desire of the other. So utterly were happiness and Isora
entwined together that I could form no idea of the one with which the
other was not connected. Was this love made for the many and miry roads
through which man must travel? Was it made for age, or, worse than age,
for those cool, ambitious, scheming years that we call mature, in which
all the luxuriance and verdure of things are pared into tame shapes that
mimic life, but a life that is estranged from Nature, in which art
is the only beauty and regularity the only grace? No, in my heart
of hearts, I feel that our love was not meant for the stages of life
through which I have already passed; it would have made us miserable to
see it fritter itself away, and to remember what it once was. Better
as it is! better to mourn over the green bough than to look upon the
sapless stem. You who now glance over these pages, are you a mother? If
so, answer me one question: Would you not rather that the child whom
you have cherished with your soul's care, whom you have nurtured at
your bosom, whose young joys your eyes have sparkled to behold, whose
lightest grief you have wept to witness as you would have wept not for
your own; over whose pure and unvexed sleep you have watched and prayed,
and, as it lay before you thus still and unconscious of your vigil, have
shaped out, oh, such bright hopes for its future lot,--would you not
rather that while thus young and innocent, not a care tasted, not a
crime incurred, it went down at once into the dark grave? Would you
not rather suffer this grief, bitter though it be, than watch the
predestined victim grow and ripen, and wind itself more and more around
your heart, and when it is of full and mature age, and you yourself are
stricken by years, and can form no new ties to replace the old that are
severed, when woes have already bowed the darling of your hope, whom woe
never was to touch, when sins have already darkened the bright, seraph,
unclouded heart which sin never was to dim,--behold it sink day by day
altered, diseased, decayed, into the tomb which its childhood had in
vain escaped? Answer me: would not the earlier fate be far gentler than
the last? And if you _have_ known and wept over that early tomb, if
you have seen the infant flower fade away from the green soil of your
affections; if you have missed the bounding step, and the laughing
eye, and the winning mirth which made this sterile world a perpetual
holiday,--Mother of the Lost, if you have known, and you still pine for
these, answer me yet again! Is it not a comfort, even while you mourn,
to think of all that that breast, now so silent, has escaped? The cream,
the sparkle, the elixir of life, it had already quaffed: is it not sweet
to think it shunned the wormwood and the dregs? Answer me, even though
the answer be in tears! Mourner, your child was to you what my early and
only love was to me; and could you pierce down, down through a thousand
fathom of ebbing thought, to the far depths of my heart, you would there
behold a sorrow _and a consolation_ that have something in unison with
your own!

When the light of the next morning broke into our room, Isora was still
sleeping. Have you ever observed that the young, seen asleep and by the
morning light, seem much younger even than they are? partly because the
air and the light sleep of dawn bring a fresher bloom to the cheek,
and partly, because the careless negligence and the graceful postures
exclusively appropriated to youth, are forbidden by custom and formality
through the day, and developing themselves unconsciously in sleep, they
strike the eye like the ease and freedom of childhood itself. There,
as I looked upon Isora's tranquil and most youthful beauty, over which
circled and breathed an ineffable innocence,--even as the finer and
subtler air, which was imagined by those dreamy bards who kindled the
soft creations of naiad and of nymph, to float around a goddess,--I
could not believe that aught evil awaited one for whom infancy itself
