APPENDIX


ELECTROLYTIC DISSOCIATION THEORY

The following brief statements concerning the ionic theory and a few
of its applications are intended for reference in connection with the
explanations which are given in the Notes accompanying the various
procedures. The reader who desires a more extended discussion of the
fundamental theory and its uses is referred to such books as Talbot
and Blanchard's !Electrolytic Dissociation Theory! (Macmillan
Company), or Alexander Smith's !Introduction to General Inorganic
Chemistry! (Century Company).

The !electrolytic dissociation theory!, as propounded by Arrhenius in
1887, assumes that acids, bases, and salts (that is, electrolytes)
in aqueous solution are dissociated to a greater or less extent into
!ions!. These ions are assumed to be electrically charged atoms or
groups of atoms, as, for example, H^{+} and Br^{-} from hydrobromic
acid, Na^{+} and OH^{-} from sodium hydroxide, 2NH_{4}^{+} and
SO_{4}^{--} from ammonium sulphate. The unit charge is that which is
dissociated with a hydrogen ion. Those upon other ions vary in sign
and number according to the chemical character and valence of the
atoms or radicals of which the ions are composed. In any solution the
aggregate of the positive charges upon the positive ions (!cations!)
must always balance the aggregate negative charges upon the negative
ions (!anions!).

It is assumed that the Na^{+} ion, for example, differs from the
sodium atom in behavior because of the very considerable electrical
charge which it carries and which, as just stated, must, in an
electrically neutral solution, be balanced by a corresponding negative
charge on some other ion. When an electric current is passed through a
solution of an electrolyte the ions move with and convey the current,
and when the cations come into contact with the negatively charged
cathode they lose their charges, and the resulting electrically
neutral atoms (or radicals) are liberated as such, or else enter at
once into chemical reaction with the components of the solution.

Two ions of identically the same composition but with different
