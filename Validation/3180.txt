 _The body tanks had to be replenished and the ship had to
 be serviced--and the crew was having a Lotus dream in its
 bed of protoplasm. But Kelly knew how to arouse them...._


       _Has Anybody
         Here Seen
          Kelly?_

The Crew pulsed with contentment, and its communal singing brought a
pleasant kind of glow that throbbed gently in the control room.

"'Has anybody here seen Kelly ... K-E-double-L-Y?'"

"Shut up and dig my thought!" Kelly's stubborn will insisted. "I'm going
on out for a while!"

The delicate loom of the Crew's light pattern increased its frequency a
little and the song stopped. "Better not," the Crew said.

"But why not?"

"No need."

"We could be running into something bad," Kelly thought.

"No danger now, Kelly. Checking the ship is just a waste of time."

"How can you waste what you have so damn much of?" Kelly thought.

"Do not leave us again, Kelly. We love you and you are the most
interesting part of the Crew when you're with it."

"The ship ought to be checked. Our bodies ought to be looked at."

"We know there is no danger any more, Kelly. Do not go. There are so
many interesting experiences we have not even begun to share yet. We are
only half way through your life and we have not even started to
experience your impressions of your colorful and complex Earth culture.
And we have not even started on the adult lives of Lakrit or Lljub. Come
back with your Crew, Kelly."

"But no one's checked the ship for over a year!"
