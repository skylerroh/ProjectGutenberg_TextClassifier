of having left it with emptied pockets."

"Pshaw, man!" said Lord Dalgarno, "I spoke but according to the trick of
the time; besides, a man must set a piece or two sometimes, or he would
be held a cullionly niggard. But here comes dinner, and we will
see whether you like the Chevalier's good cheer better than his
conversation."

Dinner was announced accordingly, and the two friends, being seated in
the most honourable station at the board, were ceremoniously attended
to by the Chevalier, who did the honours of his table to them and to the
other guests, and seasoned the whole with his agreeable conversation.
The dinner was really excellent, in that piquant style of cookery which
the French had already introduced, and which the home-bred young men of
England, when they aspired to the rank of connoisseurs and persons of
taste, were under the necessity of admiring. The wine was also of the
first quality, and circulated in great variety, and no less abundance.
The conversation among so many young men was, of course, light, lively,
and amusing; and Nigel, whose mind had been long depressed by anxiety
and misfortune, naturally found himself at ease, and his spirits raised
and animated.

Some of the company had real wit, and could use it both politely and to
advantage; others were coxcombs, and were laughed at without discovering
it; and, again, others were originals, who seemed to have no objection
that the company should be amused with their folly instead of their
wit. And almost all the rest who played any prominent part in the
conversation had either the real tone of good society which belonged to
the period, or the jargon which often passes current for it.

In short, the company and conversation was so agreeable, that Nigel's
rigour was softened by it, even towards the master of ceremonies, and
he listened with patience to various details which the Chevalier de
Beaujeu, seeing, as he said, that Milor's taste lay for the "curieux
and Futile," chose to address to him in particular, on the subject of
cookery. To gratify, at the same time, the taste for antiquity, which
he somehow supposed that his new guest possessed, he launched out in
commendation of the great artists of former days, particularly one
whom he had known in his youth, "Maitre de Cuisine to the Marechal
Strozzi--tres bon gentilhomme pourtant;" who had maintained his master's
table with twelve covers every day during the long and severe blockade
of le petit Leyth, although he had nothing better to place on it than
the quarter of a carrion-horse now and then, and the grass and weeds
that grew on the ramparts. "Despardieux c'dtoit un homme superbe!" With
one tistle-head, and a nettle or two, he could make a soupe for twenty
guests--an haunch of a little puppy-dog made a roti des plus excellens;
but his coupe de maitre was when the rendition--what you call the
surrender, took place and appened; and then, dieu me damme, he made out
of the hind quarter of one salted horse, forty-five couverts; that the
English and Scottish officers and nobility, who had the honour to dine
with Monseigneur upon the rendition, could not tell what the devil any
of them were made upon at all.

The good wine had by this time gone so merrily round, and had such
genial effect on the guests, that those of the lower end of the table,
who had hitherto been listeners, began, not greatly to their own credit,
or that of the ordinary, to make innovations.

"You speak of the siege of Leith," said a tall, raw-boned man, with
thick mustaches turned up with a military twist, a broad buff belt, a
long rapier, and other outward symbols of the honoured profession, which
lives by killing other people--"you talk of the siege of Leith, and I
have seen the place--a pretty kind of a hamlet it is, with a plain wall,
or rampart, and a pigeon-house or so of a tower at every angle. Uds
daggers and scabbards, if a leaguer of our days had been twenty-four
hours, not to say so many months, before it, without carrying the place
and all its cocklofts, one after another, by pure storm, they would have
deserved no better grace than the Provost-Marshal gives when his noose
is reeved."

"Saar," said the Chevalier, "Monsieur le Capitaine, I vas not at
the siege of the petit Leyth, and I know not what you say about the
cockloft; but I will say for Monseigneur de Strozzi, that he understood
the grande guerre, and was grand capitaine--plus grand--that is more
great, it may be, than some of the capitaines of Angleterre, who do
speak very loud--tenez, Monsieur, car c'est a vous!"

"O Monsieur." answered the swordsman, "we know the Frenchman will fight
well behind his barrier of stone, or when he is armed with back, breast,
and pot."

"Pot!" exclaimed the Chevalier, "what do you mean by pot--do you mean to
insult me among my noble guests? Saar, I have done my duty as a pauvre
gentilhomme under the Grand Henri Quatre, both at Courtrai and Yvry,
and, ventre saint gris! we had neither pot nor marmite, but did always
charge in our shirt."

"Which refutes another base scandal," said Lord Dalgarno, laughing,
"alleging that linen was scarce among the French gentlemen-at-arms."

"Gentlemen out at arms and elbows both, you mean, my lord," said the
captain, from the bottom of the table. "Craving your lordship's pardon,
I do know something of these same gens-d'armes."

"We will spare your knowledge at present, captain, and save your modesty
at the same time the trouble of telling us how that knowledge was
acquired," answered Lord Dalgarno, rather contemptuously.

"I need not speak of it, my lord," said the man of war; "the world knows
it--all perhaps, but the men of mohair--the poor sneaking citizens of
London, who would see a man of valour eat his very hilts for hunger, ere
they would draw a farthing from their long purses to relieve them. O,
if a band of the honest fellows I have seen were once to come near that
cuckoo's nest of theirs!"

"A cuckoo's nest!-and that said of the city of London!" said a gallant
who sat on the opposite side of the table, and who, wearing a splendid
and fashionable dress, seemed yet scarce at home in it--"I will not
brook to hear that repeated."

"What!" said the soldier, bending a most terrific frown from a pair of
broad black eyebrows, handling the hilt of his weapon with one hand, and
twirling with the other his huge mustaches; "will you quarrel for your
city?"

"Ay, marry will I," replied the other. "I am a citizen, I care not who
knows it; and he who shall speak a word in dispraise of the city, is an
ass and a peremptory gull, and I will break his pate, to teach him sense
and manners."

The company, who probably had their reasons for not valuing the
captain's courage at the high rate which he himself put upon it, were
much entertained at the manner in which the quarrel was taken up by
the indignant citizen; and they exclaimed on all sides, "Well run,
Bow-bell!"--"Well crowed, the cock of Saint Paul's!"--"Sound a charge
there, or the soldier will mistake his signals, and retreat when he
should advance."

"You mistake me, gentlemen," said the captain, looking round with an
air of dignity. "I will but inquire whether this cavaliero citizen is
of rank and degree fitted to measure swords with a man of action; (for,
conceive me, gentlemen, it is not with every one that I can match myself
without loss of reputation;) and in that case he shall soon hear from me
honourably, by way of cartel."

"You shall feel me most dishonourably in the way of cudgel," said the
citizen, starting up, and taking his sword, which he had laid in a
corner. "Follow me."

"It is my right to name the place of combat, by all the rules of
the sword," said the captain; "and I do nominate the Maze, in
Tothill-Fields, for place--two gentlemen, who shall be indifferent
judges, for witnesses;--and for time--let me say this day fortnight, at
daybreak."

"And I," said the citizen, "do nominate the bowling-alley behind the
house for place, the present good company for witnesses, and for time
the present moment."

So saying, he cast on his beaver, struck the soldier across the
shoulders with his sheathed sword, and ran down stairs. The captain
showed no instant alacrity to follow him; yet, at last, roused by the
laugh and sneer around him, he assured the company, that what he did he
would do deliberately, and, assuming his hat, which he put on with the
air of Ancient Pistol, he descended the stairs to the place of combat,
where his more prompt adversary was already stationed, with his sword
unsheathed. Of the company, all of whom seemed highly delighted with
the approaching fray, some ran to the windows which overlooked the
bowling-alley, and others followed the combatants down stairs. Nigel
could not help asking Dalgarno whether he would not interfere to prevent
mischief.

"It would be a crime against the public interest," answered his friend;
"there can no mischief happen between two such originals, which will not
be a positive benefit to society, and particularly to the Chevalier's
establishment, as he calls it. I have been as sick of that captain's
buff belt, and red doublet, for this month past, as e'er I was of aught;
and now I hope this bold linendraper will cudgel the ass out of that
filthy lion's hide. See, Nigel, see the gallant citizen has ta'en his
ground about a bowl's-cast forward, in the midst of the alley--the very
model of a hog in armour. Behold how he prances with his manly foot, and
brandishes his blade, much as if he were about to measure forth cambric
with it. See, they bring on the reluctant soldado, and plant him
opposite to his fiery antagonist, twelve paces still dividing them--Lo,
the captain draws his tool, but, like a good general, looks over his
shoulder to secure his retreat, in case the worse come on't. Behold the
valiant shop-keeper stoops his head, confident, doubtless, in the civic
helmet with which his spouse has fortified his skull--Why, this is the
rarest of sport. By Heaven, he will run a tilt at him, like a ram."

It was even as Lord Dalgarno had anticipated; for the citizen, who
seemed quite serious in his zeal for combat, perceiving that the man
of war did not advance towards him, rushed onwards with as much good
fortune as courage, beat down the captain's guard, and, pressing
on, thrust, as it seemed, his sword clear through the body of his
antagonist, who, with a deep groan, measured his length on the ground.
A score of voices cried to the conqueror, as he stood fixed in
astonishment at his own feat, "Away, away with you!--fly, fly--fly by
the back door!--get into the Whitefriars, or cross the water to the
Bankside, while we keep off the mob and the constables." And
the conqueror, leaving his vanquished foeman on the ground, fled
accordingly, with all speed.

"By Heaven," said Lord Dalgarno, "I could never have believed that
the fellow would have stood to receive a thrust--he has certainly been
arrested by positive terror, and lost the use of his limbs. See, they
are raising him."

Stiff and stark seemed the corpse of the swordsman, as one or two of
the guests raised him from the ground; but, when they began to open his
waistcoat to search for the wound which nowhere existed, the man of war
collected, his scattered spirits; and, conscious that the ordinary was
no longer a stage on which to display his valour, took to his heels as
fast as he could run, pursued by the laughter and shouts of the company.

"By my honour," said Lord Dalgarno, "he takes the same course with his
conqueror. I trust in heaven he will overtake him, and then the valiant
citizen will suppose himself haunted by the ghost of him he has slain."

"Despardieux, milor," said the Chevalier, "if he had stayed one moment,
he should have had a _torchon_--what you call a dishclout, pinned to him
for a piece of shroud, to show he be de ghost of one grand fanfaron."

"In the meanwhile," said Lord Dalgarno, "you will oblige us, Monsieur le
Chevalier, as well as maintain your own honoured reputation, by letting
your drawers receive the man-at-arms with a cudgel, in case he should
venture to come way again."

"Ventre saint gris, milor," said the Chevalier, "leave that to
me.--Begar, the maid shall throw the wash-sud upon the grand poltron!"

When they had laughed sufficiently at this ludicrous occurrence, the
party began to divide themselves into little knots--some took possession
of the alley, late the scene of combat, and put the field to its proper
use of a bowling-ground, and it soon resounded with all the terms of the
game, as "run, run-rub, rub--hold bias, you infernal trundling timber!"
thus making good the saying, that three things are thrown away in a
bowling-green, namely, time, money, and oaths. In the house, many of the
gentlemen betook themselves to cards or dice, and parties were formed at
Ombre, at Basset, at Gleek, at Primero, and other games then in fashion;
while the dice were used at various games, both with and without the
tables, as Hazard, In-and-in, Passage, and so forth. The play, however,
did not appear to be extravagantly deep; it was certainly conducted with
great decorum and fairness; nor did there appear any thing to lead the
young Scotsman in the least to doubt his companion's assurance, that
the place was frequented by men of rank and quality, and that the
recreations they adopted were conducted upon honourable principles.

Lord Dalgarno neither had proposed play to his friend, nor joined in the
amusement himself, but sauntered from one table to another, remarking
the luck of the different players, as well as their capacity to avail
themselves of it, and exchanging conversation with the highest and most
respectable of the guests. At length, as if tired of what in modern
phrase would have been termed lounging, he suddenly remembered that
Burbage was to act Shakespeare's King Richard, at the Fortune, that
afternoon, and that he could not give a stranger in London, like
Lord Glenvarloch, a higher entertainment than to carry him to that
exhibition; "unless, indeed," he added, in a whisper, "there is paternal
interdiction of the theatre as well as of the ordinary."

"I never heard my father speak of stage-plays," said Lord Glenvarloch,
"for they are shows of a modern date, and unknown in Scotland. Yet, if
what I have heard to their prejudice be true, I doubt much whether he
would have approved of them."

"Approved of them!" exclaimed Lord Dalgarno--"why, George Buchanan wrote
tragedies, and his pupil, learned and wise as himself, goes to see
them, so it is next door to treason to abstain; and the cleverest men in
England write for the stage, and the prettiest women in London resort to
the playhouses, and I have a brace of nags at the door which will
carry us along the streets like wild-fire, and the ride will digest our
venison and ortolans, and dissipate the fumes of the wine, and so let's
to horse--Godd'en to you, gentlemen--Godd'en, Chevalier de la Fortune."

Lord Dalgarno's grooms were in attendance with two horses, and the young
men mounted, the proprietor upon a favourite barb, and Nigel upon a
high-dressed jennet, scarce less beautiful. As they rode towards the
theatre, Lord Dalgarno endeavoured to discover his friend's opinion of
the company to which he had introduced him, and to combat the exceptions
which he might suppose him to have taken. "And wherefore lookest thou
sad," he said, "my pensive neophyte? Sage son of the Alma Mater of
Low-Dutch learning, what aileth thee? Is the leaf of the living world
which we have turned over in company, less fairly written than thou
hadst been taught to expect? Be comforted, and pass over one little blot
or two; thou wilt be doomed to read through many a page, as black as
Infamy, with her sooty pinion, can make them. Remember, most immaculate
Nigel, that we are in London, not Leyden--that we are studying life, not
lore. Stand buff against the reproach of thine over-tender conscience,
man, and when thou summest up, like a good arithmetician, the actions
of the day, before you balance the account on your pillow, tell the
accusing spirit, to his brimstone beard, that if thine ears have heard
the clatter of the devil's bones, thy hand hath not trowled them--that
if thine eye hath seen the brawling of two angry boys, thy blade hath
not been bared in their fray."

"Now, all this may be wise and witty," replied Nigel; "yet I own I
cannot think but that your lordship, and other men of good quality
with whom we dined, might have chosen a place of meeting free from the
intrusion of bullies, and a better master of your ceremonial than yonder
foreign adventurer."

"All shall be amended, Sancte Nigelle, when thou shalt come forth a
new Peter the Hermit, to preach a crusade against dicing, drabbing, and
company-keeping. We will meet for dinner in Saint Sepulchre's Church;
we will dine in the chancel, drink our flask in the vestry, the parson
shall draw every cork, and the clerk say amen to every health. Come man,
cheer up, and get rid of this sour and unsocial humour. Credit me, that
the Puritans who object to us the follies and the frailties incident to
human nature, have themselves the vices of absolute devils, privy malice
and backbiting hypocrisy, and spiritual pride in all its presumption.
There is much, too, in life which we must see, were it only to learn to
shun it. Will Shakespeare, who lives after death, and who is presently
to afford thee such pleasure as none but himself can confer, has
described the gallant Falconbridge as calling that man

  ----' a bastard to the time,
  That doth not smack of observation;
  Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
  Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn."

But here we are at the door of the Fortune, where we shall have
matchless Will speaking for himself.--Goblin, and you other lout, leave
the horses to the grooms, and make way for us through the press."

They dismounted, and the assiduous efforts of Lutin, elbowing, bullying,
and proclaiming his master's name and title, made way through a crowd of
murmuring citizens, and clamorous apprentices, to the door, where Lord
Dalgarno speedily procured a brace of stools upon the stage for his
companion and himself, where, seated among other gallants of the same
class, they had an opportunity of displaying their fair dresses
and fashionable manners, while they criticised the piece during its
progress; thus forming, at the same time, a conspicuous part of the
spectacle, and an important proportion of the audience.

Nigel Olifaunt was too eagerly and deeply absorbed in the interest of
the scene, to be capable of playing his part as became the place
where he was seated. He felt all the magic of that sorcerer, who had
displayed, within the paltry circle of a wooden booth, the long wars of
York and Lancaster, compelling the heroes of either line to stalk across
the scene in language and fashion as they lived, as if the grave had
given up the dead for the amusement and instruction of the living.
Burbage, esteemed the best Richard until Garrick arose, played the
tyrant and usurper with such truth and liveliness, that when the Battle
of Bosworth seemed concluded by his death, the ideas of reality and
deception were strongly contending in Lord Glenvarloch's imagination,
and it required him to rouse himself from his reverie, so strange did
the proposal at first sound when his companion declared King Richard
should sup with them at the Mermaid.

They were joined, at the same time, by a small party of the gentlemen
with whom they had dined, which they recruited by inviting two or three
of the most accomplished wits and poets, who seldom failed to attend
the Fortune Theatre, and were even but too ready to conclude a day of
amusement with a night of pleasure. Thither the whole party adjourned,
and betwixt fertile cups of sack, excited spirits, and the emulous wit
of their lively companions, seemed to realise the joyous boast of one of
Ben Jonson's contemporaries, when reminding the bard of

            "Those lyric feasts,
     Where men such clusters had,
     As made them nobly wild, not mad;
     While yet each verse of thine
     Outdid the meat, outdid the frolic wine."




CHAPTER XIII


    Let the proud salmon gorge the feather'd hook,
    Then strike, and then you have him--He will wince;
    Spin out your line that it shall whistle from you
    Some twenty yards or so, yet you shall have him--
    Marry! you must have patience--the stout rock
    Which is his trust, hath edges something sharp;
    And the deep pool hath ooze and sludge enough
    To mar your fishing--'less you are more careful.
                _Albion, or the Double Kings._

It is seldom that a day of pleasure, upon review, seems altogether
so exquisite as the partaker of the festivity may have felt it while
passing over him. Nigel Olifaunt, at least, did not feel it so, and it
required a visit from his new acquaintance, Lord Dalgarno, to reconcile
him entirely to himself. But this visit took place early after
breakfast, and his friend's discourse was prefaced with a question, How
he liked the company of the preceding evening?

"Why, excellently well," said Lord Glenvarloch; "only I should have
liked the wit better had it appeared to flow more freely. Every man's
invention seemed on the stretch, and each extravagant simile seemed to
set one half of your men of wit into a brown study to produce something
which should out-herod it."

"And wherefore not?" said Lord Dalgarno, "or what are these fellows fit
for, but to play the intellectual gladiators before us? He of them who
declares himself recreant, should, d--n him, be restricted to muddy ale,
and the patronage of the Waterman's Company. I promise you, that many a
pretty fellow has been mortally wounded with a quibble or a carwitchet
at the Mermaid, and sent from thence, in a pitiable estate, to Wit's
hospital in the Vintry, where they languish to this day amongst fools
and aldermen."

"It may be so," said Lord Nigel; "yet I could swear by my honour, that
last night I seemed to be in company with more than one man whose genius
and learning ought either to have placed him higher in our company, or
to have withdrawn him altogether from a scene, where, sooth to speak,
his part seemed unworthily subordinate."

"Now, out upon your tender conscience," said Lord Dalgarno; "and the
fico for such outcasts of Parnassus! Why, these are the very leavings of
that noble banquet of pickled herrings and Rhenish, which lost London
so many of her principal witmongers and bards of misrule. What would you
have said had you seen Nash or Green, when you interest yourself about
the poor mimes you supped with last night? Suffice it, they had their
drench and their doze, and they drank and slept as much as may save
them from any necessity of eating till evening, when, if they are
industrious, they will find patrons or players to feed them. [Footnote:
The condition of men of wit and talents was never more melancholy than
about this period. Their lives were so irregular, and their means of
living so precarious, that they were alternately rioting in debauchery,
or encountering and struggling with the meanest necessities. Two or
three lost their lives by a surfeit brought on by that fatal banquet of
Rhenish wine and pickled herrings, which is familiar to those who
study the lighter literature of that age. The whole history is a most
melancholy picture of genius, degraded at once by its own debaucheries,
and the patronage of heartless rakes and profligates.] For the rest of
their wants, they can be at no loss for cold water while the New
River head holds good; and your doublets of Parnassus are eternal in
duration."

"Virgil and Horace had more efficient patronage," said Nigel.

"Ay," replied his countryman, "but these fellows are neither Virgil nor
Horace; besides, we have other spirits of another sort, to whom I will
introduce you on some early occasion. Our Swan of Avon hath sung his
last; but we have stout old Ben, with as much learning and genius as
ever prompted the treader of sock and buskin. It is not, however, of
him I mean now to speak; but I come to pray you, of dear love, to row up
with me as far as Richmond, where two or three of the gallants whom you
saw yesterday, mean to give music and syllabubs to a set of beauties,
with some curious bright eyes among them--such, I promise you, as might
win an astrologer from his worship of the galaxy. My sister leads the
bevy, to whom I desire to present you. She hath her admirers at Court;
and is regarded, though I might dispense with sounding her praise, as
one of the beauties of the time."

There was no refusing an engagement, where the presence of the party
invited, late so low in his own regard, was demanded by a lady of
quality, one of the choice beauties of the time. Lord Glenvarloch
accepted, as was inevitable, and spent a lively day among the gay
and the fair. He was the gallant in attendance, for the day, upon his
friend's sister, the beautiful Countess of Blackchester, who aimed at
once at superiority in the realms of fashion, of power, and of wit.

She was, indeed, considerably older than her brother, and had probably
completed her six lustres; but the deficiency in extreme youth was more
than atoned for, in the most precise and curious accuracy in attire,
an early acquaintance with every foreign mode, and a peculiar gift
in adapting the knowledge which she acquired, to her own particular
features and complexion. At Court, she knew as well as any lady in the
circle, the precise tone, moral, political, learned, or jocose, in which
it was proper to answer the monarch, according to his prevailing humour;
and was supposed to have been very active, by her personal interest,
in procuring her husband a high situation, which the gouty old viscount
could never have deserved by any merit of his own commonplace conduct
and understanding.

It was far more easy for this lady than for her brother, to reconcile
so young a courtier as Lord Glenvarloch to the customs and habits of
a sphere so new to him. In all civilised society, the females of
distinguished rank and beauty give the tone to manners, and, through
these, even to morals. Lady Blackchester had, besides, interest either
in the Court, or over the Court, (for its source could not be well
traced,) which created friends, and overawed those who might have been
disposed to play the part of enemies.

At one time, she was understood to be closely leagued with the
Buckingham family, with whom her brother still maintained a great
intimacy; and, although some coldness had taken place betwixt the
Countess and the Duchess of Buckingham, so that they were little seen
together, and the former seemed considerably to have withdrawn herself
into privacy, it was whispered that Lady Blackchester's interest with
the great favourite was not diminished in consequence of her breach with
his lady.

Our accounts of the private Court intrigues of that period, and of the
persons to whom they were intrusted, are not full enough to enable us to
pronounce upon the various reports which arose out of the circumstances
we have detailed. It is enough to say, that Lady Blackchester possessed
great influence on the circle around her, both from her beauty, her
abilities, and her reputed talents for Court intrigue; and that Nigel
Olifaunt was not long of experiencing its power, as he became a slave in
some degree to that species of habit, which carries so many men into a
certain society at a certain hour, without expecting or receiving any
particular degree of gratification, or even amusement.

His life for several weeks may be thus described. The ordinary was no
bad introduction to the business of the day; and the young lord quickly
found, that if the society there was not always irreproachable, still
it formed the most convenient and agreeable place of meeting with the
fashionable parties, with whom he visited Hyde Park, the theatres, and
other places of public resort, or joined the gay and glittering circle
which Lady Blackchester had assembled around her. Neither did he
entertain the same scrupulous horror which led him originally even to
hesitate entering into a place where gaming was permitted; but, on the
contrary, began to admit the idea, that as there could be no harm done
in beholding such recreation when only indulged in to a moderate degree,
so, from a parity of reasoning, there could be no objection to joining
in it, always under the same restrictions. But the young lord was a
Scotsman, habituated to early reflection, and totally unaccustomed to
any habit which inferred a careless risk or profuse waste of money.
Profusion was not his natural vice, or one likely to be acquired in
the course of his education; and, in all probability, while his father
anticipated with noble horror the idea of his son approaching the
gaming-table, he was more startled at the idea of his becoming a gaining
than a losing adventurer. The second, according to his principles, had
a termination, a sad one indeed, in the loss of temporal fortune--the
first quality went on increasing the evil which he dreaded, and perilled
at once both body and soul.

However the old lord might ground his apprehension, it was so far
verified by his son's conduct, that, from an observer of the various
games of chance which he witnessed, he came, by degrees, by moderate
hazards, and small bets or wagers, to take a certain interest in them.
Nor could it be denied, that his rank and expectations entitled him to
hazard a few pieces (for his game went no deeper) against persons, who,
from the readiness with which they staked their money, might be supposed
well able to afford to lose it.

It chanced, or, perhaps, according to the common belief, his evil genius
had so decreed, that Nigel's adventures were remarkably successful. He
was temperate, cautious, cool-headed, had a strong memory, and a ready
power of calculation; was besides, of a daring and intrepid character,
one upon whom no one that had looked even slightly, or spoken to
though but hastily, would readily have ventured to practise any thing
approaching to trick, or which required to be supported by intimidation.
While Lord Glenvarloch chose to play, men played with him regularly,
or, according to the phrase, upon the square; and, as he found his
luck change, or wished to hazard his good fortune no farther, the more
professed votaries of fortune, who frequented the house of Monsieur le
Chevalier de Saint Priest Beaujeu, did not venture openly to express
their displeasure at his rising a winner. But when this happened
repeatedly, the gamesters murmured amongst themselves equally at the
caution and the success of the young Scotsman; and he became far from
being a popular character among their society.

It was no slight inducement to the continuance of this most evil habit,
when it was once in some degree acquired, that it seemed to place
Lord Glenvarloch, haughty as he naturally was, beyond the necessity of
subjecting himself to farther pecuniary obligations, which his prolonged
residence in London must otherwise have rendered necessary. He had to
solicit from the ministers certain forms of office, which were to render
his sign-manual effectually useful; and these, though they could not be
denied, were delayed in such a manner, as to lead Nigel to believe there
was some secret opposition, which occasioned the demur in his business.
His own impulse was, to have appeared at Court a second time, with the
king's sign-manual in his pocket, and to have appealed to his Majesty
himself, whether the delay of the public officers ought to render his
royal generosity unavailing. But the Lord Huntinglen, that good old
peer, who had so frankly interfered in his behalf on a former occasion,
and whom he occasionally visited, greatly dissuaded him from a similar
adventure, and exhorted him quietly to await the deliverance of the
ministers, which should set him free from dancing attendance in London.

Lord Dalgarno joined his father in deterring his young friend from a
second attendance at Court, at least till he was reconciled with the
Duke of Buckingham--"a matter in which," he said, addressing his father,
"I have offered my poor assistance, without being able to prevail on
Lord Nigel to make any--not even the least--submission to the Duke of
Buckingham."

"By my faith, and I hold the laddie to be in the right on't, Malcom!"
answered the stout old Scots lord.--"What right hath Buckingham, or,
to speak plainly, the son of Sir George Villiers, to expect homage and
fealty from one more noble than himself by eight quarters? I heard him
myself, on no reason that I could perceive, term Lord Nigel his enemy;
and it will never be by my counsel that the lad speaks soft word to him,
till he recalls the hard one."

"That is precisely my advice to Lord Glenvarloch," answered Lord
Dalgarno; "but then you will admit, my dear father, that it would be the
risk of extremity for our friend to return into the presence, the duke
being his enemy--better to leave it with me to take off the heat of the
distemperature, with which some pickthanks have persuaded the duke to
regard our friend."

"If thou canst persuade Buckingham of his error, Malcolm," said his
father, "for once I will say there hath been kindness and honesty in
Court service. I have oft told your sister and yourself, that in the
general I esteem it as lightly as may be."

"You need not doubt my doing my best in Nigel's case," answered Lord
Dalgarno; "but you must think, my dear father, I must needs use slower
and gentler means than those by which you became a favourite twenty
years ago."

"By my faith, I am afraid thou wilt," answered his father.--"I tell
thee, Malcolm, I would sooner wish myself in the grave, than doubt
thine honesty or honour; yet somehow it hath chanced, that honest,
ready service, hath not the same acceptance at Court which it has in my
younger time--and yet you rise there."

"O, the time permits not your old-world service," said Lord
Dalgarno; "we have now no daily insurrections, no nightly attempts at
assassination, as were the fashion in the Scottish Court. Your prompt
and uncourteous sword-in-hand attendance on the sovereign is no
longer necessary, and would be as unbeseeming as your old-fashioned
serving-men, with their badges, broadswords, and bucklers, would be at a
court-mask. Besides, father, loyal haste hath its inconveniences. I have
heard, and from royal lips too, that when you stuck your dagger into the
traitor Ruthven, it was with such little consideration, that the point
ran a quarter of an inch into the royal buttock. The king
never talks of it but he rubs the injured part, and quotes his
_'infandum-------renovare dolorem.'_ But this comes of old fashions, and
of wearing a long Liddesdale whinger instead of a poniard of Parma. Yet
this, my dear father, you call prompt and valiant service. The king, I
am told, could not sit upright for a fortnight, though all the cushions
in Falkland were placed in his chair of state, and the Provost of
Dunfermline's borrowed to the boot of all."

"It is a lie," said the old earl, "a false lie, forge it who list!--It
is true I wore a dagger of service by my side, and not a bodkin like
yours, to pick one's teeth withal--and for prompt service--Odds nouns!
it should be prompt to be useful when kings are crying treason and
murder with the screech of a half-throttled hen. But you young courtiers
know nought of these matters, and are little better than the green geese
they bring over from the Indies, whose only merit to their masters is to
repeat their own words after them--a pack of mouthers, and flatterers,
and ear-wigs.--Well, I am old and unable to mend, else I would break all
off, and hear the Tay once more flinging himself over the Campsie Linn."

"But there is your dinner-bell, father," said Lord Dalgarno, "which, if
the venison I sent you prove seasonable, is at least as sweet a sound."

"Follow me, then, youngsters, if you list," said the old earl; and
strode on from the alcove in which this conversation was held, towards
the house, followed by the two young men.

In their private discourse, Lord Dalgarno had little trouble in
dissuading Nigel from going immediately to Court; while, on the other
hand, the offers he made him of a previous introduction to the Duke
of Buckingham, were received by Lord Glenvarloch with a positive and
contemptuous refusal. His friend shrugged his shoulders, as one who
claims the merit of having given to an obstinate friend the best
counsel, and desires to be held free of the consequences of his
pertinacity.

As for the father, his table indeed, and his best liquor, of which
he was more profuse than necessary, were at the command of his young
friend, as well as his best advice and assistance in the prosecution of
his affairs. But Lord Huntinglen's interest was more apparent than real;
and the credit he had acquired by his gallant defence of the king's
person, was so carelessly managed by himself, and so easily eluded by
the favourites and ministers of the sovereign, that, except upon one or
two occasions, when the king was in some measure taken by surprise, as
in the case of Lord Glenvarloch, the royal bounty was never efficiently
extended either to himself or to his friends.

"There never was a man," said Lord Dalgarno, whose shrewder knowledge of
the English Court saw where his father's deficiency lay, "that had it so
perfectly in his power to have made his way to the pinnacle of fortune
as my poor father. He had acquired a right to build up a staircase, step
by step, slowly and surely, letting every boon, which he begged year
after year, become in its turn the resting-place for the next annual
grant. But your fortunes shall not shipwreck upon the same coast,
Nigel," he would conclude. "If I have fewer means of influence than my
father has, or rather had, till he threw them away for butts of sack,
hawks, hounds, and such carrion, I can, far better than he, improve that
which I possess; and that, my dear Nigel, is all engaged in your behalf.
Do not be surprised or offended that you now see me less than formerly.
The stag-hunting is commenced, and the prince looks that I should attend
him more frequently. I must also maintain my attendance on the duke,
that I may have an opportunity of pleading your cause when occasion
shall permit."

"I have no cause to plead before the duke," said Nigel, gravely; "I have
said so repeatedly."

"Why, I meant the phrase no otherwise, thou churlish and suspicious
disputant," answered Dalgarno, "than as I am now pleading the duke's
cause with thee. Surely I only mean to claim a share in our royal
master's favourite benediction, _Beati Pacifici_."

Upon several occasions, Lord Glenvarloch's conversations, both with the
old earl and his son, took a similar turn and had a like conclusion. He
sometimes felt as if, betwixt the one and the other, not to mention the
more unseen and unboasted, but scarce less certain influence of Lady
Blackchester, his affair, simple as it had become, might have been
somehow accelerated. But it was equally impossible to doubt the rough
honesty of the father, and the eager and officious friendship of Lord
Dalgarno; nor was it easy to suppose that the countenance of the lady,
by whom he was received with such distinction, would be wanting, could
it be effectual in his service.

Nigel was further sensible of the truth of what Lord Dalgarno often
pointed out, that the favourite being supposed to be his enemy, every
petty officer, through whose hands his affair must necessarily pass,
would desire to make a merit of throwing obstacles in his way, which
he could only surmount by steadiness and patience, unless he preferred
closing the breach, or, as Lord Dalgarno called it, making his peace
with the Duke of Buckingham.

Nigel might, and doubtless would, have had recourse to the advice of his
friend George Heriot upon this occasion, having found it so advantageous
formerly; but the only time he saw him after their visit to Court, he
found the worthy citizen engaged in hasty preparations for a journey to
Paris, upon business of great importance in the way of his profession,
and by an especial commission from the Court and the Duke of Buckingham,
which was likely to be attended with considerable profit. The good man
smiled as he named the Duke of Buckingham. He had been, he said, pretty
sure that his disgrace in that quarter would not be of long duration.
Lord Glenvarloch expressed himself rejoiced at that reconciliation,
observing, that it had been a most painful reflection to him, that
Master Heriot should, in his behalf, have incurred the dislike, and
perhaps exposed himself to the ill offices, of so powerful a favourite.

"My lord," said Heriot, "for your father's son I would do much; and yet
truly, if I know myself, I would do as much and risk as much, for the
sake of justice, in the case of a much more insignificant person, as I
have ventured for yours. But as we shall not meet for some time, I must
commit to your own wisdom the farther prosecution of this matter."

And thus they took a kind and affectionate leave of each other.
