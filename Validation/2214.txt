shoulder by which a Frenchman implies to himself that rage would be out
of place, replied calmly, "M. de N. did as you say, but of course not
employed by me, nor with my knowledge. Listen; the truth is this,--the
time has come to tell it. Before you left Paris for Aix I found myself
on the brink of ruin. I had glided towards it with my characteristic
recklessness, with that scorn of money for itself, that sanguine
confidence in the favour of fortune, which are vices common to every roi
des viveurs. Poor mock Alexanders that we spendthrifts are in youth! we
divide all we have among others, and when asked by some prudent friend,
'What have you left for your own share?' answer, 'Hope.' I knew, of
course, that my patrimony was rapidly vanishing; but then my horses
were matchless. I had enough to last me for years on their chance of
winning--of course they would win. But you may recollect when we
parted that I was troubled,--creditors' bills before me--usurers' bills
too,--and you, my dear Louvier, pressed on me your purse, were angry
when I refused it. How could I accept? All my chance of repayment was
in the speed of a horse. I believed in that chance for myself; but for
a trustful friend, no. Ask your own heart now,--nay, I will not say
heart,--ask your own common-sense, whether a man who then put aside your
purse--spendthrift, vaurien, though he might be--was likely to steal or
accept a woman's jewels. Va, mon pauvre Louvier, again I say, 'Fors non
mutat genus.'"

Despite the repetition of the displeasing patrician motto, such
reminiscences of his visitor's motley character--irregular, turbulent,
the reverse of severe, but, in its own loose way, grandly generous and
grandly brave--struck both on the common-sense and the heart of the
listener; and the Frenchman recognized the Frenchman. Louvier doubted De
Mauleon's word no more, bowed his head, and said, "Victor de Mauleon, I
have wronged you; go on."

"On the day after you left for Aix came that horse-race on which my
all depended: it was lost. The loss absorbed the whole of my remaining
fortune; it absorbed about twenty thousand francs in excess, a debt of
honour to De N., whom you called my friend. Friend he was not; imitator,
follower, flatterer, yes. Still I deemed him enough my friend to say to
him, 'Give me a little time to pay the money; I must sell my stud, or
write to my only living relation from whom I have expectations.' You
remember that relation,--Jacques de Mauleon, old and unmarried. By De
N.'s advice I did write to my kinsman. No answer came; but what did come
were fresh bills from creditors. I then calmly calculated my assets. The
sale of my stud and effects might suffice to pay every sou that I owed,
including my debt to De N.; but that was not quite certain. At all
events, when the debts were paid I should be beggared. Well, you know,
Louvier, what we Frenchmen are: how Nature has denied to us the quality
of patience; how involuntarily suicide presents itself to us when hope
is lost; and suicide seemed to me here due to honour, namely, to the
certain discharge of my liabilities,--for the stud and effects of Victor
de Mauleon, roi des viveurs, would command much higher prices if he died
like Cato than if he ran away from his fate like Pompey. Doubtless De N.
guessed my intention from my words or my manner; but on the very day
in which I had made all preparations for quitting the world from
which sunshine had vanished, I received in a blank envelope bank-notes
amounting to seventy thousand francs, and the post-mark on the envelope
was that of the town of Fontainebleau, near to which lived my rich
kinsman Jacques. I took it for granted that the sum came from him.
Displeased as he might have been with my wild career, still I was
his natural heir. The sum sufficed to pay my debt to De N., to all
creditors, and leave a surplus. My sanguine spirits returned. I would
sell my stud; I would retrench, reform, go to my kinsman as the penitent
son. The fatted calf would be killed, and I should wear purple yet. You
understand that, Louvier?"

"Yes, yes; so like you. Go on."

"Now, then, came the thunderbolt! Ah! in those sunny days you used
to envy me for being so spoilt by women. The Duchesse de ------ had
conceived for me one of those romantic fancies which women without
children and with ample leisure for the waste of affection do sometimes
conceive for very ordinary men younger than themselves, but in whom they
imagine they discover sinners to reform or heroes to exalt. I had been
honoured by some notes from the Duchesse in which this sort of romance
was owned. I had not replied to them encouragingly. In truth, my heart
was then devoted to another,--the English girl whom I had wooed as my
wife; who, despite her parents' retraction of their consent to our union
when they learned how dilapidated were my fortunes, pledged herself
to remain faithful to me, and wait for better days." Again De Mauleon
paused in suppressed emotion, and then went on hurriedly: "No, the
Duchesse did not inspire me with guilty passion, but she did inspire me
with an affectionate respect. I felt that she was by nature meant to be
a great and noble creature, and was, nevertheless, at that moment
wholly misled from her right place amongst women by an illusion of mere
imagination about a man who happened then to be very much talked about,
and perhaps resembled some Lothario in the novels which she was always
reading. We lodged, as you may remember, in the same house."

"Yes, I remember. I remember how you once took me to a great ball given
by the Duchesse; how handsome I thought her, though no longer young; and
you say right--how I did envy you, that night!"

"From that night, however, the Duc, not unnaturally, became jealous. He
reproved the Duchesse for her too amiable manner towards a mauvais sujet
like myself, and forbade her in future to receive my visits. It was then
that these notes became frequent and clandestine, brought to me by her
maid, who took back my somewhat chilling replies.

"But to proceed. In the flush of my high spirits, and in the insolence
of magnificent ease with which I paid De N------ the trifle I owed him,
something he said made my heart stand still."

"I told him that the money received had come from Jacques de Mauleon,
and that I was going down to his house that day to thank him. He
replied, 'Don't go; it did not come from him.' 'It must; see
the post-mark of the envelope,--Fontainebleau.' 'I posted it at
Fontainebleau.' 'You sent me the money, you!' 'Nay, that is beyond my
means. Where it came from,' said this miserable, 'much more may yet
come;' and then be narrated, with that cynicism so in vogue at Paris,
how he had told the Duchesse (who knew him as my intimate associate)
of my stress of circumstance, of his fear that I meditated something
desperate; how she gave him the jewels to sell and to substitute; how,
in order to baffle my suspicion and frustrate my scruples, he had
gone to Fontainebleau and there posted the envelope containing the
bank-notes, out of which he secured for himself the payment he deemed
otherwise imperilled. De N. having made this confession, hurried down
the stairs swiftly enough to save himself a descent by the window. Do
you believe me still?"

"Yes; you were always so hot-blooded, and De N. so considerate of self,
I believe you implicitly."

"Of course I did what any man would do; I wrote a hasty letter to the
Duchesse, stating all my gratitude for an act of pure friendship so
noble; urging also the reasons that rendered it impossible for a man of
honour to profit by such an act. Unhappily, what had been sent was paid
away ere I knew the facts; but I could not bear the thought of life till
my debt to her was acquitted; in short, Louvier, conceive for yourself
the sort of letter which I--which any honest man--would write, under
circumstances so cruel."

"H'm!" grunted Louvier.

"Something, however, in my letter, conjoined with what De N. had told
her as to my state of mind, alarmed this poor woman, who had deigned to
take in me an interest so little deserved. Her reply, very agitated and
incoherent, was brought to me by her maid, who had taken my letter, and
by whom, as I before said, our correspondence had been of late carried
on. In her reply she implored me to decide, to reflect on nothing till I
had seen her; stated how the rest of her day was pre-engaged; and since
to visit her openly had been made impossible by the Due's interdict,
enclosed the key to the private entrance to her rooms, by which I could
gain an interview with her at ten o'clock that night, an hour at which
the Duc had informed her he should be out till late at his club. Now,
however great the indiscretion which the Duchesse here committed, it is
due to her memory to say that I am convinced that her dominant idea was
that I meditated self-destruction; that no time was to be lost to
save me from it; and for the rest she trusted to the influence which
a woman's tears and adjurations and reasonings have over even the
strongest and hardest men. It is only one of those coxcombs in whom the
world of fashion abounds who could have admitted a thought that would
have done wrong to the impulsive, generous, imprudent eagerness of a
woman to be in time to save from death by his own hand a fellow-being
for whom she had conceived an interest. I so construed her note. At the
hour she named I admitted myself into the rooms by the key she sent. You
know the rest: I was discovered by the Duc and by the agents of police
in the cabinet in which the Duchesse's jewels were kept. The key that
admitted me into the cabinet was found in my possession."

De Mauleon's voice here faltered, and he covered his face with a
convulsive hand. Almost in the same breath he recovered from visible
sign of emotion, and went on with a half laugh.

"Ah! you envied me, did you, for being spoiled by the women? Enviable
position indeed was mine that night! The Duc obeyed the first impulse of
his wrath. He imagined that I had dishonoured him; he would dishonour
me in return. Easier to his pride, too, a charge against the robber of
jewels than against a favoured lover of his wife. But when I, obeying
the first necessary obligation of honour, invented on the spur of the
moment the story by which the Duchesse's reputation was cleared from
suspicion, accused myself of a frantic passion and the trickery of
a fabricated key, the Due's true nature of gentilhomme came back. He
retracted the charge which he could scarcely even at the first blush
have felt to be well-founded; and as the sole charge left was simply
that which men comme il faut do not refer to criminal courts and police
investigations, I was left to make my bow unmolested and retreat to my
own rooms, awaiting there such communciations as the Duc might deem it
right to convey to me on the morrow.

"But on the morrow the Duc, with his wife and personal suite, quitted
Paris en route for Spain; the bulk of his retinue, including the
offending Abigail, was discharged; and, whether through these servants
or through the police, the story before evening was in the mouth of
every gossip in club or cafe,--exaggerated, distorted, to my ignominy
and shame. My detection in the cabinet, the sale of the jewels, the
substitution of paste by De N., who was known to be my servile imitator
and reputed to be my abject tool, all my losses on the turf, my
debts,--all these scattered fibres of flax were twisted together in a
rope that would have hanged a dog with a much better name than mine. If
some disbelieved that I could be a thief, few of those who should have
known me best held me guiltless of a baseness almost equal to that of
theft,--the exaction of profit from the love of a foolish woman."

"But you could have told your own tale, shown the letters you had
received from the Duchesse, and cleared away every stain on your
honour."

"How?--shown her letters, ruined her character, even stated that she
had caused her jewels to be sold for the uses of a young roue! Ah, no,
Louvier! I would rather have gone to the galleys."

"H'm!" grunted Louvier again.

"The Duc generously gave me better means of righting myself. Three
days after he quitted Paris I received a letter from him, very politely
written, expressing his great regret that any words implying the
suspicion too monstrous and absurd to need refutation should have
escaped him in the surprise of the moment; but stating that since the
offence I had owned was one that he could not overlook, he was under
the necessity of asking the only reparation I could make. That if it
'deranged' me to quit Paris, he would return to it for the purpose
required; but that if I would give him the additional satisfaction
of suiting his convenience, he should prefer to await my arrival at
Bayonne, where he was detained by the indisposition of the Duchesse."

"You have still that letter?" asked Louvier, quickly. "Yes; with
other more important documents constituting what I may call my pieces
justificatives.

"I need not say that I replied stating the time at which I should arrive
at Bayonne, and the hotel at which I should await the Duc's command.
Accordingly I set out that same day, gained the hotel named, despatched
to the Duc the announcement of my arrival, and was considering how I
should obtain a second in some officer quartered in the town--for
my soreness and resentment at the marked coldness of my former
acquaintances at Paris had forbidden me to seek a second among any of
that faithless number--when the Due himself entered my room. Judge of my
amaze at seeing him in person; judge how much greater the amaze became
when he advanced with a grave but cordial smile, offering me his hand!

"'Monsieur de Mauleon,' said he, 'since I wrote to you, facts have
become known to me which would induce me rather to ask your friendship
than call on you to defend your life. Madame la Duchesse has been
seriously ill since we left Paris, and I refrained from all explanations
likely to add to the hysterical excitement under which she was
suffering. It is only this day that her mind became collected, and she
herself then gave me her entire confidence. Monsieur, she insisted on my
reading the letters that you addressed to her. Those letters, Monsieur,
suffice to prove your innocence of any design against my peace. The
Duchesse has so candidly avowed her own indiscretion, has so clearly
established the distinction between indiscretion and guilt, that I have
granted her my pardon with a lightened heart and a firm belief that we
shall be happier together than we have been yet.'

"The Due continued his journey the next day, but he subsequently
honoured me with two or three letters written as friend to friend, and
in which you will find repeated the substance of what I have stated him
to say by word of mouth."

"But why not then have returned to Paris? Such letters, at least, you
might have shown, and in braving your calumniators you would have soon
lived them down."

"You forget that I was a ruined man. When, by the sale of my horses,
etc., my debts, including what was owed to the Duchesse, and which I
remitted to the Duc, were discharged, the balance left to me would
not have maintained me a week at Paris. Besides, I felt so sore, so
indignant. Paris and the Parisians had become to me so hateful. And to
crown all, that girl, that English girl whom I had so loved, on whose
fidelity I had so counted--well, I received a letter from her, gently
but coldly bidding me farewell forever. I do not think she believed me
guilty of theft; but doubtless the offence I had confessed, in order to
save the honour of the Duchesse, could but seem to her all sufficient!
Broken in spirit, bleeding at heart to the very core, still
self-destruction was no longer to be thought of. I would not die till I
could once more lift up my head as Victor de Mauleon."

"What then became of you, my poor Victor?"

"Ah! that is a tale too long for recital. I have played so many parts
that I am puzzled to recognize my own identity with the Victor de
Mauleon whose name I abandoned. I have been a soldier in Algeria, and
won my cross on the field of battle,--that cross and my colonel's
letter are among my pieces justificatives; I have been a gold-digger in
California, a speculator in New York, of late in callings obscure and
humble. But in all my adventures, under whatever name, I have earned
testimonials of probity, could manifestations of so vulgar a virtue
be held of account by the enlightened people of Paris. I come now to a
close. The Vicomte de Mauleon is about to re-appear in Paris, and the
first to whom he announces that sublime avatar is Paul Louvier. When
settled in some modest apartment, I shall place in your hands my pieces
justificatives. I shall ask you to summon my surviving relations or
connections, among which are the Counts de Vandemar, Beauvilliers, De
Passy, and the Marquis de Rochebriant, with any friends of your own who
sway the opinions of the Great World. You will place my justification
before them, expressing your own opinion that it suffices; in a word,
you will give me the sanction of your countenance. For the rest, I trust
to myself to propitiate the kindly and to silence the calumnious. I have
spoken; what say you?"

"You overrate my power in society. Why not appeal yourself to your
high-born relations?"

"No, Louvier; I have too well considered the case to alter my decision.
It is through you, and you alone, that I shall approach my relations.
My vindicator must be a man of whom the vulgar cannot say, 'Oh, he is a
relation,--a fellow-noble; those aristocrats whitewash each other.'
It must be an authority with the public at large,--a bourgeois, a
millionaire, a roi de la Bourse. I choose you, and that ends the
discussion."

Louvier could not help laughing good-humouredly at the sang froid of the
Vicomte. He was once more under the domination of a man who had for a
time dominated all with whom he lived.

De Mauleon continued: "Your task will be easy enough. Society changes
rapidly at Paris. Few persons now exist who have more than a vague
recollection of the circumstances which can be so easily explained to my
complete vindication when the vindication comes from a man of your solid
respectability and social influence. Besides, I have political
objects in view. You are a Liberal; the Vandemars and Rochebriants are
Legitimists. I prefer a godfather on the Liberal side. Pardieu, mon ami,
why such coquettish hesitation? Said and done. Your hand on it."

"There is my hand then. I will do all I can to help you."

"I know you will, old friend; and you do both kindly and wisely." Here
De Mauleon cordially pressed the hand he held, and departed.

On gaining the street, the Vicomte glided into a neighbouring courtyard,
in which he had left his fiacre, and bade the coachman drive towards the
Boulevard Sebastopol. On the way, he took from a small bag that he
had left in the carriage the flaxen wig and pale whiskers which
distinguished M. Lebeau, and mantled his elegant habiliments in an
immense cloak, which he had also left in the fiacre. Arrived at the
Boulevard Sebastopol, he drew up the collar of the cloak so as to
conceal much of his face, stopped the driver, paid him quickly, and, bag
in hand, hurried on to another stand of fiacres at a little distance,
entered one, drove to the Faubourg Montmartre, dismissed the vehicle
at the mouth of a street not far from M. Lebeau's office, and gained
on foot the private side-door of the house, let himself in with his
latchkey, entered the private room on the inner side of his office,
locked the door, and proceeded leisurely to exchange the brilliant
appearance which the Vicomte de Mauleon had borne on his visit to the
millionaire for the sober raiment and bourgeois air of M. Lebeau, the
letter-writer.

Then after locking up his former costume in a drawer of his secretaire,
he sat himself down and wrote the following lines:--

   DEAR MONSIEUR GEORGES,--I advise you strongly, from information that
   has just reached me, to lose no time in pressing M. Savarin to repay
   the sum I recommended you to lend him, and for which you hold his
   bill due this day. The scandal of legal measures against a writer
   so distinguished should be avoided if possible. He will avoid it
   and get the money somehow; but he must be urgently pressed. If you
   neglect this warning, my responsibility is past. Agreez mes
   sentimens les plus sinceres.
                       J. L.




CHAPTER II.

The Marquis de Rochebriant is no longer domiciled in an attic in the
gloomy Faubourg. See him now in a charming appartement de garcon an
premier in the Rue du Helder, close by the promenades and haunts of
the mode. It had been furnished and inhabited by a brilliant young
provincial from Bordeaux, who, coming into an inheritance of one hundred
thousand francs, had rushed up to Paris to enjoy himself, and make his
million at the Bourse. He had enjoyed himself thoroughly,--he had been
a darling of the demi monde; he had been a successful and an inconstant
gallant. Zelie had listened to his vows of eternal love, and his offers
of unlimited cachemires; Desiree, succeeding Zelie, had assigned to him
her whole heart--or all that was left of it--in gratitude for the
ardour of his passion, and the diamonds and coupe which accompanied and
attested the ardour; the superb Hortense, supplanting Desiree,
received his visits in the charming apartment he furnished for her, and
entertained him and his friends at the most delicate little suppers, for
the moderate sum of four thousand francs a month. Yes, he had enjoyed
himself thoroughly, but he had not made a million at the Bourse. Before
the year was out, the one hundred thousand francs were gone. Compelled
to return to his province, and by his hard-hearted relations ordained,
on penalty of starvation, to marry the daughter of an avoue, for
the sake of her dot and a share in the hated drudgery of the avoue's
business,--his apartment was to be had for a tenth part of the original
cost of its furniture. A certain Chevalier de Finisterre, to whom
Louvier had introduced the Marquis as a useful fellow who knew Paris,
and would save him from being cheated, had secured this bijou of an
apartment for Alain, and concluded the bargain for the bagatelle of
L500. The Chevalier took the same advantageous occasion to purchase the
English well-bred hack and the neat coupe and horses which the Bordelais
was also necessitated to dispose of. These purchases made, the Marquis
had some five thousand francs (L200) left out of Louvier's premium of
L1,000. The Marquis, however, did not seem alarmed or dejected by the
sudden diminution of capital so expeditiously effected. The easy life
thus commenced seemed to him too natural to be fraught with danger;
and easy though it was, it was a very simple and modest sort of life
compared with that of many other men of his age to whom Enguerrand had
introduced him, though most of them had an income less than his, and
few, indeed, of them were his equals in dignity of birth. Could a
Marquis de Rochebriant, if he lived at Paris at all, give less than
three thousand francs a year for his apartment, or mount a more humble
establishment than that confined to a valet and a tiger, two horses for
his coupe and one for the saddle? "Impossible," said the Chevalier de
Finisterre, decidedly; and the Marquis bowed to so high an authority. He
thought within himself, "If I find in a few months that I am exceeding
my means, I can but dispose of my rooms and my horses, and return to
Rochebriant a richer man by far than I left it."

To say truth, the brilliant seductions of Paris had already produced
their effect, not only on the habits, but on the character and cast of
thought, which the young noble had brought with him from the feudal and
melancholy Bretagne.

Warmed by the kindness with which, once introduced by his popular
kinsmen, he was everywhere received, the reserve or shyness which is the
compromise between the haughtiness of self-esteem and the painful doubt
of appreciation by others rapidly melted away. He caught insensibly the
polished tone, at once so light and so cordial, of his new-made
friends. With all the efforts of the democrats to establish equality and
fraternity, it is among the aristocrats that equality and fraternity are
most to be found. All gentilshommes in the best society are equals;
and whether they embrace or fight each other, they embrace or fight
as brothers of the same family. But with the tone of manners Alain de
Rochebriant imbibed still more insensibly the lore of that philosophy
which young idlers in pursuit of pleasure teach to each other. Probably
in all civilized and luxurious capitals that philosophy is very much
the same among the same class of idlers at the same age; probably it
flourishes in Pekin not less than at Paris. If Paris has the credit,
or discredit, of it more than any other capital, it is because in Paris
more than in any other capital it charms the eye by grace and amuses
the ear by wit. A philosophy which takes the things of this life very
easily; which has a smile and a shrug of the shoulders for any
pretender to the Heroic; which subdivides the wealth of passion into the
pocket-money of caprices, is always in or out of love ankle-deep, never
venturing a plunge; which, light of heart as of tongue, turns "the
solemn plausibilities" of earth into subjects for epigrams and bons
mots,--jests at loyalty to kings and turns up its nose at enthusiasm
for commonwealths, abjures all grave studies and shuns all profound
emotions. We have crowds of such philosophers in London; but there they
are less noticed, because the agreeable attributes of the sect are there
dimmed and obfuscated. It is not a philosophy that flowers richly in
the reek of fogs and in the teeth of east winds; it wants for full
development the light atmosphere of Paris. Now this philosophy began
rapidly to exercise its charms upon Alain de Rochebriant. Even in the
society of professed Legitimists, he felt that faith had deserted the
Legitimist creed or taken refuge only as a companion of religion in
the hearts of high-born women and a small minority of priests. His
chivalrous loyalty still struggled to keep its ground, but its
roots were very much loosened. He saw--for his natural intellect was
keen--that the cause of the Bourbon was hopeless, at least for the
present, because it had ceased, at least for the present, to be a cause.
His political creed thus shaken, with it was shaken also that adherence
to the past which had stifled his ambition of a future. That ambition
began to breathe and to stir, though he owned it not to others, though,
as yet, he scarce distinguished its whispers, much less directed its
movements towards any definite object. Meanwhile, all that he knew of
his ambition was the new-born desire for social success.

We see him, then, under the quick operation of this change in sentiments
and habits, reclined on the fauteuil before his fireside, and listening
to his college friend, of whom we have so long lost sight, Frederic
Lemercier. Frederic had breakfasted with Alain,--a breakfast such as
might have contented the author of the "Almanach des Gourmands," and
provided from the cafe Anglais. Frederic has just thrown aside his
regalia.

"Pardieu! my dear Alain. If Louvier has no sinister object in the
generosity of his dealings with you, he will have raised himself
prodigiously in my estimation. I shall forsake, in his favour, my
allegiance to Duplessis, though that clever fellow has just made a
wondrous coup in the Egyptians, and I gain forty thousand francs by
having followed his advice. But if Duplessis has a head as long as
Louvier's, he certainly has not an equal greatness of soul. Still, my
dear friend, will you pardon me if I speak frankly, and in the way of a
warning homily?"

"Speak; you cannot oblige me more."

"Well, then, I know that you can no more live at Paris in the way you
are doing, or mean to do, without some fresh addition to your income,
than a lion could live in the Jardin des Plantes upon an allowance of
two mice a week."

"I don't see that. Deducting what I pay to my aunt,--and I cannot get
her to take more than six thousand francs a year,--I have seven hundred
napoleons left, net and clear. My rooms and stables are equipped, and
I have twenty-five hundred francs in hand. On seven hundred napoleons
a year, I calculate that I can very easily live as I do; and if I
fail--well, I must return to Pochebriant. Seven hundred napoleons a year
will be a magnificent rental there."

Frederic shook his head. "You do not know how one expense leads to
another. Above all, you do not calculate the chief part of one's
expenditure,--the unforeseen. You will play at the Jockey Club, and lose
half your income in a night."

"I shall never touch a card."

"So you say now, innocent as a lamb of the force of example. At all
events, beau seigneur, I presume you are not going to resuscitate the
part of the Ermite de la Chaussee d'Antin; and the fair Parisiennes are
demons of extravagance."

"Demons whom I shall not court."

"Did I say you would? They will court you. Before another month has
flown you will be inundated with billets-doux."

"It is not a shower that will devastate my humble harvest. But, mon
cher, we are falling upon very gloomy topics. Laissez-moi tranquille in
my illusions, if illusions they be. Ah, you cannot conceive what a new
life opens to the man who, like myself, has passed the dawn of his youth
in privation and fear, when he suddenly acquires competence and hope. If
it lasts only a year, it will be something to say 'Vixi.'"

"Alain," said Frederic; very earnestly, "believe me, I should not have
assumed the ungracious and inappropriate task of Mentor, if it were only
a year's experience at stake, or if you were in the position of men like
myself,--free from the encumbrance of a great name and heavily mortgaged
lands. Should you fail to pay regularly the interest due to Louvier,
he has the power to put up at public auction, and there to buy in for
himself, your chateau and domain."

"I am aware that in strict law he would have such power, though I doubt
if he would use it. Louvier is certainly a much better and more generous
fellow than I could have expected; and if I believe De Finisterre, he
has taken a sincere liking to me on account of affection to my poor
father. But why should not the interest be paid regularly? The revenues
from Rochebriant are not likely to decrease, and the charge on them is
lightened by the contract with Louvier. And I will confide to you a hope
I entertain of a very large addition to my rental."

"How?"

"A chief part of my rental is derived from forests, and De Finisterre
has heard of a capitalist who is disposed to make a contract for their
sale at the fall this year, and may probably extend it to future years,
at a price far exceeding that which I have hitherto obtained."

"Pray be cautious. De Finisterre is not a man I should implicitly trust
in such matters."

"Why? Do you know anything against him? He is in the best
society,--perfect gentilhomme,--and, as his name may tell you, a
fellow-Breton. You yourself allow, and so does Enguerrand, that the
purchases he made for me--in this apartment, my horses, etc.--are
singularly advantageous."

"Quite true; the Chevalier is reputed sharp and clever, is said to
be very amusing, and a first-rate piquet-player. I don't know him
personally,--I am not in his set. I have no valid reason to disparage
his character, nor do I conjecture any motive he could have to injure or
mislead you. Still, I say, be cautious how far you trust to his advice
or recommendation."

"Again I ask why?"

"He is unlucky to his friends. He attaches himself much to men younger
than himself; and somehow or other I have observed that most of them
have come to grief. Besides, a person in whose sagacity I have great
confidence warned me against making the Chevalier's acquaintance, and
said to me, in his blunt way, 'De Finisterre came to Paris with nothing;
he has succeeded to nothing; he belongs to no ostensible profession by
which anything can be made. But evidently now he has picked up a good
deal; and in proportion as any young associate of his becomes poorer,
De Finisterre seems mysteriously to become richer. Shun that sort of
acquaintance.'"

"Who is your sagacious adviser!"

"Duplessis."

"Ah, I thought so. That bird of prey fancies every other bird
looking out for pigeons. I fancy that Duplessis is, like all those
money-getters, a seeker after fashion, and De Finisterre has not
returned his bow."

"My dear Alain, I am to blame; nothing is so irritating as a dispute
about the worth of the men we like. I began it, now let it be dropped;
only make me one promise,--that if you should be in arrear, or if need
presses, you will come at once to me. It was very well to be absurdly
proud in an attic, but that pride will be out of place in your
appartement au premier."

"You are the best fellow in the world, Frederic, and I make you the
promise you ask," said Alain, cheerfully, but yet with a secret emotion
of tenderness and gratitude. "And now, mon cher, what day will you dine
with me to meet Raoul and Enguerrand, and some others whom you would
like to know?"

"Thanks, and hearty ones, but we move now in different spheres, and
I shall not trespass on yours. Je suis trop bourgeois to incur the
ridicule of le bourgeois gentilhomme."

"Frederic, how dare you speak thus? My dear fellow, my friends shall
honour you as I do."

"But that will be on your account, not mine. No; honestly that kind of
society neither tempts nor suits me. I am a sort of king in my own walk;
and I prefer my Bohemian royalty to vassalage in higher regions. Say no
more of it. It will flatter my vanity enough if you will now and then
descend to my coteries, and allow me to parade a Rochebriant as my
familiar crony, slap him on the shoulder, and call him Alain."

"Fie! you who stopped me and the English aristocrat in the Champs
Elysees, to humble us with your boast of having fascinated une grande
dame,--I think you said a duchesse."

"Oh," said Lemercier, conceitedly, and passing his hand through his
scented locks, "women are different; love levels all ranks. I don't
blame Ruy Blas for accepting the love of a queen, but I do blame him
for passing himself off as a noble,--a plagiarism, by the by, from an
English play. I do not love the English enough to copy them. A propos,
what has become of ce beau Grarm Varn? I have not seen him of late."

"Neither have I."

"Nor the belle Italienne?"

"Nor her," said Alain, slightly blushing.

At this moment Enguerrand lounged into the room. Alain stopped Lemercier
to introduce him to his kinsman. "Enguerrand, I present to you M.
Lemercier, my earliest and one of my dearest friends."

The young noble held out his hand with the bright and joyous grace
which accompanied all his movements, and expressed in cordial words
his delight to make M. Lemercier's acquaintance. Bold and assured as
Frederic was in his own circles, he was more discomposed than set at
ease by the gracious accost of a lion, whom he felt at once to be of a
breed superior to his own. He muttered some confused phrases, in which
ravi and flatte were alone audible, and evanished.

"I know M. Lemercier by sight very well," said Enguerrand, seating
himself. "One sees him very often in the Bois; and I have met him in
the Coulisses and the Bal Mabille. I think, too, that he plays at the
Bourse, and is lie with M. Duplessis, who bids fair to rival Louvier one
of these days. Is Duplessis also one of your dearest friends?"

"No, indeed. I once met him, and was not prepossessed in his favour."

"Nevertheless, he is a man much to be admired and respected."

"Why so?"

"Because he understands so well the art of making what we all
covet,--money. I will introduce you to him."

"I have been already introduced."

"Then I will re-introduce you. He is much courted in a society which I
have recently been permitted by my father to frequent,--the society, of
the Imperial Court."

"You frequent that society, and the Count permits it?"

"Yes; better the Imperialists than the Republicans; and my father begins
to own that truth, though he is too old or too indolent to act on it."

"And Raoul?"

"Oh, Raoul, the melancholy and philosophical Raoul, has no ambition
of any kind, so long as--thanks somewhat to me--his purse is always
replenished for the wants of his stately existence, among the foremost
of which wants are the means to supply the wants of others. That is the
true reason why he consents to our glove-shop. Raoul belongs, with some
other young men of the Faubourg, to a society enrolled under the name
of Saint Francois de Sales, for the relief of the poor. He visits their
houses, and is at home by their sickbeds as at their stinted boards.
Nor does he confine his visitations to the limits of our Faubourg; he
extends his travels to Montmartre and Belleville. As to our upper world,
he does not concern himself much with its changes. He says that we have
destroyed too much ever to rebuild solidly; and that whatever we do
build could be upset any day by a Paris mob, which he declares to be
the only institution we have left. A wonderful fellow is Raoul,--full of
mind, though he does little with it; full of heart, which he devotes
to suffering humanity, and to a poetic, knightly reverence (not to be
confounded with earthly love, and not to be degraded into that sickly
sentiment called Platonic affection) for the Comtesse di Rimini, who is
six years older than himself, and who is very faithfully attached to
her husband, Raoul's intimate friend, whose honour he would guard as
his own. It is an episode in the drama of Parisian life, and one not so
uncommon as the malignant may suppose. Di Rimini knows and approves of
his veneration; my mother, the best of women, sanctions it, and deems
truly that it preserves Raoul safe from all the temptations to which
ignobler youth is exposed. I mention this lest you should imagine there
was anything in Raoul's worship of his star less pure than it is.
For the rest, Raoul, to the grief and amazement of that disciple of
Voltaire, my respected father, is one of the very few men I know in our
circles who is sincerely religious,--an orthodox Catholic,--and the only
man I know who practises the religion he professes; charitable, chaste,
benevolent; and no bigot, no intolerant ascetic. His only weakness
is his entire submission to the worldly common-sense of his
good-for-nothing, covetous, ambitious brother Enguerrand. I cannot say
how I love him for that. If he had not such a weakness, his excellence
would gall me, and I believe I should hate him."

Alain bowed his head at this eulogium. Such had been the character that
a few months ago he would have sought as example and model. He seemed to
gaze upon a flattered portrait of himself as he had been.

"But," said Enguerrand, "I have not come here to indulge in the overflow
of brotherly affection. I come to take you to your relation, the
Duchesse of Tarascon. I have pledged myself to her to bring you, and she
is at home on purpose to receive you."

"In that case I cannot be such a churl as to refuse. And, indeed, I no
longer feel quite the same prejudices against her and the Imperialists
as I brought from Bretagne. Shall I order my carriage?"

"No; mine is at the door. Yours can meet you where you will, later.
Allons."




CHAPTER III.

The Duchesse de Tarascon occupied a vast apartment in the Rue Royale,
close to the Tuileries. She held a high post among the ladies who graced
the brilliant court of the Empress. She had survived her second husband
the duke, who left no issue, and the title died with him.

Alain and Enguerrand were ushered up the grand staircase, lined with
tiers of costly exotics as if for a fete; but in that and in all kinds
of female luxury, the Duchesse lived in a state of fete perpetuelle.
The doors on the landing-place were screened by heavy portieres of Genoa
velvet, richly embroidered in gold with the ducal crown and cipher. The
two salons through which the visitors passed to the private cabinet or
boudoir were decorated with Gobelin tapestries, fresh, with a mixture
of roseate hues, and depicting incidents in the career of the first
emperor; while the effigies of the late duke's father--the gallant
founder of a short-lived race figured modestly in the background. On a
table of Russian malachite within the recess of the central window lay,
preserved in glass cases, the baton and the sword, the epaulettes
and the decorations of the brave Marshal. On the consoles and the
mantelpieces stood clocks and vases of Sevres that could scarcely be
eclipsed by those in the Imperial palaces. Entering the cabinet, they
found the Duchesse seated at her writing-table, with a small Skye
terrier, hideous in the beauty of the purest breed, nestled at her
feet. This room was an exquisite combination of costliness and
comfort,--Luxury at home. The hangings were of geranium-coloured
silk, with double curtains of white satin; near to the writing-table a
conservatory, with a white marble fountain at play in the centre, and
a trellised aviary at the back. The walls were covered with small
pictures,--chiefly portraits and miniatures of the members of the
imperial family, of the late Duc, of his father the Marshal and Madame
la Marechale, of the present Duchesse herself, and of some of the
principal ladies of the court.

The Duchesse was still in the prime of life. She had passed her fortieth
year, but was so well "conserved" that you might have guessed her to
be ten years younger. She was tall; not large, but with rounded figure
inclined to en bon point; with dark hair and eyes, but fair complexion,
injured in effect rather than improved by pearl-powder, and that
atrocious barbarism of a dark stain on the eyelids which has of late
years been a baneful fashion; dressed,--I am a man, and cannot describe
her dress; all I know is that she had the acknowledged fame of the
best-dressed subject of France. As she rose from her seat there was in
her look and air the unmistakable evidence of grande dame,--a family
likeness in feature to Alain himself, a stronger likeness to the picture
of her first cousin (his mother) which was preserved at Rochebriant. Her
descent was indeed from ancient and noble houses. But to the distinction
of race she added that of fashion, crowning both with a tranquil
consciousness of lofty position and unblemished reputation.

"Unnatural cousin!" she said to Alain, offering her hand to him, with
a gracious smile,--"all this age in Paris, and I see you for the first
time. But there is joy on earth as in heaven over sinners who truly
repent. You repent truly--n'est ce pas?"

It is impossible to describe the caressing charm which the Duchesse
threw into her words, voice, and look. Alain was fascinated and subdued.

"Ah, Madame la Duchesse," said he, bowing over the fait hand he lightly
held, "it was not sin, unless modesty be a sin, which made a rustic
hesitate long before he dared to offer his homage to the queen of the
graces."

"Not badly said for a rustic," cried Enguerrand; "eh, Madame?"

"My cousin, you are pardoned," said the Duchesse. "Compliment is the
perfume of gentilhommerie; and if you brought enough of that perfume
from the flowers of Rochebriant to distribute among the ladies at
court, you will be terribly the mode there. Seducer!"--here she gave
the Marquis a playful tap on the cheek, not in a coquettish but in a
mother-like familiarity, and looking at him attentively, said: "Why,
you are even handsomer than your father. I shall be proud to present to
their Imperial Majesties so becoming a cousin. But seat yourselves here,
Messieurs, close to my arm-chair, caussons."

The Duchesse then took up the ball of the conversation. She talked
without any apparent artifice, but with admirable tact; put just the
questions about Rochebriant most calculated to please Alain, shunning
all that might have pained him; asking him for descriptions of the
surrounding scenery, the Breton legends; hoping that the old castle
would never be spoiled by modernizing restorations; inquiring tenderly
after his aunt, whom she had in her childhood once seen, and still
remembered with her sweet, grave face; paused little for replies; then
turned to Enguerrand with sprightly small-talk on the topics of the day,
and every now and then bringing Alain into the pale of the talk, leading
on insensibly until she got Enguerrand himself to introduce the subject
of the emperor, and the political troubles which were darkening a reign
heretofore so prosperous and splendid.

Her countenance then changed; it became serious, and even grave in its
expression.

"It is true," she said, "that the times grow menacing, menacing not only
to the throne, but to order and property and France. One by one they are
removing all the breakwaters which the empire had constructed between
the executive and the most fickle and impulsive population that ever
shouted 'long live' one day to the man whom they would send to the
guillotine the next. They are denouncing what they call personal
government. Grant that it has its evils; but what would they
substitute,--a constitutional monarchy like the English? That is
impossible with universal suffrage and without an hereditary chamber.
The nearest approach to it was the monarchy of Louis Philippe,--we
know how sick they became of that. A republic?--mon Dieu! composed of
Republicans terrified out of their wits at each other. The moderate
men, mimics of the Girondins, with the Reds and the Socialists and the
Communists, ready to tear them to pieces. And then--What then?--the
commercialists, the agriculturists, the middle class combining to elect
some dictator who will cannonade the mob and become a mimic Napoleon,
grafted on a mimic Necker or a mimic Danton. Oh, Messieurs, I am French
to the core. You inheritors of such names must be as French as I am; and
yet you men insist on remaining more useless to France in the midst of
her need than I am,--I, a woman who can but talk and weep."

The Duchesse spoke with a warmth of emotion which startled and
profoundly affected Alain. He remained silent, leaving it to Enguerrand
to answer.

"Dear Madame," said the latter, "I do not see how either myself or our
kinsman can merit your reproach. We are not legislators. I doubt if
there is a single department in France that would elect us, if we
offered ourselves. It is not our fault if the various floods of
revolution leave men of our birth and opinions stranded wrecks of a
perished world. The emperor chooses his own advisers, and if they are
bad ones, his Majesty certainly will not ask Alain and me to replace
them."

"You do not answer--you evade me," said the Duchesse; with a mournful
smile. "You are too skilled a man of the world, Monsieur Enguerrand, not
to know that it is not only legislators and ministers that are necessary
to the support of a throne, and the safeguard of a nation. Do you not
see how great a help it is to both throne and nation when that section
of public opinion which is represented by names illustrious in history,
identified with records of chivalrous deeds and loyal devotion, rallies
round the order established? Let that section of public opinion stand
aloof, soured and discontented, excluded from active life, lending no
counter-balance to the perilous oscillations of democratic passion,
and tell me if it is not an enemy to itself as well as a traitor to the
principles it embodies?"

"The principles it embodies, Madame," said Alain, "are those of fidelity
to a race of kings unjustly set aside, less for the vices than the
virtues of ancestors. Louis XV. was the worst of the Bourbons,--he was
the bien aime: he escapes. Louis XVI. was in moral attributes the best
of the Bourbons,--he dies the death of a felon. Louis XVIII., against
whom much may be said, restored to the throne by foreign bayonets,
reigning as a disciple of Voltaire might reign, secretly scoffing alike
at the royalty and the religion which were crowned in his person, dies
peacefully in his bed. Charles X., redeeming the errors of his youth
by a reign untarnished by a vice, by a religion earnest and sincere, is
sent into exile for defending established order from the very inroads
which you lament. He leaves an heir against whom calumny cannot invent
a tale, and that heir remains an outlaw simply because he descends from
Henry IV., and has a right to reign. Madame, you appeal to us as among
the representatives of the chivalrous deeds and loyal devotion which
characterized the old nobility of France. Should we deserve that
character if we forsook the unfortunate, and gained wealth and honour in
forsaking?"

"Your words endear you to me. I am proud to call you cousin," said the
Duchesse. "But do you, or does any man in his senses believe that if you
upset the Empire you could get back the Bourbons; that you would not
be in imminent danger of a Government infinitely more opposed to the
theories on which rests the creed of Legitimists than that of Louis
Napoleon? After all, what is there in the loyalty of you Bourbonites
that has in it the solid worth of an argument which can appeal to the
comprehension of mankind, except it be the principle of a hereditary
monarchy? Nobody nowadays can maintain the right divine of a single
regal family to impose itself upon a nation. That dogma has ceased to be
a living principle; it is only a dead reminiscence. But the institution
of monarchy is a principle strong and vital, and appealing to the
practical interests of vast sections of society. Would you sacrifice
the principle which concerns the welfare of millions, because you
cannot embody it in the person of an individual utterly insignificant
in himself? In a word, if you prefer monarchy to the hazard of
republicanism for such a country as France, accept the monarchy you
find, since it is quite clear you cannot rebuild the monarchy you would
prefer. Does it not embrace all the great objects for which you call
yourself Legitimist? Under it religion is honoured, a national Church
secured, in reality if not in name; under it you have united the
votes of millions to the establishment of the throne; under it all
the material interests of the country, commercial, agricultural, have
advanced with an unequalled rapidity of progress; under it Paris has
become the wonder of the world for riches, for splendour, for grace and
beauty; under it the old traditional enemies of France have been humbled
and rendered impotent. The policy of Richelieu has been achieved in the
abasement of Austria; the policy of Napoleon I. has been consummated
in the salvation of Europe from the semi-barbarous ambition of Russia.
England no longer casts her trident in the opposition scale of the
balance of European power. Satisfied with the honour of our alliance,
she has lost every other ally; and her forces neglected, her spirit
enervated, her statesmen dreaming believers in the safety of their
island, provided they withdraw from the affairs of Europe, may sometimes
scold us, but will certainly not dare to fight. With France she is but
