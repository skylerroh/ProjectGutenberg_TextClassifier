  A country's ruins! to the seas are borne:
  Fierce Ajax thus o'erwhelms the yielding throng;
  Men, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along.

  But Hector, from this scene of slaughter far,
  Raged on the left, and ruled the tide of war:
  Loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain,
  And deep Scamander swells with heaps of slain.
  There Nestor and Idomeneus oppose
  The warrior's fury; there the battle glows;
  There fierce on foot, or from the chariot's height,
  His sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight.
  The spouse of Helen, dealing darts around,
  Had pierced Machaon with a distant wound:
  In his right shoulder the broad shaft appear'd,
  And trembling Greece for her physician fear'd.
  To Nestor then Idomeneus begun:
  "Glory of Greece, old Neleus' valiant son!
  Ascend thy chariot, haste with speed away,
  And great Machaon to the ships convey;
  A wise physician skill'd our wounds to heal,
  Is more than armies to the public weal."
  Old Nestor mounts the seat; beside him rode
  The wounded offspring of the healing god.
  He lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feet
  Shake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.

  But now Cebriones, from Hector's car,
  Survey'd the various fortune of the war:
  "While here (he cried) the flying Greeks are slain,
  Trojans on Trojans yonder load the plain.
  Before great Ajax see the mingled throng
  Of men and chariots driven in heaps along!
  I know him well, distinguish'd o'er the field
  By the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield.
  Thither, O Hector, thither urge thy steeds,
  There danger calls, and there the combat bleeds;
  There horse and foot in mingled deaths unite,
  And groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight."

  Thus having spoke, the driver's lash resounds;
  Swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds;
  Stung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields,
  O'er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields.
  The horses' hoofs are bathed in heroes' gore,
  And, dashing, purple all the car before;
  The groaning axle sable drops distils,
  And mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.
  Here Hector, plunging through the thickest fight,
  Broke the dark phalanx, and let in the light:
  (By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone.
  The ranks he scatter'd and the troops o'erthrown:)
  Ajax he shuns, through all the dire debate,
  And fears that arm whose force he felt so late.
  But partial Jove, espousing Hector's part,
  Shot heaven-bred horror through the Grecian's heart;
  Confused, unnerved in Hector's presence grown,
  Amazed he stood, with terrors not his own.
  O'er his broad back his moony shield he threw,
  And, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew.
  Thus the grim lion his retreat maintains,
  Beset with watchful dogs, and shouting swains;
  Repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls,
  Though rage impels him, and though hunger calls,
  Long stands the showering darts, and missile fires;
  Then sourly slow the indignant beast retires:
  So turn'd stern Ajax, by whole hosts repell'd,
  While his swoln heart at every step rebell'd.

  As the slow beast, with heavy strength endued,
  In some wide field by troops of boys pursued,
  Though round his sides a wooden tempest rain,
  Crops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain;
  Thick on his hide the hollow blows resound,
  The patient animal maintains his ground,
  Scarce from the field with all their efforts chased,
  And stirs but slowly when he stirs at last:
  On Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung,
  The strokes redoubled on his buckler rung;
  Confiding now in bulky strength he stands,
  Now turns, and backward bears the yielding bands;
  Now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,
  And threats his followers with retorted eye.
  Fix'd as the bar between two warring powers,
  While hissing darts descend in iron showers:
  In his broad buckler many a weapon stood,
  Its surface bristled with a quivering wood;
  And many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,
  Marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.
  But bold Eurypylus his aid imparts,
  And dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts;
  Whose eager javelin launch'd against the foe,
  Great Apisaon felt the fatal blow;
  From his torn liver the red current flow'd,
  And his slack knees desert their dying load.
  The victor rushing to despoil the dead,
  From Paris' bow a vengeful arrow fled;
  Fix'd in his nervous thigh the weapon stood,
  Fix'd was the point, but broken was the wood.
  Back to the lines the wounded Greek retired,
  Yet thus retreating, his associates fired:

  "What god, O Grecians! has your hearts dismay'd?
  Oh, turn to arms; 'tis Ajax claims your aid.
  This hour he stands the mark of hostile rage,
  And this the last brave battle he shall wage:
  Haste, join your forces; from the gloomy grave
  The warrior rescue, and your country save."
  Thus urged the chief: a generous troop appears,
  Who spread their bucklers, and advance their spears,
  To guard their wounded friend: while thus they stand
  With pious care, great Ajax joins the band:
  Each takes new courage at the hero's sight;
  The hero rallies, and renews the fight.

  Thus raged both armies like conflicting fires,
  While Nestor's chariot far from fight retires:
  His coursers steep'd in sweat, and stain'd with gore,
  The Greeks' preserver, great Machaon, bore.
  That hour Achilles, from the topmost height
  Of his proud fleet, o'erlook'd the fields of fight;
  His feasted eyes beheld around the plain
  The Grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain.
  His friend Machaon singled from the rest,
  A transient pity touch'd his vengeful breast.
  Straight to Menoetius' much-loved son he sent:
  Graceful as Mars, Patroclus quits his tent;
  In evil hour! Then fate decreed his doom,
  And fix'd the date of all his woes to come.

  "Why calls my friend? thy loved injunctions lay;
  Whate'er thy will, Patroclus shall obey."

  "O first of friends! (Pelides thus replied)
  Still at my heart, and ever at my side!
  The time is come, when yon despairing host
  Shall learn the value of the man they lost:
  Now at my knees the Greeks shall pour their moan,
  And proud Atrides tremble on his throne.
  Go now to Nestor, and from him be taught
  What wounded warrior late his chariot brought:
  For, seen at distance, and but seen behind,
  His form recall'd Machaon to my mind;
  Nor could I, through yon cloud, discern his face,
  The coursers pass'd me with so swift a pace."

  The hero said. His friend obey'd with haste,
  Through intermingled ships and tents he pass'd;
  The chiefs descending from their car he found:
  The panting steeds Eurymedon unbound.
  The warriors standing on the breezy shore,
  To dry their sweat, and wash away the gore,
  Here paused a moment, while the gentle gale
  Convey'd that freshness the cool seas exhale;
  Then to consult on farther methods went,
  And took their seats beneath the shady tent.
  The draught prescribed, fair Hecamede prepares,
  Arsinous' daughter, graced with golden hairs:
  (Whom to his aged arms, a royal slave,
  Greece, as the prize of Nestor's wisdom gave:)
  A table first with azure feet she placed;
  Whose ample orb a brazen charger graced;
  Honey new-press'd, the sacred flour of wheat,
  And wholesome garlic, crown'd the savoury treat,
  Next her white hand an antique goblet brings,
  A goblet sacred to the Pylian kings
  From eldest times: emboss'd with studs of gold,
  Two feet support it, and four handles hold;
  On each bright handle, bending o'er the brink,
  In sculptured gold, two turtles seem to drink:
  A massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him,
  When the brisk nectar overlook'd the brim.
  Temper'd in this, the nymph of form divine
  Pours a large portion of the Pramnian wine;
  With goat's-milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows,
  And last with flour the smiling surface strows:
  This for the wounded prince the dame prepares:
  The cordial beverage reverend Nestor shares:
  Salubrious draughts the warriors' thirst allay,
  And pleasing conference beguiles the day.

  Meantime Patroclus, by Achilles sent,
  Unheard approached, and stood before the tent.
  Old Nestor, rising then, the hero led
  To his high seat: the chief refused and said:

  "'Tis now no season for these kind delays;
  The great Achilles with impatience stays.
  To great Achilles this respect I owe;
  Who asks, what hero, wounded by the foe,
  Was borne from combat by thy foaming steeds?
  With grief I see the great Machaon bleeds.
  This to report, my hasty course I bend;
  Thou know'st the fiery temper of my friend."
  "Can then the sons of Greece (the sage rejoin'd)
  Excite compassion in Achilles' mind?
  Seeks he the sorrows of our host to know?
  This is not half the story of our woe.
  Tell him, not great Machaon bleeds alone,
  Our bravest heroes in the navy groan,
  Ulysses, Agamemnon, Diomed,
  And stern Eurypylus, already bleed.
  But, ah! what flattering hopes I entertain!
  Achilles heeds not, but derides our pain:
  Even till the flames consume our fleet he stays,
  And waits the rising of the fatal blaze.
  Chief after chief the raging foe destroys;
  Calm he looks on, and every death enjoys.
  Now the slow course of all-impairing time
  Unstrings my nerves, and ends my manly prime;
  Oh! had I still that strength my youth possess'd,
  When this bold arm the Epeian powers oppress'd,
  The bulls of Elis in glad triumph led,
  And stretch'd the great Itymonaeus dead!
  Then from my fury fled the trembling swains,
  And ours was all the plunder of the plains:
  Fifty white flocks, full fifty herds of swine,
  As many goats, as many lowing kine:
  And thrice the number of unrivall'd steeds,
  All teeming females, and of generous breeds.
  These, as my first essay of arms, I won;
  Old Neleus gloried in his conquering son.
  Thus Elis forced, her long arrears restored,
  And shares were parted to each Pylian lord.
  The state of Pyle was sunk to last despair,
  When the proud Elians first commenced the war:
  For Neleus' sons Alcides' rage had slain;
  Of twelve bold brothers, I alone remain!
  Oppress'd, we arm'd; and now this conquest gain'd,
  My sire three hundred chosen sheep obtain'd.
  (That large reprisal he might justly claim,
  For prize defrauded, and insulted fame,
  When Elis' monarch, at the public course,
  Detain'd his chariot, and victorious horse.)
  The rest the people shared; myself survey'd
  The just partition, and due victims paid.
  Three days were past, when Elis rose to war,
  With many a courser, and with many a car;
  The sons of Actor at their army's head
  (Young as they were) the vengeful squadrons led.
  High on the rock fair Thryoessa stands,
  Our utmost frontier on the Pylian lands:
  Not far the streams of famed Alphaeus flow:
  The stream they pass'd, and pitch'd their tents below.
  Pallas, descending in the shades of night,
  Alarms the Pylians and commands the fight.
  Each burns for fame, and swells with martial pride,
  Myself the foremost; but my sire denied;
  Fear'd for my youth, exposed to stern alarms;
  And stopp'd my chariot, and detain'd my arms.
  My sire denied in vain: on foot I fled
  Amidst our chariots; for the goddess led.

  "Along fair Arene's delightful plain
  Soft Minyas rolls his waters to the main:
  There, horse and foot, the Pylian troops unite,
  And sheathed in arms, expect the dawning light.
  Thence, ere the sun advanced his noon-day flame,
  To great Alphaeus' sacred source we came.
  There first to Jove our solemn rites were paid;
  An untamed heifer pleased the blue-eyed maid;
  A bull, Alphaeus; and a bull was slain
  To the blue monarch of the watery main.
  In arms we slept, beside the winding flood,
  While round the town the fierce Epeians stood.
  Soon as the sun, with all-revealing ray,
  Flamed in the front of Heaven, and gave the day.
  Bright scenes of arms, and works of war appear;
  The nations meet; there Pylos, Elis here.
  The first who fell, beneath my javelin bled;
  King Augias' son, and spouse of Agamede:
  (She that all simples' healing virtues knew,
  And every herb that drinks the morning dew:)
  I seized his car, the van of battle led;
  The Epeians saw, they trembled, and they fled.
  The foe dispersed, their bravest warrior kill'd,
  Fierce as the whirlwind now I swept the field:
  Full fifty captive chariots graced my train;
  Two chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain.
  Then Actor's sons had died, but Neptune shrouds
  The youthful heroes in a veil of clouds.
  O'er heapy shields, and o'er the prostrate throng,
  Collecting spoils, and slaughtering all along,
  Through wide Buprasian fields we forced the foes,
  Where o'er the vales the Olenian rocks arose;
  Till Pallas stopp'd us where Alisium flows.
  Even there the hindmost of the rear I slay,
  And the same arm that led concludes the day;
  Then back to Pyle triumphant take my way.
  There to high Jove were public thanks assign'd,
  As first of gods; to Nestor, of mankind.
  Such then I was, impell'd by youthful blood;
  So proved my valour for my country's good.

  "Achilles with unactive fury glows,
  And gives to passion what to Greece he owes.
  How shall he grieve, when to the eternal shade
  Her hosts shall sink, nor his the power to aid!
  0 friend! my memory recalls the day,
  When, gathering aids along the Grecian sea,
  I, and Ulysses, touch'd at Phthia's port,
  And entered Peleus' hospitable court.
  A bull to Jove he slew in sacrifice,
  And pour'd libations on the flaming thighs.
  Thyself, Achilles, and thy reverend sire
  Menoetius, turn'd the fragments on the fire.
  Achilles sees us, to the feast invites;
  Social we sit, and share the genial rites.
  We then explained the cause on which we came,
  Urged you to arms, and found you fierce for fame.
  Your ancient fathers generous precepts gave;
  Peleus said only this:--'My son! be brave.'
  Menoetius thus: 'Though great Achilles shine
  In strength superior, and of race divine,
  Yet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend;
  Let thy just counsels aid, and rule thy friend.'
  Thus spoke your father at Thessalia's court:
  Words now forgot, though now of vast import.
  Ah! try the utmost that a friend can say:
  Such gentle force the fiercest minds obey;
  Some favouring god Achilles' heart may move;
  Though deaf to glory, he may yield to love.
  If some dire oracle his breast alarm,
  If aught from Heaven withhold his saving arm,
  Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,
  If thou but lead the Myrmidonian line;
  Clad in Achilles' arms, if thou appear,
  Proud Troy may tremble, and desist from war;
  Press'd by fresh forces, her o'er-labour'd train
  Shall seek their walls, and Greece respire again."

  This touch'd his generous heart, and from the tent
  Along the shore with hasty strides he went;
  Soon as he came, where, on the crowded strand,
  The public mart and courts of justice stand,
  Where the tall fleet of great Ulysses lies,
  And altars to the guardian gods arise;
  There, sad, he met the brave Euaemon's son,
  Large painful drops from all his members run;
  An arrow's head yet rooted in his wound,
  The sable blood in circles mark'd the ground.
  As faintly reeling he confess'd the smart,
  Weak was his pace, but dauntless was his heart.
  Divine compassion touch'd Patroclus' breast,
  Who, sighing, thus his bleeding friend address'd:

  "Ah, hapless leaders of the Grecian host!
  Thus must ye perish on a barbarous coast?
  Is this your fate, to glut the dogs with gore,
  Far from your friends, and from your native shore?
  Say, great Eurypylus! shall Greece yet stand?
  Resists she yet the raging Hector's hand?
  Or are her heroes doom'd to die with shame,
  And this the period of our wars and fame?"

  Eurypylus replies: "No more, my friend;
  Greece is no more! this day her glories end;
  Even to the ships victorious Troy pursues,
  Her force increasing as her toil renews.
  Those chiefs, that used her utmost rage to meet,
  Lie pierced with wounds, and bleeding in the fleet.
  But, thou, Patroclus! act a friendly part,
  Lead to my ships, and draw this deadly dart;
  With lukewarm water wash the gore away;
  With healing balms the raging smart allay,
  Such as sage Chiron, sire of pharmacy,
  Once taught Achilles, and Achilles thee.
  Of two famed surgeons, Podalirius stands
  This hour surrounded by the Trojan bands;
  And great Machaon, wounded in his tent,
  Now wants that succour which so oft he lent."

  To him the chief: "What then remains to do?
  The event of things the gods alone can view.
  Charged by Achilles' great command I fly,
  And bear with haste the Pylian king's reply:
  But thy distress this instant claims relief."
  He said, and in his arms upheld the chief.
  The slaves their master's slow approach survey'd,
  And hides of oxen on the floor display'd:
  There stretch'd at length the wounded hero lay;
  Patroclus cut the forky steel away:
  Then in his hands a bitter root he bruised;
  The wound he wash'd, the styptic juice infused.
  The closing flesh that instant ceased to glow,
  The wound to torture, and the blood to flow.

BOOK XII.


ARGUMENT.

THE BATTLE AT THE GRECIAN WALL.

The Greeks having retired into their intrenchments, Hector attempts to
force them; but it proving impossible to pass the ditch, Polydamas advises
to quit their chariots, and manage the attack on foot. The Trojans follow
his counsel; and having divided their army into five bodies of foot, begin
the assault. But upon the signal of an eagle with a serpent in his talons,
which appeared on the left hand of the Trojans, Polydamas endeavours to
withdraw them again. This Hector opposes, and continues the attack; in
which, after many actions, Sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall.
Hector also, casting a stone of vast size, forces open one of the gates,
and enters at the head of his troops, who victoriously pursue the Grecians
even to their ships.

  While thus the hero's pious cares attend
  The cure and safety of his wounded friend,
  Trojans and Greeks with clashing shields engage,
  And mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage.
  Nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose;
  With gods averse the ill-fated works arose;
  Their powers neglected, and no victim slain,
  The walls were raised, the trenches sunk in vain.

  Without the gods, how short a period stands
  The proudest monument of mortal hands!
  This stood while Hector and Achilles raged.
  While sacred Troy the warring hosts engaged;
  But when her sons were slain, her city burn'd,
  And what survived of Greece to Greece return'd;
  Then Neptune and Apollo shook the shore,
  Then Ida's summits pour'd their watery store;
  Rhesus and Rhodius then unite their rills,
  Caresus roaring down the stony hills,
  AEsepus, Granicus, with mingled force,
  And Xanthus foaming from his fruitful source;
  And gulfy Simois, rolling to the main(224)
  Helmets, and shields, and godlike heroes slain:
  These, turn'd by Phoebus from their wonted ways,
  Deluged the rampire nine continual days;
  The weight of waters saps the yielding wall,
  And to the sea the floating bulwarks fall.
  Incessant cataracts the Thunderer pours,
  And half the skies descend in sluicy showers.
  The god of ocean, marching stern before,
  With his huge trident wounds the trembling shore,
  Vast stones and piles from their foundation heaves,
  And whelms the smoky ruin in the waves.
  Now smooth'd with sand, and levell'd by the flood,
  No fragment tells where once the wonder stood;
  In their old bounds the rivers roll again,
  Shine 'twixt the hills, or wander o'er the plain.(225)

  But this the gods in later times perform;
  As yet the bulwark stood, and braved the storm;
  The strokes yet echoed of contending powers;
  War thunder'd at the gates, and blood distain'd the towers.
  Smote by the arm of Jove with dire dismay,
  Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay:
  Hector's approach in every wind they hear,
  And Hector's fury every moment fear.
  He, like a whirlwind, toss'd the scattering throng,
  Mingled the troops, and drove the field along.
  So 'midst the dogs and hunters' daring bands,
  Fierce of his might, a boar or lion stands;
  Arm'd foes around a dreadful circle form,
  And hissing javelins rain an iron storm:
  His powers untamed, their bold assault defy,
  And where he turns the rout disperse or die:
  He foams, he glares, he bounds against them all,
  And if he falls, his courage makes him fall.
  With equal rage encompass'd Hector glows;
  Exhorts his armies, and the trenches shows.
  The panting steeds impatient fury breathe,
  And snort and tremble at the gulf beneath;
  Just at the brink they neigh, and paw the ground,
  And the turf trembles, and the skies resound.
  Eager they view'd the prospect dark and deep,
  Vast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep;
  The bottom bare, (a formidable show!)
  And bristled thick with sharpen'd stakes below.
  The foot alone this strong defence could force,
  And try the pass impervious to the horse.
  This saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave,
  Restrain'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:

  "O thou, bold leader of the Trojan bands!
  And you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands!
  What entrance here can cumbrous chariots find,
  The stakes beneath, the Grecian walls behind?
  No pass through those, without a thousand wounds,
  No space for combat in yon narrow bounds.
  Proud of the favours mighty Jove has shown,
  On certain dangers we too rashly run:
  If 'tis will our haughty foes to tame,
  Oh may this instant end the Grecian name!
  Here, far from Argos, let their heroes fall,
  And one great day destroy and bury all!
  But should they turn, and here oppress our train,
  What hopes, what methods of retreat remain?
  Wedged in the trench, by our own troops confused,
  In one promiscuous carnage crush'd and bruised,
  All Troy must perish, if their arms prevail,
  Nor shall a Trojan live to tell the tale.
  Hear then, ye warriors! and obey with speed;
  Back from the trenches let your steeds be led;
  Then all alighting, wedged in firm array,
  Proceed on foot, and Hector lead the way.
  So Greece shall stoop before our conquering power,
  And this (if Jove consent) her fatal hour."

                [Illustration: POLYDAMAS ADVISING HECTOR.]

                        POLYDAMAS ADVISING HECTOR.


  This counsel pleased: the godlike Hector sprung
  Swift from his seat; his clanging armour rung.
  The chief's example follow'd by his train,
  Each quits his car, and issues on the plain,
  By orders strict the charioteers enjoin'd
  Compel the coursers to their ranks behind.
  The forces part in five distinguish'd bands,
  And all obey their several chiefs' commands.
  The best and bravest in the first conspire,
  Pant for the fight, and threat the fleet with fire:
  Great Hector glorious in the van of these,
  Polydamas, and brave Cebriones.
  Before the next the graceful Paris shines,
  And bold Alcathous, and Agenor joins.
  The sons of Priam with the third appear,
  Deiphobus, and Helenas the seer;
  In arms with these the mighty Asius stood,
  Who drew from Hyrtacus his noble blood,
  And whom Arisba's yellow coursers bore,
  The coursers fed on Selle's winding shore.
  Antenor's sons the fourth battalion guide,
  And great AEneas, born on fountful Ide.
  Divine Sarpedon the last band obey'd,
  Whom Glaucus and Asteropaeus aid.
  Next him, the bravest, at their army's head,
  But he more brave than all the hosts he led.

  Now with compacted shields in close array,
  The moving legions speed their headlong way:
  Already in their hopes they fire the fleet,
  And see the Grecians gasping at their feet.

  While every Trojan thus, and every aid,
  The advice of wise Polydamas obey'd,
  Asius alone, confiding in his car,
  His vaunted coursers urged to meet the war.
  Unhappy hero! and advised in vain;
  Those wheels returning ne'er shall mark the plain;
  No more those coursers with triumphant joy
  Restore their master to the gates of Troy!
  Black death attends behind the Grecian wall,
  And great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall!
  Fierce to the left he drives, where from the plain
  The flying Grecians strove their ships to gain;
  Swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass'd,
  The gates half-open'd to receive the last.
  Thither, exulting in his force, he flies:
  His following host with clamours rend the skies:
  To plunge the Grecians headlong in the main,
  Such their proud hopes; but all their hopes were vain!

  To guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend,
  Who from the Lapiths' warlike race descend;
  This Polypoetes, great Perithous' heir,
  And that Leonteus, like the god of war.
  As two tall oaks, before the wall they rise;
  Their roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies:
  Whose spreading arms with leafy honours crown'd,
  Forbid the tempest, and protect the ground;
  High on the hills appears their stately form,
  And their deep roots for ever brave the storm.
  So graceful these, and so the shock they stand
  Of raging Asius, and his furious band.
  Orestes, Acamas, in front appear,
  And OEnomaus and Thoon close the rear:
  In vain their clamours shake the ambient fields,
  In vain around them beat their hollow shields;
  The fearless brothers on the Grecians call,
  To guard their navies, and defend the wall.
  Even when they saw Troy's sable troops impend,
  And Greece tumultuous from her towers descend,
  Forth from the portals rush'd the intrepid pair,
  Opposed their breasts, and stood themselves the war.
  So two wild boars spring furious from their den,
  Roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men;
  On every side the crackling trees they tear,
  And root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare;
  They gnash their tusks, with fire their eye-balls roll,
  Till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul.
  Around their heads the whistling javelins sung,
  With sounding strokes their brazen targets rung;
  Fierce was the fight, while yet the Grecian powers
  Maintain'd the walls, and mann'd the lofty towers:
  To save their fleet their last efforts they try,
  And stones and darts in mingled tempests fly.

  As when sharp Boreas blows abroad, and brings
  The dreary winter on his frozen wings;
  Beneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snow
  Descend, and whiten all the fields below:
  So fast the darts on either army pour,
  So down the rampires rolls the rocky shower:
  Heavy, and thick, resound the batter'd shields,
  And the deaf echo rattles round the fields.

  With shame repulsed, with grief and fury driven,
  The frantic Asius thus accuses Heaven:
  "In powers immortal who shall now believe?
  Can those too flatter, and can Jove deceive?
  What man could doubt but Troy's victorious power
  Should humble Greece, and this her fatal hour?
  But like when wasps from hollow crannies drive,
  To guard the entrance of their common hive,
  Darkening the rock, while with unwearied wings
  They strike the assailants, and infix their stings;
  A race determined, that to death contend:
  So fierce these Greeks their last retreats defend.
  Gods! shall two warriors only guard their gates,
  Repel an army, and defraud the fates?"

  These empty accents mingled with the wind,
  Nor moved great Jove's unalterable mind;
  To godlike Hector and his matchless might
  Was owed the glory of the destined fight.
  Like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried,
  And all the gates sustain'd an equal tide;
  Through the long walls the stony showers were heard,
  The blaze of flames, the flash of arms appear'd.
  The spirit of a god my breast inspire,
  To raise each act to life, and sing with fire!
  While Greece unconquer'd kept alive the war,
  Secure of death, confiding in despair;
  And all her guardian gods, in deep dismay,
  With unassisting arms deplored the day.

  Even yet the dauntless Lapithae maintain
  The dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain.
  First Damasus, by Polypoetes' steel,
  Pierced through his helmet's brazen visor, fell;
  The weapon drank the mingled brains and gore!
  The warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!
  Next Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath:
  Nor less Leonteus strews the field with death;
  First through the belt Hippomachus he gored,
  Then sudden waved his unresisted sword:
  Antiphates, as through the ranks he broke,
  The falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke:
  Iamenus, Orestes, Menon, bled;
  And round him rose a monument of dead.
  Meantime, the bravest of the Trojan crew,
  Bold Hector and Polydamas, pursue;
  Fierce with impatience on the works to fall,
  And wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.
  These on the farther bank now stood and gazed,
  By Heaven alarm'd, by prodigies amazed:
  A signal omen stopp'd the passing host,
  Their martial fury in their wonder lost.
  Jove's bird on sounding pinions beat the skies;
  A bleeding serpent of enormous size,
  His talons truss'd; alive, and curling round,
  He stung the bird, whose throat received the wound:
  Mad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey,
  In airy circles wings his painful way,
  Floats on the winds, and rends the heaven with cries:
  Amidst the host the fallen serpent lies.
  They, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll'd,
  And Jove's portent with beating hearts behold.
  Then first Polydamas the silence broke,
  Long weigh'd the signal, and to Hector spoke:

  "How oft, my brother, thy reproach I bear,
  For words well meant, and sentiments sincere?
  True to those counsels which I judge the best,
  I tell the faithful dictates of my breast.
  To speak his thoughts is every freeman's right,
  In peace, in war, in council, and in fight;
  And all I move, deferring to thy sway,
  But tends to raise that power which I obey.
  Then hear my words, nor may my words be vain!
  Seek not this day the Grecian ships to gain;
  For sure, to warn us, Jove his omen sent,
  And thus my mind explains its clear event:
  The victor eagle, whose sinister flight
  Retards our host, and fills our hearts with fright,
  Dismiss'd his conquest in the middle skies,
  Allow'd to seize, but not possess the prize;
  Thus, though we gird with fires the Grecian fleet,
  Though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet,
  Toils unforeseen, and fiercer, are decreed;
  More woes shall follow, and more heroes bleed.
  So bodes my soul, and bids me thus advise;
  For thus a skilful seer would read the skies."

  To him then Hector with disdain return'd:
  (Fierce as he spoke, his eyes with fury burn'd:)
  "Are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue?
  Thy will is partial, not thy reason wrong:
  Or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent,
  Sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent.
  What coward counsels would thy madness move
  Against the word, the will reveal'd of Jove?
  The leading sign, the irrevocable nod,
  And happy thunders of the favouring god,
  These shall I slight, and guide my wavering mind
  By wandering birds that flit with every wind?
  Ye vagrants of the sky! your wings extend,
  Or where the suns arise, or where descend;
  To right, to left, unheeded take your way,
  While I the dictates of high heaven obey.
  Without a sign his sword the brave man draws,
  And asks no omen but his country's cause.
  But why should'st thou suspect the war's success?
  None fears it more, as none promotes it less:
  Though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire,
  Trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire.
  Troy and her sons may find a general grave,
  But thou canst live, for thou canst be a slave.
  Yet should the fears that wary mind suggests
  Spread their cold poison through our soldiers' breasts,
  My javelin can revenge so base a part,
  And free the soul that quivers in thy heart."

  Furious he spoke, and, rushing to the wall,
  Calls on his host; his host obey the call;
  With ardour follow where their leader flies:
  Redoubling clamours thunder in the skies.
  Jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of Ide,
  And drifts of dust the clouded navy hide;
  He fills the Greeks with terror and dismay,
  And gives great Hector the predestined day.
  Strong in themselves, but stronger in his aid,
  Close to the works their rigid siege they laid.
  In vain the mounds and massy beams defend,
  While these they undermine, and those they rend;
  Upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall;
  And heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall.
  Greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms;
  The crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms,
  Shield touching shield, a long refulgent row;
  Whence hissing darts, incessant, rain below.
  The bold Ajaces fly from tower to tower,
  And rouse, with flame divine, the Grecian power.
  The generous impulse every Greek obeys;
  Threats urge the fearful; and the valiant, praise.

  "Fellows in arms! whose deeds are known to fame,
  And you, whose ardour hopes an equal name!
  Since not alike endued with force or art;
  Behold a day when each may act his part!
  A day to fire the brave, and warm the cold,
  To gain new glories, or augment the old.
  Urge those who stand, and those who faint, excite;
  Drown Hector's vaunts in loud exhorts of fight;
  Conquest, not safety, fill the thoughts of all;
  Seek not your fleet, but sally from the wall;
  So Jove once more may drive their routed train,
  And Troy lie trembling in her walls again."

  Their ardour kindles all the Grecian powers;
  And now the stones descend in heavier showers.
  As when high Jove his sharp artillery forms,
  And opes his cloudy magazine of storms;
  In winter's bleak un comfortable reign,
  A snowy inundation hides the plain;
  He stills the winds, and bids the skies to sleep;
  Then pours the silent tempest thick and deep;
  And first the mountain-tops are cover'd o'er,
  Then the green fields, and then the sandy shore;
  Bent with the weight, the nodding woods are seen,
  And one bright waste hides all the works of men:
  The circling seas, alone absorbing all,
  Drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall:
  So from each side increased the stony rain,
  And the white ruin rises o'er the plain.

  Thus godlike Hector and his troops contend
  To force the ramparts, and the gates to rend:
  Nor Troy could conquer, nor the Greeks would yield,
  Till great Sarpedon tower'd amid the field;
  For mighty Jove inspired with martial flame
  His matchless son, and urged him on to fame.
  In arms he shines, conspicuous from afar,
  And bears aloft his ample shield in air;
  Within whose orb the thick bull-hides were roll'd,
  Ponderous with brass, and bound with ductile gold:
  And while two pointed javelins arm his hands,
  Majestic moves along, and leads his Lycian bands.

  So press'd with hunger, from the mountain's brow
  Descends a lion on the flocks below;
  So stalks the lordly savage o'er the plain,
  In sullen majesty, and stern disdain:
  In vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar,
  And shepherds gall him with an iron war;
  Regardless, furious, he pursues his way;
  He foams, he roars, he rends the panting prey.

  Resolved alike, divine Sarpedon glows
  With generous rage that drives him on the foes.
  He views the towers, and meditates their fall,
  To sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall;
  Then casting on his friend an ardent look,
  Fired with the thirst of glory, thus he spoke:

  "Why boast we, Glaucus! our extended reign,(226)
  Where Xanthus' streams enrich the Lycian plain,
  Our numerous herds that range the fruitful field,
  And hills where vines their purple harvest yield,
  Our foaming bowls with purer nectar crown'd,
  Our feasts enhanced with music's sprightly sound?
  Why on those shores are we with joy survey'd,
  Admired as heroes, and as gods obey'd,
  Unless great acts superior merit prove,
  And vindicate the bounteous powers above?
  'Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace;
  The first in valour, as the first in place;
  That when with wondering eyes our martial bands
  Behold our deeds transcending our commands,
  Such, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state,
  Whom those that envy dare not imitate!
  Could all our care elude the gloomy grave,
  Which claims no less the fearful and the brave,
  For lust of fame I should not vainly dare
  In fighting fields, nor urge thy soul to war.
  But since, alas! ignoble age must come,
  Disease, and death's inexorable doom
  The life, which others pay, let us bestow,
  And give to fame what we to nature owe;
  Brave though we fall, and honour'd if we live,
  Or let us glory gain, or glory give!"

  He said; his words the listening chief inspire
  With equal warmth, and rouse the warrior's fire;
  The troops pursue their leaders with delight,
  Rush to the foe, and claim the promised fight.
  Menestheus from on high the storm beheld
  Threatening the fort, and blackening in the field:
  Around the walls he gazed, to view from far
  What aid appear'd to avert the approaching war,
  And saw where Teucer with the Ajaces stood,
  Of fight insatiate, prodigal of blood.
  In vain he calls; the din of helms and shields
  Rings to the skies, and echoes through the fields,
  The brazen hinges fly, the walls resound,
  Heaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground
  Then thus to Thoos: "Hence with speed (he said),
  And urge the bold Ajaces to our aid;
  Their strength, united, best may help to bear
  The bloody labours of the doubtful war:
  Hither the Lycian princes bend their course,
  The best and bravest of the hostile force.
  But if too fiercely there the foes contend,
  Let Telamon, at least, our towers defend,
  And Teucer haste with his unerring bow
  To share the danger, and repel the foe."

  Swift, at the word, the herald speeds along
  The lofty ramparts, through the martial throng,
  And finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore,
  Opposed in combat on the dusty shore.
  "Ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands!
  Your aid (said Thoos) Peteus' son demands;
  Your strength, united, best may help to bear
  The bloody labours of the doubtful war:
  Thither the Lycian princes bend their course,
  The best and bravest of the hostile force.
  But if too fiercely, here, the foes contend,
