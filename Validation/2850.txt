There was no sense to the note. There was no sense to anything that Vic
Butler did, for that matter. Where he hid away his vast scientific
knowledge in that rattle-brained, red-haired head of his has always been
a mystery to me. The note read:


     Dear Pete:

     If you get this, I'm in a jam that promises some action.

     Drive out, if plane-peddling is palling on you, and bust into
     the lab. I'm leaving another note there for you, old son, and
     after you read it you can let your conscience be your guide.

     Bring a gat along, and plenty of ammo. Hope's away, at Aunt
     Cleo's, so don't get in touch with her and spoil her visit.

comfortably in the shade of the big maples. Perrin, Vic's
man-of-all-work, came hurrying out of the house to greet me as I locked
my wheels on the drive before the door.

"I'm glad you're here, sir!" he exclaimed breathlessly. "I was just
about to phone for the police; I was for certain, sir. Such goings on, I
don't know what to think!"

"What's the matter, Perrin? Where's Mr. Butler?"

"That's it, sir! That's exactly it. Where's Mr. Butler? And--"

"Just a moment, please! Cut it short, Perrin. What's happened?"

"I don't know. Yesterday afternoon Mr. Butler leaves a letter for me,
which I'm to mail early this morning, special delivery. It's to you. I
reckon you got it, sir?"

"That's why I'm here. Go on."

"Well, after that, he locks himself up in his workroom, so Mrs. Perrin
