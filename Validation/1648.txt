           PREFATORY NOTE

           Previous to the year 1906 the researches of the Bureau were
           restricted to the American Indians, but by act of Congress
           approved June 30 of that year the scope of its operations was
           extended to include the natives of the Hawaiian islands.
           Funds were not specifically provided, however, for
           prosecuting investigations among these people, and in the
           absence of an appropriation for this purpose it was
           considered inadvisable to restrict the systematic
           investigations among the Indian tribes in order that the new
           field might be entered. Fortunately the publication of
           valuable data pertaining to Hawaii is already provided for,
           and the present memoir by Doctor Emerson is the first of the
           Bureau's Hawaiian series. It is expected that this Bulletin
           will be followed shortly by one comprising an extended list
           of works relating to Hawaii, compiled by Prof. H.M. Ballou
           and Dr. Cyrus Thomas.

                                   INTRODUCTION


           This book is for the greater part a collection of Hawaiian
           songs and poetic pieces that have done service from time
           immemorial as the stock supply of the _hula_. The  descriptive
           portions have been added, not because the poetical parts
           could not stand by themselves, but to furnish the proper
           setting and to answer the questions of those who want to
           know.

           Now, the hula stood for very much to the ancient Hawaiian; it
           was to him in place of our concert-hall and lecture-room, our
           opera and theater, and thus became one of his chief means of
           social enjoyment. Besides this, it kept the communal
           imagination in living touch with the nation's legendary past.
           The hula had songs proper to itself, but it found a mine of
           inexhaustible wealth in the epics and wonder-myths that
           celebrated the doings of the volcano goddess Pele and her
           compeers. Thus in the cantillations of the old-time hula we
           find a ready-made anthology that includes every species of
           composition in the whole range of Hawaiian poetry. This
           epic[1] of Pele was chiefly a more or less detached series of
           poems forming a story addressed not to the closet-reader, but
           to the eye and ear and heart of the assembled chiefs and
           people; and it was sung. The Hawaiian song, its note of joy
           par excellence, was the _oli_; but it must be noted that in
           every species of Hawaiian poetry, _mele_--whether epic or
           eulogy or prayer, sounding through them all we shall find the
           lyric note.

           [Footnote 1: It might be termed a handful of lyrics strung on
           an epic thread.]

           The most telling record of a people's intimate life is the
           record which it unconsciously makes in its songs. This record
           which the Hawaiian people have left of themselves is full and
           specific. When, therefore, we ask what emotions stirred the
           heart of the old-time Hawaiian as he approached the great
           themes of life and death, of ambition and jealousy, of sexual
           passion, of romantic love, of conjugal love, and parental
           love, what his attitude toward nature and the dread forces of
           earthquake and storm, and the mysteries of spirit and the
           hereafter, we shall find our answer in the songs and prayers
           and recitations of the hula.

           The hula, it is true, has been unfortunate in the mode and
           manner of its introduction to us moderns. An institution of
           divine, that is, religious, origin, the hula in modern times
[Page 8]   has wandered so far and fallen so low that foreign and
           critical esteem has come to associate it with the riotous and
           passionate ebullitions of Polynesian kings and the amorous
           posturing of their voluptuaries. We must make a just
           distinction, however, between the gestures and bodily
           contortions presented by the men and women, the actors in the
           hula, and their uttered words. "The voice is Jacob's voice,
           but the hands are the hands of Esau." In truth, the actors in
           the hula no longer suit the action to the word. The utterance
           harks back to the golden age; the gesture is trumped up by
           the passion of the hour, or dictated by the master of the
           hula, to whom the real meaning of the old bards is ofttimes a
           sealed casket.
           Whatever indelicacy attaches in modern times to some of the
           gestures and contortions of the hula dancers, the old-time
           hula songs in large measure were untainted with grossness. If
           there ever were a Polynesian Arcadia, and if it were possible
           for true reports of the doings and sayings of the Polynesians
           to reach us from that happy land--reports of their joys and
           sorrows, their love-makings and their jealousies, their
           family spats and reconciliations, their worship of beauty and
           of the gods and goddesses who walked in the garden of
           beauty--we may say, I think, that such a report would be in
           substantial agreement with the report that is here offered;
           but, if one's virtue will not endure the love-making of
           Arcadia, let him banish the myth from his imagination and hie
           to a convent or a nunnery.

           If this book does nothing more than prove that savages are
           only children of a younger growth than ourselves, that what
           we find them to have been we ourselves--in our
           ancestors--once were, the labor of making it will have been
           not in vain'.

           For an account of the first hula we may look to the story of
           Pele. On one occasion that goddess begged her sisters to
           dance and sing before her, but they all excused themselves,
           saying they did not know the art. At that moment in came
           little Hiiaka, the youngest and the favorite. Unknown to her
           sisters, the little maiden had practised the dance under the
           tuition of her friend, the beautiful but ill-fated Hopoe.
           When banteringly invited to dance, to the surprise of all,
           Hiiaka modestly complied. The wave-beaten sand-beach was her
           floor, the open air her hall; Feet and hands and swaying form
           kept time to her improvisation:

                Look, Puna is a-dance in the wind;
                The palm groves of Kea-au shaken.
                Haena and the woman Hopoe dance and sing
                On the beach Nana-huki,
                A dance of purest delight,
                Down by the sea Nana-huki.

           The nature of this work has made it necessary to use
           occasional Hawaiian words in the technical parts. At their
[Page 9]   first introduction it has seemed fitting that they should be
           distinguished by italics; but, once given the entree, it is
           assumed that, as a rule, they will be granted the rights of
           free speech without further explanation.

           A glossary, which explains all the Hawaiian words used in the
           prose text, is appended. Let no one imagine, however, that by
           the use of this little crutch alone he will be enabled to
           walk or stumble through the foreign ways of the simplest
           Hawaiian _mele_. Notes, often copious, have been appended to
           many of the mele, designed to exhaust neither the subject nor
           the reader, but to answer some of the questions of the
           intelligent thinker.

           Thanks, many thanks, are due, first, to those native
           Hawaiians who have so far broken with the old superstitious
           tradition of concealment as to unearth so much of the
           unwritten literary wealth stored in Hawaiian memories;
           second, to those who have kindly contributed criticism,
           suggestion, material at the different stages of this book's
           progress; and, lastly, to those dear friends of the author's
           youth--living or dead--whose kindness has made it possible to
           send out this fledgling to the world. The author feels under
           special obligations to Dr. Titus Munson Coan, of New York,
           for a painstaking revision of the manuscript.

                             LITERATURE OF HAWAII

                           By NATHANIEL B. EMERSON



                                I.--THE HULA

           One turns from the study of old genealogies, myths, and
           traditions of the Hawaiians with a hungry despair at finding
           in them means so small for picturing the people themselves,
           their human interests and passions; but when it comes to the
           hula and the whole train of feelings and sentiments that made
           their entrances and exits in the _halau_ (the hall of the
           hula) one perceives that in this he has found the door to the
           heart of the people. So intimate and of so simple confidence
           are the revelations the people make of themselves in their
           songs and prattlings that when one undertakes to report what
           he has heard and to translate into the terms of modern speech
           what he has received in confidence, as it were, he almost
           blushes, as if he had been guilty of spying on Adam and Eve
           in their nuptial bower. Alas, if one could but muffle his
           speech with the unconscious lisp of infancy, or veil and tone
           his picture to correspond to the perspective of antiquity, he
           might feel at least that, like Watteau, he had dealt
           worthily, if not truly, with that ideal age which we ever
           think of as the world's garden period.

           The Hawaiians, it is true, were many removes from being
           primitives; their dreams, however, harked back to a period
           that was close to the world's infancy. Their remote ancestry
           was, perhaps, akin to ours--Aryan, at least Asiatic--but the
           orbit of their evolution seems to have led them away from the
           strenuous discipline that has whipped the Anglo-Saxon branch
           into fighting shape with fortune.

           If one comes to the study of the hula and its songs in the
           spirit of a censorious moralist he will find nothing for him;
           if as a pure ethnologist, he will take pleasure in pointing
           out the physical resemblances of the Hawaiian dance to the
           languorous grace of the Nautch girls, of the geisha, and
           other oriental dancers. But if he comes as a student and
           lover of human nature, back of the sensuous posturings, in
           the emotional language of the songs he will find himself
           entering the playground of the human race.

           The hula was a religious service, in which poetry, music,
           pantomime, and the dance lent themselves, under the forms of
[Page 12]  dramatic art, to the refreshment of men's minds. Its view of
           life was idyllic, and it gave itself to the celebration of
           those mythical times when gods and goddesses moved on the
           earth as men and women and when men and women were as gods.
           As to subject-matter, its warp was spun largely from the
           bowels of the old-time mythology into cords through which the
           race maintained vital connection with its mysterious past.
           Interwoven with these, forming the woof, were threads of a
           thousand hues and of many fabrics, representing the
           imaginations of the poet, the speculations of the
           philosopher, the aspirations of many a thirsty soul, as well
           as the ravings and flame-colored pictures of the sensualist,
           the mutterings and incantations of the _kahuna_, the
           mysteries and paraphernalia of Polynesian mythology, the
           annals of the nation's history--the material, in fact, which
           in another nation and under different circumstances would
           have gone to the making of its poetry, its drama, its opera,
           its literature.

           The people were superstitiously religious; one finds their
           drama saturated with religious feeling, hedged about with
           tabu, loaded down with prayer and sacrifice. They were
           poetical; nature was full of voices for their ears; their
           thoughts came to them as images; nature was to them an
           allegory; all this found expression in their dramatic art.
           They were musical; their drama must needs be cast in forms to
           suit their ideas of rhythm, of melody, and of poetic harmony.
           They were, moreover, the children of passion, sensuous,
           worshipful of whatever lends itself to pleasure. How, then,
           could the dramatic efforts of this primitive people, still in
           the bonds of animalism, escape the note of passion? The songs
           and other poetic pieces which have come down to us from the
           remotest antiquity are generally inspired with a purer
           sentiment and a loftier purpose than the modern; and it may
           be said of them all that when they do step into the mud it is
           not to tarry and wallow in it; it is rather with the
           unconscious naivete of a child thinking no evil.

           On the principle of "the terminal conversion of opposites,"
           which the author once heard an old philosopher expound, the
           most advanced modern is better able to hark back to the
           sweetness and light and music of the primeval world than the
           veriest wigwam-dweller that ever chipped an arrowhead. It is
           not so much what the primitive man can give us as what we can
           find in him that is worth our while. The light that a Goethe,
           a Thoreau, or a Kipling can project into Arcadia is mirrored
           in his own nature.

           If one mistakes not the temper and mind of this generation,
           we are living in an age that is not content to let perish one
           seed of thought or one single phase of life that can be
           rescued from the drift of time. We mourn the extinction of
           the buffalo of the plains and of the birds of the islands,
[Page 13]  rightly thinking that life is somewhat less rich and full
           without them. What of the people of the plains and of the
           islands of the sea? Is their contribution so nothingless that
           one can affirm that the orbit of man's mind is complete
           without it?

           Comparison is unavoidable between the place held by the dance
           in ancient Hawaii and that occupied by the dance in our
           modern society. The ancient Hawaiians did not personally and
           informally indulge in the dance for their own amusement, as
           does pleasure-loving society at the present time. Like the
           Shah of Persia, but for very different reasons, Hawaiians of
           the old time left it to be done for them by a body of trained
           and paid performers. This was not because the art and
           practice of the hula were held in disrepute--quite the
           reverse--but because the hula was an accomplishment requiring
           special education and arduous training in both song and
           dance, and more especially because it was a religious matter,
           to be guarded against profanation by the observance of tabus
           and the performance of priestly rites.

           This fact, which we find paralleled in every form of communal
           amusement, sport, and entertainment in ancient Hawaii, sheds
           a strong light on the genius of the Hawaiian. We are wont to
           think of the old-time Hawaiians as light-hearted children of
           nature, given to spontaneous outbursts of song and dance as
           the mood seized them; quite as the rustics of "merrie
           England" joined hands and tripped "the light fantastic toe"
           in the joyous month of May or shouted the harvest home at a
           later season. The genius of the Hawaiian was different. With
           him the dance was an affair of premeditation, an organized
           effort, guarded by the traditions of a somber religion. And
           this characteristic, with qualifications, will be found to
           belong to popular Hawaiian sport and amusement of every
           variety. Exception must be made, of course, of the
           unorganized sports of childhood. One is almost inclined to
           generalize and to say that those children of nature, as we
           are wont to call them, in this regard were less free and
           spontaneous than the more advanced race to which we are proud
           to belong. But if the approaches to the temple of Terpsichore
           with them were more guarded, we may confidently assert that
           their enjoyment therein was deeper and more abandoned.

                   II.--THE HALAU; THE KUAHU--THEIR DECORATION
                                AND CONSECRATION

                                   THE HALAU

           In building a halau, or hall, in which to perform the hula a
           Hawaiian of the old, old time was making a temple for his
           god. In later and degenerate ages almost any structure would
           serve the purpose; it might be a flimsy shed or an
           extemporaneous _lanai_ such as is used to shelter that _al
           fresco_ entertainment, the _luau_. But in the old times of
           strict tabu and rigorous etiquette, when the chief had but to
           lift his hand and the entire population of a district
           ransacked plain, valley, and mountain to collect the poles,
           beams, thatch, and cordstuff; when the workers were so
           numerous that the structure grew and took shape in a day, we
           may well believe that ambitious and punctilious patrons of
           the hula, such as La'a, Liloa, or Lono-i-ka-makahiki, did not
           allow the divine art of Laka to house in a barn.

           The choice of a site was a matter of prime importance. A
           formidable code enunciated the principles governing the
           selection. But--a matter of great solicitude--there were
           omens to be heeded, snares and pitfalls devised by the
           superstitious mind for its own entanglement. The untimely
           sneeze, the ophthalmic eye, the hunched back were omens to be
           shunned.

           Within historic times, since the abrogation of the tabu
           system and the loosening of the old polytheistic ideas, there
           has been in the hula a lowering of former standards, in some
           respects a degeneration. The old gods, however, were not
           entirely dethroned; the people of the hula still continued to
           maintain the form of divine service and still appealed to
           them for good luck; but the soul of worship had exhaled; the
           main study now was to make of the hula a pecuniary success.

           In an important sense the old way was in sympathy with the
           thought, "Except God be with the workmen, they labor in vain
           that build the house." The means for gaining divine favor and
           averting the frown of the gods were those practised by all
           religionists in the infantile state of the human mind--the
