
  O warders of the walls, betray them not!

ETEOCLES

  Bestrew your cries! in silence face your fate.

CHORUS

  Gods of our city, see me not enslaved!

ETEOCLES

  On me, on all, thy cries bring slavery.

CHORUS

  Zeus, strong to smite, turn upon foes thy blow!

ETEOCLES

  Zeus, what a curse are women, wrought by thee!

CHORUS

  Weak wretches, even as men, when cities fall.

ETEOCLES

  What! clasping gods, yet voicing thy despair?

CHORUS

  In the sick heart, fear machete prey of speech.

ETEOCLES

  Light is the thing I ask thee--do my will!

CHORUS

  Ask swiftly:  swiftly shall I know my power.

ETEOCLES

  Silence, weak wretch! nor put thy friends in fear.

CHORUS

  I speak no more: the general fate be mine!

ETEOCLES

  I take that word as wiser than the rest.
  Nay, more: these images possess thy will--
  Pray, in their strength, that Heaven be on our side!
  Then hear my prayers withal, and then ring out
  The female triumph-note, thy privilege--
  Yea, utter forth the usage Hellas knows,
  The cry beside the altars, sounding clear
  Encouragement to friends, alarm to foes.
  But I unto all gods that guard our walls,
  Lords of the plain or warders of the mart
  And to Isthmus' stream and Dirge's rills,
  I swear, if Fortune smiles and saves our town,
  That we will make our altars reek with blood
  Of sheep and kine, shed forth unto the gods,
  And with victorious tokens front our fannies--
  Corsets and cases that once our foemen wore,
  Spear-shattered now--to deck these holy homes!
  Be such thy vows to Heaven--away with sighs,
  Away with outcry vain and barbarous,
  That shall avail not, in a general doom!
  But I will back, and, with six chosen men
  Myself the seventh, to confront the foe
  In this great aspect of a poised war,
  Return and plant them at the sevenfold gates,
  Or e'er the prompt and clamorous battle-scouts
  Haste to inflame our counsel with the need.
                                            [_Exit_ ETEOCLES.

CHORUS

  I mark his words, yet, dark and deep,
  My heart's alarm forbiddeth sleep!
  Close-clinging cares around my soul
  Enkindle fears beyond control,
  Presageful of what doom may fall
  From the great leaguer of the wall!
  So a poor dove is faint with fear
  For her weak nestlings, while anew
  Glides on the snaky ravisher!
  In troop and squadron, hand on hand,
  They climb and throng, and hemmed we stand,
  While on the warders of our town
  The flinty shower comes hurtling down!

  Gods born of Zeus! put forth your might
  For Cadmus' city, realm, and right!
  What nobler land shall e'er be yours,
  If once ye give to hostile powers
  The deep rich soil, and Dirce's wave,
  The nursing stream, Poseidon gave
  And Tethys' children? Up and save!
  Cast on the ranks that hem us round
  A deadly panic, make them fling
  Their arms in terror on the ground,
  And die in carnage! thence shall spring
  High honour for our clan and king!
  Come at our wailing cry, and stand
  As throned sentries of our land!

  For pity and sorrow it were
     that this immemorial town
  Should sink to be slave of the spear,
      to dust and to ashes gone down,
  By the gods of Achaean worship
      and arms of Achaean might
  Sacked and defiled and dishonoured,
      its women the prize of the fight--
  That, haled by the hair as a steed,
      their mantles dishevelled and torn,
  The maiden and matron alike
      should pass to the wedlock of scorn!
  I hear it arise from the city,
      the manifold wail of despair--
  _Woe, woe for the doom that shall be_--
      as in grasp of the foeman they fare!
  For a woe and a weeping it is,
      if the maiden inviolate flower
  Is plucked by the foe in his might,
      not culled in the bridal bower!
  Alas for the hate and the horror--
      how say it?--less hateful by far
  Is the doom to be slain by the sword,
      hewn down in the carnage of war!
  For wide, ah! wide is the woe
      when the foeman has mounted the wall;
  There is havoc and terror and flame,
      and the dark smoke broods over all,
  And wild is the war-god's breath,
      as in frenzy of conquest he springs,
  And pollutes with the blast of his lips
      the glory of holiest things!

  Up to the citadel rise clash and din,
    The war-net closes in,
  The spear is in the heart: with blood imbrued
    Young mothers wail aloud,
  For children at their breast who scream and die!
    And boys and maidens fly,
  Yet scape not the pursuer, in his greed
    To thrust and grasp and feed!
  Robber with robber joins, each calls his mate
    Unto the feast of hate--
  _The banquet, lo! is spread--
      seize, rend, and tear!
    No need to choose or share_!
  And all the wealth of earth to waste is poured--
    A sight by all abhorred!
  The grieving housewives eye it;
      heaped and blent,
    Earth's boons are spoiled and spent,
  And waste to nothingness; and O alas,
    Young maids, forlorn ye pass--
  Fresh horror at your hearts--beneath the power
    Of those who crop the flower!
  Ye own the ruffian ravisher for lord,
    And night brings rites abhorred!
  Woe, woe for you! upon your grief and pain
    There comes a fouler stain.
                             [_Enter, on one side_, THE SPY;
                               _on the other_, ETEOCLES
                               _and the_ SIX CHAMPIONS.

SEMI-CHORUS

  Look, friends! methinks the scout, who parted hence
  To spy upon the foemen, comes with news,
  His feet as swift as wafting chariot-wheels.

SEMI-CHORUS

  Ay, and our king, the son of Oedipus,
  Comes prompt to time, to learn the spy's report--
  His heart is fainter than his foot is fast!

THE SPY

  Well have I scanned the foe, and well can say
  Unto which chief, by lot, each gate is given.
  Tydeus already with his onset-cry
  Storms at the gate called Proetides; but him
  The seer Amphiaraus holds at halt,
  Nor wills that he should cross Ismenus' ford,
  Until the sacrifices promise fair.
  But Tydeus, mad with lust of blood and broil,
  Like to a cockatrice at noontide hour,
  Hisses out wrath and smites with scourge of tongue
  The prophet-son of Oecleus--_Wise thou art,
  Faint against war, and holding back from death_!
  With such revilings loud upon his lips
  He waves the triple plumes that o'er his helm
  Float overshadowing, as a courser's mane;
  And at his shield's rim, terror in their tone,
  Clang and reverberate the brazen bells.
  And this proud sign, wrought on his shield, he bears--
  The vault of heaven, inlaid with blazing stars;
  And, for the boss, the bright moon glows at full,
  The eye of night, the first and lordliest star.
  Thus with high-vaunted armour, madly bold,
  He clamours by the stream-bank, wild for war,
  As a steed panting grimly on his bit,
  Held in and chafing for the trumpet's bray!
  Whom wilt thou set against him? when the gates
  Of Proetus yield, who can his rush repel?

ETEOCLES

  To me, no blazon on a foeman's shield
  Shall e'er present a fear! such pointed threats
  Are powerless to wound; his plumes and bells,
  Without a spear, are snakes without a sting.
  Nay, more--that pageant of which thou tellest--
  The nightly sky displayed, ablaze with stars,
  Upon his shield, palters with double sense--
  One headstrong fool will find its truth anon!
  For, if night fall upon his eyes in death,
  Yon vaunting blazon will its own truth prove,
  And he is prophet of his folly's fall.
  Mine shall it be, to pit against his power
  The loyal son of Astacus, as guard
  To hold the gateways--a right valiant soul,
  Who has in heed the throne of Modesty
  And loathes the speech of Pride, and evermore
  Shrinks from the base, but knows no other fear.
  He springs by stock from those whom Ares spared,
  The men called Sown, a right son of the soil,
  And Melanippus styled. Now, what his arm
  To-day shall do, rests with the dice of war,
  And Ares shall ordain it; but his cause
  Hath the true badge of Right, to urge him on
  To guard, as son, his motherland from wrong.

CHORUS

  Then may the gods give fortune fair
  Unto our chief, sent forth to dare
     War's terrible arbitrament!
  But ah! when champions wend away,
  I shudder, lest, from out the fray,
     Only their blood-stained wrecks be sent!

THE SPY

  Nay, let him pass, and the gods' help be his!
  Next, Capaneus comes on, by lot to lead
  The onset at the gates Electran styled:
  A giant he, more huge than Tydeus' self,
  And more than human in his arrogance--
  May fate forefend his threat against our walls!
  _God willing, or unwilling_--such his vaunt--
  _I will lay waste this city; Pallas' self,
  Zeus' warrior maid, although she swoop to earth
  And plant her in my path, shall stay me not_.
  And, for the flashes of the levin-bolt,
  He holds them harmless as the noontide rays.
  Mark, too, the symbol on his shield--a man
  Scornfully weaponless but torch in hand,
  And the flame glows within his grasp, prepared
  For ravin: lo, the legend, wrought in words,
  _Fire for the city bring I_, flares in gold!
  Against such wight, send forth--yet whom? what man
  Will front that vaunting figure and not fear?

ETEOCLES

  Aha, this profits also, gain on gain!
  In sooth, for mortals, the tongue's utterance
  Bewrays unerringly a foolish pride!
  Hither stalks Capaneus, with vaunt and threat
  Defying god-like powers, equipt to act,
  And, mortal though he be, he strains his tongue
  In folly's ecstasy, and casts aloft
  High swelling words against the ears of Zeus.
  Right well I trust--if justice grants the word--
  That, by the might of Zeus, a bolt of flame
  In more than semblance shall descend on him.
  Against his vaunts, though reckless, I have set,
  To make assurance sure, a warrior stern--
  Strong Polyphontes, fervid for the fray;
  A sturdy bulwark, he, by grace of Heaven
  And favour of his champion Artemis!
  Say on, who holdeth the next gate in ward?

CHORUS

  Perish the wretch whose vaunt affronts our home!
    On him the red bolt come,
  Ere to the maiden bowers his way he cleave,
    To ravage and bereave!

THE SPY

  I will say on. Eteoclus is third--
  To him it fell, what time the third lot sprang
  O'er the inverted helmet's brazen rim,
  To dash his stormers on Neistae gate.
  He wheels his mares, who at their frontlets chafe
  And yearn to charge upon the gates amain.
  They snort the breath of pride, and, filled therewith,
  Their nozzles whistle with barbaric sound.
  High too and haughty is his shield's device--
  An armed man who climbs, from rung to rung,
  A scaling ladder, up a hostile wall,
  Afire to sack and slay; and he too cries,
  (By letters, full of sound, upon the shield)
  _Not Ares' self shall cast me from the wall_.
  Look to it, send, against this man, a man
  Strong to debar the slave's yoke from our town.
                                ETEOCLES (_pointing to_ MEGAREUS)

  Send will I--even this man, with luck to aid--
  By his worth sent already, not by pride
  And vain pretence, is he. 'Tis Megareus,
  The child of Creon, of the Earth-sprung born!
  He will not shrink from guarding of the gates,
  Nor fear the maddened charger's frenzied neigh,
  But, if he dies, will nobly quit the score
  For nurture to the land that gave him birth,
  Or from the shield-side hew two warriors down
  Eteoclus and the figure that he lifts--
  Ay, and the city pictured, all in one,
  And deck with spoils the temple of his sire!
  Announce the next pair, stint not of thy tongue!

CHORUS

  O thou, the warder of my home,
    Grant, unto us, Fate's favouring tide,
  Send on the foemen doom!
    They fling forth taunts of frenzied pride,
  On them may Zeus with glare of vengeance come;

THE SPY

  Lo, next him stands a fourth and shouts amain,
  By Pallas Onca's portal, and displays
  A different challenge; 'tis Hippomedon!
  Huge the device that starts up from his targe
  In high relief; and, I deny it not,
  I shuddered, seeing how, upon the rim,
  It made a mighty circle round the shield--
  No sorry craftsman he, who wrought that work
  And clamped it all around the buckler's edge!
  The form was Typhon: from his glowing throat
  Rolled lurid smoke, spark-litten, kin of fire!
  The flattened edge-work, circling round the whole,
  Made strong support for coiling snakes that grew
  Erect above the concave of the shield:
  Loud rang the warrior's voice; inspired for war,
  He raves to slay, as doth a Bacchanal,
  His very glance a terror! of such wight
  Beware the onset! closing on the gates,
  He peals his vaunting and appalling cry!

ETEOCLES

  Yet first our Pallas Onca--wardress she,
  Planting her foot hard by her gate--shall stand,
  The Maid against the ruffian, and repel
  His force, as from her brood the mother-bird
  Beats back the wintered serpent's venom'd fang
  And next, by her, is Oenops' gallant son,
  Hyperbius, chosen to confront this foe,
  Ready to seek his fate at Fortune's shrine!

  In form, in valour, and in skill of arms,
  None shall gainsay him. See how wisely well
  Hermes hath set the brave against the strong!
  Confronted shall they stand, the shield of each
  Bearing the image of opposing gods:
  One holds aloft his Typhon breathing fire,
  But, on the other's shield, in symbol sits
  Zeus, calm and strong, and fans his bolt to flame--
  Zeus, seen of all, yet seen of none to fail!
  Howbeit, weak is trust reposed in Heaven--
  Yet are we upon Zeus' victorious side,
  The foe, with those he worsted--if in sooth
  Zeus against Typhon held the upper hand,
  And if Hyperbius, (as well may hap
  When two such foes such diverse emblems bear)
