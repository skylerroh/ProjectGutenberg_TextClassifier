At the first grey streak of dawn he went out of the great door of the
church, called the sentry, who was one of his own guard, and bade him
privately, and now ere the world was astir, convey the prisoner to one
of the private dungeons of the Capitol. "Be silent," said he: "utter not
a word of this to any one; be obedient, and thou shalt be promoted. This
done, find out the councillor, Pandulfo di Guido, and bid him seek me
here ere the crowd assemble."

He then, making the sentinel doff his heavy shoes of iron, led him
across the church, resigned Rodolf to his care, saw them depart, and
in a few minutes afterwards his voice was heard by the inmates of the
neighbouring chapel; and he was soon surrounded by his train.

He was already standing on the floor, wrapped in a large gown lined with
furs; and his piercing eye scanned carefully the face of each man that
approached. Two of the Barons of the Frangipani family exhibited
some tokens of confusion and embarrassment, from which they speedily
recovered at the frank salutation of the Tribune.

But all the art of Savelli could not prevent his features from betraying
to the most indifferent eye the terror of his soul;--and, when he felt
the penetrating gaze of Rienzi upon him, he trembled in every joint.
Rienzi alone did not, however, seem to notice his disorder; and when
Vico di Scotto, an old knight, from whose hands he received his sword,
asked him how he had passed the night, he replied, cheerfully--

"Well, well--my brave friend! Over a maiden knight some good angel
always watches. Signor Luca di Savelli, I fear you have slept but ill:
you seem pale. No matter!--our banquet today will soon brighten the
current of your gay blood."

"Blood, Tribune!" said di Scotto, who was innocent of the plot: "Thou
sayest blood, and lo! on the floor are large gouts of it not yet dry."

"Now, out on thee, old hero, for betraying my awkwardness! I pricked
myself with my own dagger in unrobing. Thank Heaven it hath no poison in
its blade!"

The Frangipani exchanged looks,--Luca di Savelli clung to a column for
support,--and the rest of the attendants seemed grave and surprised.

"Think not of it, my masters," said Rienzi: "it is a good omen,
and a true prophecy. It implies that he who girds on his sword
for the good of the state, must be ready to spill his blood for it:
that am I. No more of this--a mere scratch: it gave more
blood than I recked of from so slight a puncture, and saves
the leech the trouble of the lancet. How brightly breaks the day!
We must prepare to meet our fellow-citizens--they will be here anon.
Ha, my Pandulfo--welcome!--thou, my old friend, shalt buckle on this
mantle!"

And while Pandulfo was engaged in the task, the Tribune whispered a few
words in his ear, which, by the smile on his countenance, seemed to the
attendants one of the familiar jests with which Rienzi distinguished his
intercourse with his more confidential intimates.



Chapter 4.VI. The Celebrated Citation.

The bell of the great Lateran church sounded shrill and loud, as the
mighty multitude, greater even than that of the preceding night, swept
on. The appointed officers made way with difficulty for the barons and
ambassadors, and scarcely were those noble visitors admitted ere the
crowd closed in their ranks, poured headlong into the church, and took
the way to the chapel of Boniface VIII. There, filling every cranny,
and blocking up the entrance, the more fortunate of the press beheld the
Tribune surrounded by the splendid court his genius had collected, and
his fortune had subdued. At length, as the solemn and holy music began
to swell through the edifice, preluding the celebration of the mass, the
Tribune stepped forth, and the hush of the music was increased by the
universal and dead silence of the audience. His height, his air, his
countenance, were such as always command the attention of crowds; and at
this time they received every adjunct from the interest of the occasion,
and that peculiar look of intent yet suppressed fervour, which is,
perhaps, the sole gift of the eloquent that Nature alone can give.

"Be it known," said he, slowly and deliberately, "in virtue of that
authority, power, and jurisdiction, which the Roman people, in general
parliament, have assigned to us, and which the Sovereign Pontiff hath
confirmed, that we, not ungrateful of the gift and grace of the Holy
Spirit--whose soldier we now are--nor of the favour of the Roman people,
declare, that Rome, capital of the world, and base of the Christian
church; and that every City, State, and People of Italy, are henceforth
free. By that freedom, and in the same consecrated authority, we
proclaim, that the election, jurisdiction, and monarchy of the Roman
empire appertain to Rome and Rome's people, and the whole of Italy. We
cite, then, and summon personally, the illustrious princes, Louis Duke
of Bavaria, and Charles king of Bohemia, who would style themselves
Emperors of Italy, to appear before us, or the other magistrates of
Rome, to plead and to prove their claim between this day and the Day of
Pentecost. We cite also, and within the same term, the Duke of Saxony,
the Prince of Brandenburg, and whosoever else, potentate, prince, or
prelate, asserts the right of Elector to the imperial throne--a
right that, we find it chronicled from ancient and immemorial time,
appertaineth only to the Roman people--and this in vindication of
our civil liberties, without derogation of the spiritual power of
the Church, the Pontiff, and the Sacred College. Herald, proclaim
the citation, at the greater and more formal length, as written and
intrusted to your hands, without the Lateran."

     ("Il tutto senza derogare all' autorita della Chiesa, del
     Papa e del Sacro Collegio." So concludes this extraordinary
     citation, this bold and wonderful assertion of the classic
     independence of Italy, in the most feudal time of the
     fourteenth century. The anonymous biographer of Rienzi
     declares that the Tribune cited also the Pope and the
     Cardinals to reside in Rome. De Sade powerfully and
     incontrovertibly refutes this addition to the daring or the
     extravagance of Rienzi. Gibbon, however, who has rendered
     the rest of the citation in terms more abrupt and
     discourteous than he was warranted by any authority, copies
     the biographer's blunder, and sneers at De Sade, as using
     arguments "rather of decency than of weight." Without
     wearying the reader with all the arguments of the learned
     Abbe, it may be sufficient to give the first two.

     1st. All the other contemporaneous historians that have
     treated of this event, G. Villani, Hocsemius, the Vatican
     MSS. and other chroniclers, relating the citation of the
     Emperor and Electors, say nothing of that of the Pope and
     Cardinals; and the Pope (Clement VI.), in his subsequent
     accusations of Rienzi, while very bitter against his
     citation of the Emperor, is wholly silent on what would have
     been to the Pontiff the much greater offence of citing
     himself and the Cardinals.)

     2. The literal act of this citation, as published formally
     in the Lateran, is extant in Hocsemius, (whence is borrowed,
     though not at all its length, the speech in the text of our
     present tale;) and in this document the Pope and his
     Cardinals are not named in the summons.

     Gibbon's whole account of Rienzi is superficial and unfair.
     To the cold and sneering scepticism, which so often deforms
     the gigantic work of that great writer, allowing nothing for
     that sincere and urgent enthusiasm which, whether of liberty
     or religion, is the most common parent of daring action, the
     great Roman seems but an ambitious and fantastic madman. In
     Gibbon's hands what would Cromwell have been? what Vane?
     what Hampden? The pedant, Julian, with his dirty person and
     pompous affectation, was Gibbon's ideal of a great man.)

As Rienzi concluded this bold proclamation of the liberties of Italy,
the Tuscan ambassadors, and those of some other of the free states,
murmured low approbation. The ambassadors of those States that affected
the party of the Emperor looked at each other in silent amaze and
consternation. The Roman Barons remained with mute lips and downcast
eyes; only over the aged face of Stephen Colonna settled a smile, half
of scorn, half of exultation. But the great mass of the citizens were
caught by words that opened so grand a prospect as the emancipation of
all Italy: and their reverence of the Tribune's power and fortune was
almost that due to a supernatural being; so that they did not pause to
calculate the means which were to correspond with the boast.

While his eye roved over the crowd, the gorgeous assemblage near him,
the devoted throng beyond;--as on his ear boomed the murmur of thousands
and ten thousands, in the space without, from before the Palace of
Constantine (Palace now his own!) sworn to devote life and fortune to
his cause; in the flush of prosperity that yet had known no check; in
the zenith of power, as yet unconscious of reverse, the heart of
the Tribune swelled proudly: visions of mighty fame and limitless
dominion,--fame and dominion, once his beloved Rome's and by him to be
restored, rushed before his intoxicated gaze; and in the delirious and
passionate aspirations of the moment, he turned his sword alternately to
the three quarters of the then known globe, and said, in an abstracted
voice, as a man in a dream, "In the right of the Roman people this too
is mine!" ("Questo e mio.")

Low though the voice, the wild boast was heard by all around as
distinctly as if borne to them in thunder. And vain it were to describe
the various sensations it excited; the extravagance would have moved the
derision of his foes, the grief of his friends, but for the manner of
the speaker, which, solemn and commanding, hushed for the moment even
reason and hatred themselves in awe; afterwards remembered and repeated,
void of the spell they had borrowed from the utterer, the words met the
cold condemnation of the well-judging; but at that moment all
things seemed possible to the hero of the people. He spoke as one
inspired--they trembled and believed; and, as rapt from the spectacle,
he stood a moment silent, his arm still extended--his dark dilating
eye fixed upon space--his lip parted--his proud head towering and erect
above the herd,--his own enthusiasm kindled that of the more humble and
distant spectators; and there was a deep murmur begun by one, echoed by
the rest, "The Lord is with Italy and Rienzi!"

The Tribune turned, he saw the Pope's Vicar astonished, bewildered,
rising to speak. His sense and foresight returned to him at once, and,
resolved to drown the dangerous disavowal of the Papal authority
for this hardihood, which was ready to burst from Raimond's lips, he
motioned quickly to the musicians, and the solemn and ringing chant of
the sacred ceremony prevented the Bishop of Orvietto all occasion of
self-exoneration or reply.

The moment the ceremony was over, Rienzi touched the Bishop, and
whispered, "We will explain this to your liking. You feast with us at
the Lateran.--Your arm." Nor did he leave the good Bishop's arm, nor
trust him to other companionship, until to the stormy sound of horn
and trumpet, drum and cymbal, and amidst such a concourse as might have
hailed, on the same spot, the legendary baptism of Constantine, the
Tribune and his nobles entered the great gates of the Lateran, then the
Palace of the World.

Thus ended that remarkable ceremony and that proud challenge of the
Northern Powers, in behalf of the Italian liberties, which, had it been
afterwards successful, would have been deemed a sublime daring; which,
unsuccessful, has been construed by the vulgar into a frantic insolence;
but which, calmly considering all the circumstances that urged on
the Tribune, and all the power that surrounded him, was not, perhaps,
altogether so imprudent as it seemed. And, even accepting that
imprudence in the extremest sense,--by the more penetrating judge of
the higher order of character, it will probably be considered as the
magnificent folly of a bold nature, excited at once by position and
prosperity, by religious credulities, by patriotic aspirings, by
scholastic visions too suddenly transferred from revery to action,
beyond that wise and earthward policy which sharpens the weapon ere it
casts the gauntlet.



Chapter 4.VII. The Festival.

The Festival of that day was far the most sumptuous hitherto known. The
hint of Cecco del Vecchio, which so well depicted the character of his
fellow-citizens, as yet it exists, though not to such excess, in their
love of holyday pomp and gorgeous show, was not lost upon Rienzi. One
instance of the universal banqueting (intended, indeed, rather for
the people than the higher ranks) may illustrate the more than royal
profusion that prevailed. From morn till eve, streams of wine flowed
like a fountain from the nostrils of the Horse of the great Equestrian
Statue of Constantine. The mighty halls of the Lateran palace, open
to all ranks, were prodigally spread; and the games, sports, and
buffooneries of the time, were in ample requisition. Apart, the
Tribunessa, as Nina was rather unclassically entitled, entertained
the dames of Rome; while the Tribune had so effectually silenced or
conciliated Raimond, that the good Bishop shared his peculiar table--the
only one admitted to that honour. As the eye ranged each saloon
and hall--it beheld the space lined with all the nobility and
knighthood--the wealth and strength--the learning and the beauty--of the
Italian metropolis; mingled with ambassadors and noble strangers, even
from beyond the Alps; (The simple and credulous briographer of
Rienzi declares his fame to have reached the ears of the Soldan of
Babylon.)--envoys not only of the free states that had welcomed the rise
of the Tribune, but of the highborn and haughty tyrants who had first
derided his arrogance, and now cringed to his power. There, were not
only the ambassadors of Florence, of Sienna, of Arezzo (which last
subjected its government to the Tribune,) of Todi, of Spoleto, and of
countless other lesser towns and states, but of the dark and terrible
Visconti, prince of Milan; of Obizzo of Ferrara, and the tyrant rulers
of Verona and Bologna; even the proud and sagacious Malatesta, lord of
Rimini, whose arm afterwards broke for awhile the power of Montreal,
at the head of his Great Company, had deputed his representative in his
most honoured noble. John di Vico, the worst and most malignant despot
of his day, who had sternly defied the arms of the Tribune, now subdued
and humbled, was there in person; and the ambassadors of Hungary and of
Naples mingled with those of Bavaria and Bohemia, whose sovereigns that
day had been cited to the Roman Judgment Court. The nodding of plumes,
the glitter of jewels and cloth of gold, the rustling of silks and
jingle of golden spurs, the waving of banners from the roof, the sounds
of minstrelsy from the galleries above, all presented a picture of such
power and state--a court and chivalry of such show--as the greatest of
the feudal kings might have beheld with a sparkling eye and a swelling
heart. But at that moment the cause and lord of all that splendour,
recovered from his late exhilaration, sat moody and abstracted,
remembering with a thoughtful brow the adventure of the past night,
and sensible that amongst his gaudiest revellers lurked his intended
murtherers. Amidst the swell of the minstrelsy and the pomp of the
crowd, he felt that treason scowled beside him; and the image of the
skeleton obtruding, as of old, its grim thought of death upon the feast,
darkened the ruby of the wine, and chilled the glitter of the scene.

It was while the feast was loudest that Rienzi's page was seen gliding
through the banquet, and whispering several of the nobles; each bowed
low, but changed colour as he received the message.

"My Lord Savelli," said Orsini, himself trembling, "bear yourself more
bravely. This must be meant in honour, not revenge. I suppose your
summons corresponds with mine."

"He--he--asks--asks--me to supper at the Capitol; a fri-endly
meeting--(pest on his friendship!)--after the noise of the day."

"The words addressed also to me!" said Orsini, turning to one of the
Frangipani.

Those who received the summons soon broke from the feast, and collected
in a group, eagerly conferring. Some were for flight, but flight was
confession; their number, rank, long and consecrated impunity, reassured
them, and they resolved to obey. The old Colonna, the sole innocent
Baron of the invited guests, was also the only one who refused the
invitation. "Tush!" said he, peevishly; "here is feasting enough for one
day! Tell the Tribune that ere he sups I hope to be asleep. Grey hairs
cannot encounter all this fever of festivity."

As Rienzi rose to depart, which he did early, for the banquet took place
while yet morning, Raimond, eager to escape and confer with some of his
spiritual friends, as to the report he should make to the Pontiff, was
beginning his expressions of farewell, when the merciless Tribune said
to him gravely--

"My Lord, we want you on urgent business at the Capitol. A prisoner--a
trial--perhaps (he added with his portentous and prophetic frown) an
execution waits us! Come."

"Verily, Tribune," stammered the good Bishop, "this is a strange time
for execution!"

"Last night was a time yet more strange.--Come."

There was something in the way in which the final word was pronounced,
that Raimond could not resist. He sighed, muttered, twitched his robes,
and followed the Tribune. As he passed through the halls, the company
rose on all sides. Rienzi repaid their salutations with smiles and
whispers of frank courtesy and winning address. Young as he yet was,
and of a handsome and noble presence, that took every advantage from
splendid attire, and yet more from an appearance of intellectual command
in his brow and eye, which the less cultivated signors of that dark
age necessarily wanted--he glittered through the court as one worthy to
form, and fitted to preside over, it; and his supposed descent from the
Teuton Emperor, which, since his greatness, was universally bruited and
believed abroad, seemed undeniably visible to the foreign lords in the
majesty of his mien and the easy blandness of his address.

"My Lord Prefect," said he to a dark and sullen personage in black
velvet, the powerful and arrogant John di Vico, prefect of Rome, "we are
rejoiced to find so noble a guest at Rome: we must repay the courtesy by
surprising you in your own palace ere long;--nor will you, Signor (as he
turned to the envoy from Tivoli,) refuse us a shelter amidst your groves
and waterfalls ere the vintage be gathered. Methinks Rome, united with
sweet Tivoli, grows reconciled to the Muses. Your suit is carried,
Master Venoni: the council recognises its justice; but I reserved
the news for this holyday--you do not blame me, I trust." This was
whispered, with a half-affectionate frankness, to a worthy citizen, who,
finding himself amidst so many of the great, would have shrunk from
the notice of the Tribune; but it was the policy of Rienzi to pay an
especial and marked attention to those engaged in commercial pursuits.
As, after tarrying a moment or two with the merchant, he passed on, the
tall person of the old Colonna caught his eye--

"Signor," said he, with a profound inclination of his head, but with a
slight emphasis of tone, "you will not fail us this evening."

"Tribune--" began the Colonna.

"We receive no excuse," interrupted the Tribune, hastily, and passed on.

He halted for a few moments before a small group of men plainly attired,
who were watching him with intense interest; for they, too, were
scholars, and in Rienzi's rise they saw another evidence of that
wonderful and sudden power which intellect had begun to assume over
brute force. With these, as if abruptly mingled with congenial spirits,
the Tribune relaxed all the gravity of his brow. Happier, perhaps, his
living career--more unequivocal his posthumous renown--had his objects
as his tastes been theirs!

"Ah, carissime!" said he to one, whose arm he drew within his own,--"and
how proceeds thy interpretation of the old marbles?--half unravelled? I
rejoice to hear it! Confer with me as of old, I pray thee. Tomorrow--no,
nor the day after, but next week--we will have a tranquil evening. Dear
poet, your ode transported me to the days of Horace; yet, methinks, we
do wrong to reject the vernacular for the Latin. You shake your head?
Well, Petrarch thinks with you: his great epic moves with the stride
of a giant--so I hear from his friend and envoy,--and here he is. My
Laeluis, is that not your name with Petrarch? How shall I express my
delight at his comforting, his inspiring letter? Alas! he overrates not
my intentions, but my power. Of this hereafter."

A slight shade darkened the Tribune's brow at these words: but moving
on, a long line of nobles and princes on either side, he regained his
self-possession, and the dignity he had dropped with his former equals.
Thus he passed through the crowd, and gradually disappeared.

"He bears him bravely," said one, as the revellers reseated themselves.
"Noticed you the 'we'--the style royal?"

"But it must be owned that he lords it well," said the ambassador of the
Visconti: "less pride would be cringing to his haughty court."

"Why," said a professor of Bologna, "why is the Tribune called proud? I
see no pride in him."

"Nor I," said a wealthy jeweller.

While these, and yet more contradictory, comments followed the exit of
the Tribune, he passed into the saloon, where Nina presided; and here
his fair person and silver tongue ("Suavis colorataeque sententiae,"
according to the description of Petrarch) won him a more general favour
with the matrons than he experienced with their lords, and not a little
contrasted the formal and nervous compliments of the good Bishop, who
served him on such occasions with an excellent foil.

But as soon as these ceremonies were done, and Rienzi mounted his horse,
his manner changed at once into a stern and ominous severity.

"Vicar," said he, abruptly, to the Bishop, "we might well need your
presence. Learn that at the Capitol now sits the Council in judgment
upon an assassin. Last night, but for Heaven's mercy, I should have
fallen a victim to a hireling's dagger, Knew you aught of this?"

And he turned so sharply on the Bishop, that the poor canonist nearly
dropped from his horse in surprise and terror.

"I,--" said he.

Rienzi smiled--"No, good my Lord Bishop! I see you are of no murtherer's
mould. But to continue:--that I might not appear to act in mine own
cause, I ordered the prisoner to be tried in my absence. In his trial
(you marked the letter brought me at our banquet?)--"

"Ay, and you changed colour."

"Well I might: in his trial, I say, he has confessed that nine of
the loftiest lords of Rome were his instigators. They sup with me
tonight!--Vicar, forwards!"

Chapter 5.I. The Judgment of the Tribune.

The brief words of the Tribune to Stephen Colonna, though they sharpened
the rage of the proud old noble, were such as he did not on reflection
deem it prudent to disobey. Accordingly, at the appointed hour, he found
himself in one of the halls of the Capitol, with a gallant party of his
peers. Rienzi received them with more than his usual graciousness.

They sate down to the splendid board in secret uneasiness and alarm,
as they saw that, with the exception of Stephen Colonna, none, save the
conspirators, had been invited to the banquet. Rienzi, regardless
of their silence and abstraction, was more than usually gay--the old
Colonna more than usually sullen.

"We fear we have but ill pleased you, my Lord Colonna, by our summons.
Once, methinks, we might more easily provoke you to a smile."

"Situations are changed, Tribune, since you were my guest."

"Why, scarcely so. I have risen, but you have not fallen. Ye walk the
streets day and night in security and peace; your lives are safe from
the robber, and your palaces no longer need bars and battlements to
shield you from your fellow-citizens. I have risen, but we all have
risen--from barbarous disorder into civilized life! My Lord Gianni
Colonna, whom we have made Captain over Campagna, you will not refuse a
cup to the Buono Stato;--nor think we mistrust your valour, when we say,
that we rejoice Rome hath no enemies to attest your generalship."

"Methinks," quoth the old Colonna, bluntly, "we shall have enemies
enough from Bohemia and Bavaria, ere the next harvest be green."

"And, if so," replied the Tribune, calmly, "foreign foes are better than
civil strife."

"Ay, if we have money in the treasury; which is but little likely, if we
have many more such holydays."

"You are ungracious, my Lord," said the Tribune; "and, besides, you are
more uncomplimentary to Rome than to ourselves. What citizen would not
part with gold to buy fame and liberty?"

"I know very few in Rome that would," answered the Baron. "But tell
me, Tribune, you who are a notable casuist, which is the best for a
state--that its governor should be over-thrifty or over-lavish?"

"I refer the question to my friend, Luca di Savelli," replied Rienzi.
"He is a grand philosopher, and I wot well could explain a much knottier
riddle, which we will presently submit to his acumen."

The Barons, who had been much embarrassed by the bold speech of the
old Colonna, all turned their eyes to Savelli, who answered with more
composure than was anticipated.

"The question admits a double reply. He who is born a ruler, and
maintains a foreign army, governing by fear, should be penurious. He who
is made ruler, who courts the people, and would reign by love, must win
their affection by generosity, and dazzle their fancies by pomp. Such, I
believe, is the usual maxim in Italy, which is rife in all experience of
state wisdom."

The Barons unanimously applauded the discreet reply of Savelli,
excepting only the old Colonna.

"Yet pardon me, Tribune," said Stephen, "if I depart from the
courtier-like decision of our friend, and opine, though with all due
respect, that even a friar's coarse serge, ('Vestimenta da Bizoco,'
was the phrase used by Colonna; a phrase borrowed from certain heretics
(bizocchi) who affected extreme austerity; afterwards the word passed
into a proverb.--See the comments of Zerfirino Re, in 'Vita di Cola di
Rienzi'.) the parade of humility, would better become thee, than this
gaudy pomp, the parade of pride!" So saying, he touched the large loose
sleeve fringed with gold, of the Tribune's purple robe.

"Hush, father!" said Gianni, Colonna's son, colouring at the unprovoked
rudeness and dangerous candour of the veteran.

"Nay, it matters not," said the Tribune, with affected indifference,
though his lip quivered, and his eye shot fire; and then, after a pause,
he resumed with an awful smile--"If the Colonna love the serge of the
friar, he may see enough of it ere we part. And now, my Lord Savelli,
for my question, which I pray you listen to; it demands all your wit.
Is it best for a State's Ruler to be over-forgiving, or over-just? Take
breath to answer: you look faint--you grow pale--you tremble--you cover
your face! Traitor and assassin, your conscience betrays you! My Lords,
relieve your accomplice, and take up the answer."

"Nay, if we are discovered," said the Orsini, rising in despair, "we
will not fall unavenged--die, tyrant!"

He rushed to the place where Rienzi stood--for the Tribune also
rose,--and made a thrust at his breast with his dagger; the steel
pierced the purple robe, yet glanced harmlessly away--and the Tribune
regarded the disappointed murtherer with a scornful smile.

"Till yesternight, I never dreamt that under the robe of state I should
need the secret corselet," said he. "My Lords, you have taught me a dark
lesson, and I thank ye."

So saying, he clapped his hands, and suddenly the folding doors at the
end of the hall flew open, and discovered the saloon of the Council
hung with silk of a blood-red, relieved by rays of white,--the emblem of
crime and death. At a long table sate the councillors in their robes; at
the bar stood a ruffian form, which the banqueters too well recognised.

"Bid Rodolf of Saxony approach!" said the Tribune.

And led by two guards, the robber entered the hall.

"Wretch, you then betrayed us!" said one of the Frangipani.

"Rodolph of Saxony goes ever to the highest bidder," returned the
miscreant, with a horrid grin. "You gave me gold, and I would have slain
your foe; your foe defeated me; he gives me life, and life is a greater
boon than gold!"

"Ye confess your crime, my Lords! Silent! dumb! Where is your wit,
Savelli? Where your pride, Rinaldo di Orsini? Gianni Colonna, is your
chivalry come to this?"

"Oh!" continued Rienzi, with deep and passionate bitterness; "oh, my
Lords, will nothing conciliate you--not to me, but to Rome? What hath
been my sin against you and yours? Disbanded ruffians (such as your
accuser)--dismantled fortresses--impartial law--what man, in all the
wild revolutions of Italy, sprung from the people, ever yielded less to
their licence? Not a coin of your coffers touched by wanton power,--not
a hair of your heads harmed by private revenge. You, Gianni Colonna,
loaded with honours, intrusted with command--you, Alphonso di
Frangipani, endowed with new principalities,--did the Tribune remember
one insult he received from you as the Plebeian? You accuse
my pride;--was it my fault that ye cringed and fawned upon my
power,--flattery on your lips, poison at your hearts? No, I have not
offended you; let the world know, that in me you aimed at liberty,
justice, law, order, the restored grandeur, the renovated rights of
Rome! At these, the Abstract and the Immortal--not at this frail form,
ye struck;--by the divinity of these ye are defeated;--for the outraged
majesty of these,--criminals and victims,--ye must die!"

With these words, uttered with the tone and air that would have become
the loftiest spirit of the ancient city, Rienzi, with a majestic step,
swept from the chamber into the Hall of Council. (The guilt of the
Barons in their designed assassination of Rienzi, though hastily
slurred over by Gibbon, and other modern writers, is clearly attested
by Muratori, the Bolognese Chronicle &c.--They even confessed the crime.
(See Cron. Estens: Muratori, tom. xviii. page 442.))

All that night the conspirators remained within that room, the doors
locked and guarded; the banquet unremoved, and its splendour strangely
contrasting the mood of the guests.

The utter prostration and despair of these dastard criminals--so unlike
the knightly nobles of France and England, has been painted by the
historian in odious and withering colours. The old Colonna alone
sustained his impetuous and imperious character. He strode to and fro
the room like a lion in his cage, uttering loud threats of resentment
and defiance; and beating at the door with his clenched hands, demanding
egress, and proclaiming the vengeance of the Pontiff.

The dawn came, slow and grey upon that agonized assembly: and just as
the last star faded from the melancholy horizon, and by the wan and
comfortless heaven, they regarded each other's faces, almost spectral
with anxiety and fear, the great bell of the Capitol sounded the notes
in which they well recognised the chime of death! It was then that the
door opened, and a drear and gloomy procession of cordeliers, one to
each Baron, entered the apartment! At that spectacle, we are told, the
terror of the conspirators was so great, that it froze up the very power
of speech. ("Diventarono si gelati, che non poteno favellare.") The
greater part at length, deeming all hope over, resigned themselves
to their ghostly confessors. But when the friar appointed to Stephen
approached that passionate old man, he waved his hand impatiently, and
said--"Tease me not! Tease me not!"

"Nay, son, prepare for the awful hour."

"Son, indeed!" quoth the Baron. "I am old enough to be thy grandsire;
and for the rest, tell him who sent thee, that I neither am prepared
for death, nor will prepare! I have made up my mind to live these twenty
years, and longer too;--if I catch not my death with the cold of this
accursed night."

Just at that moment a cry that almost seemed to rend the Capitol asunder
was heard, as, with one voice, the multitude below yelled forth--

"Death to the conspirators!--death! death!"

While this the scene in that hall, the Tribune issued from his chamber,
in which he had been closeted with his wife and sister. The noble spirit
of the one, the tears and grief of the other (who saw at one fell stroke
perish the house of her betrothed,) had not worked without effect upon
a temper, stern and just indeed, but naturally averse from blood; and a
heart capable of the loftiest species of revenge.

He entered the Council, still sitting, with a calm brow, and even a
cheerful eye.

"Pandulfo di Guido," he said, turning to that citizen, "you are right;
you spoke as a wise man and a patriot, when you said that to cut off
with one blow, however merited, the noblest heads of Rome would endanger
the State, sully our purple with an indelible stain, and unite the
nobility of Italy against us."

"Such, Tribune, was my argument, though the Council have decided
otherwise."

"Hearken to the shouts of the populace, you cannot appease their honest
warmth," said the demagogue Baroncelli.

Many of the Council murmured applause.

"Friends," said the Tribune, with a solemn and earnest aspect, "let
not Posterity say that Liberty loves blood; let us for once adopt
the example and imitate the mercy of our great Redeemer! We have
triumphed--let us forbear; we are saved--let us forgive!"

The speech of the Tribune was supported by Pandulfo, and others of the
more mild and moderate policy; and for a short but animated discussion,
the influence of Rienzi prevailed, and the sentence of death was
revoked, but by a small majority.

"And now," said Rienzi, "let us be more than just; let us be generous.
Speak--and boldly. Do any of ye think that I have been over-hard,
over-haughty with these stubborn spirits?--I read your answer in your
brows!--I have! Do any of ye think this error of mind may have stirred
them to their dark revenge? Do any of you deem that they partake, as we
do, of human nature,--that they are sensible to kindness, that they are
softened by generosity,--that they can be tamed and disarmed by such
vengeance as is dictated to noble foes by Christian laws?"

"I think," said Pandulfo, after a pause, "that it will not be in human
nature, if the men you pardon, thus offending and thus convicted, again
attempt your life!"

"Methinks," said Rienzi, "we must do even more than pardon. The first
great Caesar, when he did not crush a foe, strove to convert him to a
friend--"

"And perished by the attempt," said Baroncelli, abruptly.

Rienzi started and changed colour.

"If you would save these wretched prisoners, better not wait till the
fury of the mob become ungovernable," whispered Pandulfo.

The Tribune roused himself from his revery.

"Pandulfo," said he, in the same tone, "my heart misgives me--the brood
