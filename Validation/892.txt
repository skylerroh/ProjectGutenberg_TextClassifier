discovered that Inez and I are fond of each other; and in the next
place, if we do marry I shall have to get her safely out of the
kingdom, or else she will have to pass the rest of her life in a
convent, and I the rest of mine in a prison or in the galleys; that
is if I am not killed as soon as caught, which is by far the most
likely result. Obnoxious sons in law do not live long in Spain. So
you see, Geoffrey, the prospect is a bad one altogether; and if it
were not that I dearly love Inez, and that I am sure she will be
unhappy with Philip of Sottomayor, I would give the whole thing
up, and make love to the daughter of some comfortable citizen who
would give me a corner of his house and a seat at his table for
the rest of my days."

"But, seriously--" Geoffrey began.

"Well, seriously, Geoffrey, my intention is to run away with Inez
if it can be managed; but how it is to be managed at present I have
not the faintest idea. To begin with, the daughter of a Spanish
grandee is always kept in a very strong cage closely guarded, and
it needs a very large golden key to open it. Now, as you are aware,
gold is a very scarce commodity with me. Then, after getting her
out, a lavish expenditure would be needed for our flight. We should
have to make our way to the sea coast, to do all sorts of things
to throw dust into the eyes of our pursuers, and to get a passage
to some place beyond the domains of Philip, which means either to
France, England, or the Netherlands. Beyond all this will be the
question of future subsistence until, if ever, the marquis makes up
his mind to forgive his daughter and take her to his heart again,
a contingency, in my opinion, likely to be extremely remote."

"And what does the Lady Inez say to it all?" Geoffrey asked.

"The Lady Inez has had small opportunity of saying anything on the
subject, Geoffrey. Here in Spain there are mighty few opportunities
for courtship. With us at home these matters are easy enough, and
there is no lack of opportunity for pleading your suit and winning
a girl's heart if it is to be won; but here in Spain matters are
altogether different, and an unmarried girl is looked after as
sharply as if she was certain to get into some mischief or other
the instant she had an opportunity. She is never suffered to be
for a moment alone with a man; out of doors or in she has always a
duenna by her side; and as to a private chat, the thing is simply
impossible."

"Then how do you manage to make love?" Geoffrey asked.

"Well, a very little goes a long way in Spain. The manner of a bow,
the wave of a fan, the dropping of a glove or flower, the touch
of a hand in a crowded room--each of these things go as far as
a month's open love making in Ireland."

"Then how did you manage with the duenna so as to be able to speak
to her in the gardens?"

"Well, in the first place, I made myself very attentive to the
duenna; in the second place, the old lady is devout, and you know
Ireland is the land of saints, and I presented her with an amulet
containing a paring of the nail of St. Patrick."

Geoffrey burst into a laugh, in which the Irishman joined.

"Well, if it was not really St. Patrick's," the latter went on,
"it came from Ireland anyhow, which is the next best thing. Then
in the third place, the old lady is very fond of Inez; and although
she is as strict as a dragon, Inez coaxed her into the belief that
there could not be any harm in our exchanging a few words when she
was close by all the time to hear what was said. Now, I think you
know as much as I do about the matter, Geoffrey. You will understand
that a few notes have been exchanged, and that Inez loves me.
Beyond that everything is vague and uncertain, and I have not the
slightest idea what will come of it."

Some weeks passed and nothing was done. The meetings between Gerald
Burke and Inez in the Gardens of the Retiro had ceased a day or two
afterwards, the duenna having positively refused to allow them to
continue, threatening Inez to inform her father of them unless she
gave them up.

Gerald Burke's funds dwindled rapidly, although he and Geoffrey
lived in the very closest way.

"What in the world is to be done, Geoffrey? I have only got twenty
dollars left, which at the outside will pay for our lodgings and
food for another month. For the life of me I cannot see what is to
be done when that is gone, unless we take to the road."

Geoffrey shook his head. "As far as I am concerned," he said, "as
we are at war with Spain, it would be fair if I met a Spanish ship
at sea to capture and plunder it, but I am afraid the laws of war
do not justify private plunder. I should be perfectly ready to go
out and take service in a vineyard, or to earn my living in any
way if it could be managed."

"I would rob a cardinal if I had the chance," Gerald Burke said,
"and if I ever got rich would restore his money four fold and
so obtain absolution; only, unfortunately, I do not see my way to
robbing a cardinal. As to digging in the fields, Geoffrey, I would
rather hang myself at once. I am constitutionally averse to labour,
and if one once took to that sort of thing there would be an end
to everything."

"It is still open to you," Geoffrey said, "to get your friends to
obtain a commission for you."

"I could do that," Gerald said moodily, "but of all things that is
what I should most hate."

"You might make your peace with the English government and get some
of your estates back again."

"That I will not do to feed myself," Gerald Burke said firmly. "I
have thought that if I ever carry off Inez I might for her sake do
so, for I own that now all hope of help from Spain is at an end,
our cause in Ireland is lost, and it is no use going on struggling
against the inevitable; but I am not going to sue the English
government as a beggar for myself. No doubt I could borrow small
sums from Irishmen and Scotchmen here, and hold on for a few months;
but most of them are well nigh as poor as I am myself, and I would
not ask them. Besides, there would be no chance of my repaying them;
and, if I am to rob anyone, I would rather plunder these rich dons
than my own countrymen."

"Of one thing I am resolved," Geoffrey said, "I will not live at
your expense any longer, Gerald. I can speak Spanish very fairly
now, and can either take service in some Spanish family or, as I
said, get work in the field."

Gerald laughed. "My dear Geoffrey, the extra expenses caused by
you last week were, as far as I can calculate, one penny for bread
and as much for fruit; the rest of your living was obtained at the
expense of my friends."

"At any rate," Geoffrey said smiling, "I insist that my money be
now thrown into the common fund. I have offered it several times
before, but you always said we had best keep it for emergency. I
think the emergency has come now, and these ten English pounds in
my belt will enable us to take some step or other. The question is,
what step? They might last us, living as we do, for some three or
four months, but at the end of that time we should be absolutely
penniless; therefore now is the time, while we have still a small
stock in hand, to decide upon something."

"But what are we to decide upon?" Gerald Burke asked helplessly.

"I have been thinking it over a great deal," Geoffrey said, "and
my idea is that we had best go to Cadiz or some other large port.
Although Spain is at war both with England and the Netherlands,
trade still goes on in private ships, and both Dutch and English
vessels carry on commerce with Spain; therefore it seems to me
that there must be merchants in Cadiz who would be ready to give
employment to men capable of speaking and writing both in Spanish
and English, and in my case to a certain extent in Dutch. From
there, too, there might be a chance of getting a passage to England
or Holland. If we found that impossible owing to the vessels being
too carefully searched before sailing, we might at the worst take
passage as sailors on board a Spanish ship bound for the Indies,
and take our chance of escape or capture there or on the voyage.
That, at least, is what I planned for myself."

"I think your idea is a good one, Geoffrey. At any rate to Cadiz we
will go. I don't know about the mercantile business or going as a
sailor, but I could get a commission from the governor there as well
as here in Madrid; but at any rate I will go. Donna Inez was taken
last week by her father to some estates he has somewhere between
Seville and Cadiz, in order, I suppose, that he may be nearer Don
Philip, who is, I hear, at last recovering from his long illness.
I do not know that there is the slightest use in seeing her again,
but I will do so if it be possible; and if by a miracle I could
succeed in carrying her off, Cadiz would be a more likely place to
escape from than anywhere.

"Yes, I know. You think the idea is a mad one, but you have never
been in love yet. When you are you will know that lovers do not
believe in the word 'impossible.' At any rate, I mean to give Inez
the chance of determining her own fate. If she is ready to risk
everything rather than marry Don Philip, I am ready to share the
risk whatever it may be."

Accordingly on the following day Gerald Burke disposed of the
greater part of his wardrobe and belongings, purchased two ponies
for a few crowns, and he and Geoffrey, with a solitary suit of
clothes in a wallet fastened behind the saddle, started for their
journey to Cadiz. They mounted outside the city, for Gerald shrank
from meeting any acquaintances upon such a sorry steed as he had
purchased; but once on their way his spirits rose. He laughed and
chatted gaily, and spoke of the future as if all difficulties were
cleared away. The ponies, although rough animals, were strong and
sturdy, and carried their riders at a good pace. Sometimes they
travelled alone, sometimes jogged along with parties whom they
overtook by the way, or who had slept in the same posadas or inns
at which they had put up for the night.

Most of these inns were very rough, and, to Geoffrey, astonishingly
dirty. The food consisted generally of bread and a miscellaneous
olio or stew from a great pot constantly simmering over the fire,
the flavour, whatever it might be, being entirely overpowered
by that of the oil and garlic that were the most marked of its
constituents. Beds were wholly unknown at these places, the guests
simply wrapping themselves in their cloaks and lying down on the
floor, although in a few exceptional cases bundles of rushes were
strewn about to form a common bed.

But the travelling was delightful. It was now late in the autumn,
and when they were once past the dreary district of La Mancha, and
had descended to the rich plains of Cordova, the vintage was in
full progress and the harvest everywhere being garnered in. Their
midday meal consisted of bread and fruit, costing but the smallest
coin, and eaten by the wayside in the shade of a clump of trees.
They heard many tales on their way down of the bands of robbers
who infested the road, but having taken the precaution of having
the doubloons for which they had exchanged Geoffrey's English gold
sewn up in their boots, they had no fear of encountering these gentry,
having nothing to lose save their wallets and the few dollars they
had kept out for the expenses of their journey. The few jewels that
Gerald Burke retained were sewn up in the stuffing of his saddle.

After ten days' travel they reached Seville, where they stayed a
couple of days, and where the wealth and splendour of the buildings
surprised Geoffrey, who had not visited Antwerp or any of the great
commercial centres of the Netherlands.

"It is a strange taste of the Spanish kings," he observed to Gerald
Burke, "to plant their capital at Madrid in the centre of a barren
country, when they might make such a splendid city as this their
capital. I could see no charms whatever in Madrid. The climate
was detestable, with its hot sun and bitter cold winds. Here the
temperature is delightful; the air is soft and balmy, the country
round is a garden, and there is a cathedral worthy of a capital."

"It seems a strange taste," Gerald agreed; "but I believe that
when Madrid was first planted it stood in the midst of extensive
forests, and that it was merely a hunting residence for the king."

"Then, when the forests went I would have gone too," Geoffrey said.
"Madrid has not even a river worthy of the name, and has no single
point to recommend it, as far as I can see, for the capital of a
great empire. If I were a Spaniard I should certainly take up my
residence in Seville."

Upon the following morning they again started, joining, before they
had ridden many miles, a party of three merchants travelling with
their servants to Cadiz. The merchants looked a little suspiciously
at first at the two young men upon their tough steeds; but as soon
as they discovered from their first salutations that they were
foreigners, they became more cordial, and welcomed this accession
of strength to their party, for the carrying of weapons was universal,
and the portion of the road between Seville and Cadiz particularly
unsafe, as it was traversed by so many merchants and wealthy
people. The conversation speedily turned to the disturbed state of
the roads.

"I do not think," one of the merchants said, "that any ordinary
band of robbers would dare attack us," and he looked round with
satisfaction at the six armed servants who rode behind them.

"It all depends," Gerald Burke said, with a sly wink at Geoffrey,
"upon what value the robbers may place upon the valour of your
servants. As a rule serving men are very chary of their skins, and I
should imagine that the robbers must be pretty well aware of that
fact. Most of them are disbanded soldiers or deserters, and I should
say that four of them are more than a match for your six servants.
I would wager that your men would make but a very poor show of it
if it came to fighting."

"But there are our three selves and you two gentlemen," the merchant
said in a tone of disquiet.

"Well," Gerald rejoined, "I own that from your appearance I should
not think, worshipful sir, that fighting was altogether in your line.
Now, my servant, young as he is, has taken part in much fighting
in the Netherlands, and I myself have had some experience with
my sword; but if we were attacked by robbers we should naturally
stand neutral. Having nothing to defend, and having no inclination
whatever to get our throats cut in protecting the property of others,
I think that you will see for yourselves that that is reasonable.
We are soldiers of fortune, ready to venture our lives in a good
service, and for good pay, but mightily disinclined to throw them
away for the mere love of fighting."



CHAPTER XII

RECRUITING THEIR FUNDS


As soon as Gerald Burke began conversing with the merchants,
Geoffrey fell back and took his place among their servants, with
whom he at once entered into conversation. To amuse himself he
continued in the same strain that he had heard Gerald adopt towards
the merchants, and spoke in terms of apprehension of the dangers
of the journey, and of the rough treatment that had befallen those
who had ventured to offer opposition to the robbers. He was not
long in discovering, by the anxious glances they cast round them,
and by the manner of their questions, that some at least of the
party were not to be relied upon in case of an encounter.

He was rather surprised at Gerald remaining so long in company with
the merchants, for their pace was a slow one, as they were followed
by eight heavily laden mules, driven by two muleteers, and it would
have been much pleasanter, he thought, to have trotted on at their
usual pace. About midday, as they were passing along the edge of
a thick wood, a party of men suddenly sprang out and ordered them
to halt. Geoffrey shouted to the men with him to come on, and
drawing his sword dashed forward.

Two of the men only followed him. The others hesitated, until
a shot from a musket knocked off one of their hats, whereupon the
man and his comrades turned their horses' heads and rode off at
full speed. The merchants had drawn their swords, and stood on the
defensive, and Geoffrey on reaching them was surprised to find that
Gerald Burke was sitting quietly on his horse without any apparent
intention of taking part in the fight.

"Put up your sword, Geoffrey," he said calmly; "this affair is no
business of ours. We have nothing to lose, and it is no business
of ours to defend the money bags of these gentlemen."

The robbers, eight in number, now rushed up. One of the merchants,
glancing round, saw that two of their men only had come up to
their assistance. The muleteers, who were probably in league with
the robbers, had fled, leaving their animals standing in the road.
The prospect seemed desperate. One of the merchants was an elderly
man, the others were well on middle age. The mules were laden with
valuable goods, and they had with them a considerable sum of money
for making purchases at Cadiz. It was no time for hesitation.

"We will give you five hundred crowns if you will both aid us to
beat off these robbers."

"It is a bargain," Gerald replied. "Now, Geoffrey, have at these
fellows!"

Leaping from their ponies they ranged themselves by the merchants
just as the robbers attacked them. Had it not been for their aid
the combat would have been a short one; for although determined to
defend their property to the last, the traders had neither strength
nor skill at arms. One was unhorsed at the first blow, and another
wounded; but the two servants, who had also dismounted, fought
sturdily, and Gerald and Geoffrey each disposed of a man before
the robbers, who had not reckoned upon their interference, were
prepared to resist their attack.

The fight did not last many minutes. The traders did their best,
and although by no means formidable opponents, distracted the
attention of the robbers, who were startled by the fall of two of
their party. Geoffrey received a sharp cut on the head, but at the
same moment ran his opponent through the body, while Gerald Burke
cut down the man opposed to him. The other four robbers, seeing
they were now outnumbered, at once took to their heels.

"By St. Jago!" one of the traders said, "you are stout fighters,
young men, and have won your fee well. Methought we should have
lost our lives as well as our goods, and I doubt not we should have
done so had you not ranged yourselves with us. Now, let us bandage
up our wounds, for we have all received more or less hurt."

When the wounds, some of which were serious, were attended to, the
fallen robbers were examined. Three of them were dead; but the man
last cut down by Gerald Burke seemed likely to recover.

"Shall we hang him upon a tree as a warning to these knaves, or
shall we take him with us to the next town and give him in charge
of the authorities there?" one of the traders asked.

"If I were you I would do neither," Gerald said, "but would let him
go free if he will tell you the truth about this attack. It will
be just as well for you to get to the bottom of this affair, and
find out whether it is a chance meeting, or whether any of your
own people have been in league with him."

"That is a good idea," the trader agreed, "and I will carry it
out," and going up to the man, who had now recovered his senses,
he said to him sternly: "We have made up our minds to hang you;
but you may save your life if you will tell us how you came to set
upon us. Speak the truth and you shall go free, otherwise we will
finish with you without delay."

The robber, seeing an unexpected chance of escape from punishment, at
once said that the captain of their band, who was the man Geoffrey
had last run through, came out from Seville the evening before, and
told him that one Juan Campos, with whom he had long had intimate
relations, and who was clerk to a rich trader, had, upon promise that
he should receive one fifth of the booty taken, informed him that
his master with two other merchants was starting on the following
morning for Cadiz with a very valuable lot of goods, and twenty-five
thousand crowns, which they intended to lay out in the purchase of
goods brought by some galleons that had just arrived from the Indies.
He had arranged to bribe his master's two servants to ride away
when they attacked the gang, and also to settle with the muleteers
so that they should take no part in the affair. They had reckoned
that the flight of two of the servants would probably affect the
others, and had therefore expected the rich booty to fall into
their hands without the trouble of striking a blow for it.

"It is well we followed your suggestion," one of the traders said
to Gerald. "I had no suspicion of the honesty of my clerk, and
had we not made this discovery he would doubtless have played me a
similar trick upon some other occasion. I will ride back at once,
friends, for if he hears of the failure of the attack he may take
the alarm and make off with all he can lay his hands upon. Our
venture was to be in common. I will leave it to you to carry it
out, and return and dismiss Campos and the two rascally servants."
The three traders went apart and consulted together. Presently the
eldest of the party returned to the young men.

"We have another five days' journey before us," he said, "and but
two servants upon whom we can place any reliance. We have evidence
of the unsafety of the roads, and, as you have heard, we have a
large sum of money with us. You have already more than earned the
reward I offered you, and my friends have agreed with me that if
you will continue to journey with us as far as Cadiz, and to give
us the aid of your valour should we be again attacked, we will make
the five hundred crowns a thousand. It is a large sum, but we have
well nigh all our fortunes at stake, and we feel that we owe you
our lives as well as the saving of our money."

"We could desire nothing better," Gerald replied, "and will answer
with our lives that your goods and money shall arrive safely at
Cadiz."

The traders then called up their two serving men, and told them
that on their arrival at Cadiz they would present them each with a
hundred crowns for having so stoutly done their duty. The employer
of the treacherous clerk then turned his horse's head and rode back
towards Seville, while the others prepared to proceed on their way.
The two muleteers had now come out from among the bushes, and were
busy refastening the bales on the mules, the ropes having become
loosened in the struggles of the animals while the fight was going
on. The merchants had decided to say nothing to the men as to the
discovery that they were in league with the robbers.

"Half these fellows are in alliance with these bands, which are a
