trouble; for this humane commander refused my request, and ordered me
to continue in the place allotted for the surgeon's mates, or else be
contented to be in the hospital, which, by the by, was three degrees
more offensive and more suffocating than our own berth below. Another,
in my condition, perhaps, would have submitted to his fate, and died
in a pet; but I could not brook the thought of perishing so pitifully,
after I had weathered so many gales of hard fortune: I therefore,
without minding Oakum's injunction, prevailed upon the soldiers (whose
good-will I had acquired) to admit my hammock among them; and actually
congratulated myself upon my comfortable situation; which Crampley no
sooner understood, than he signified to the captain my contempt of his
orders, and was invested with power to turn me down again into my proper
habitation.

This barbarous piece of revenge incensed me so much against the author,
that I vowed, with bitter imprecations, to call him to a severe account,
if ever it should be in my power; and the agitation of my spirits
increased my fever to a violent degree. While I lay gasping for breath
in this infernal abode, I was visited by a sergeant, the bones of whose
nose I had reduced and set to rights, after they had been demolished
by a splinter during our last engagement; he, being informed of my
condition, offered me the use of his berth in the middle deck, which was
enclosed with canvas, and well aired by a port-hole that remained
open within it. I embraced this proposal with joy, and was immediately
conducted to the place, where I was treated, while my illness lasted,
with the utmost tenderness and care by this grateful halberdier, who had
no other bed for himself than a hencoop during the whole passage. Here
I lay and enjoyed the breeze, notwithstanding which my malady gained
ground, and at length my life was despaired of, though I never lost
hopes of recovery, even when I had the mortification to see, from my
cabin-window, six or seven thrown overboard every day, who died of the
same distemper. This confidence, I am persuaded, conduced a great
deal to the preservation of my life, especially when joined to another
resolution I took at the beginning, namely, to refuse all medicine,
which I could not help thinking co-operated with the disease, and,
instead of resisting putrefaction, promoted a total degeneracy of the
vital fluid. When my friend Morgan, therefore, brought his diaphoretic
bolases, I put them into my mouth, 'tis true, but without any intention
of swallowing them: and, when he went away, spit them out, and washed
my mouth with water-gruel. I seemingly complied in this matter, that I
might not affront the blood of Caractacus, by a refusal which might
have intimated a diffidence of his physical capacity, for he acted as
my physician; Doctor Mackshane never once inquiring about me, or even
knowing where I was. When my distemper was at the height, Morgan thought
my case desperate, and, after having applied a blister to the nape of my
neck, squeezed my hand, bidding me, with a woful countenance, recommend
myself to Cot and my Reteemer; then, taking his leave, desired the
chaplain to come and administer some spiritual consolation to me;
but, before he arrived, I made shift to rid myself of the troublesome
application the Welshman had bestowed on my back. The person, having
felt my pulse, inquired into the nature of my complaints, hemmed a
little, and began thus: "Mr. Random, God out of his infinite mercy has
been pleased to visit you with a dreadful distemper, the issue of which
no man knows. You may be permitted to recover and live many days on the
face of the earth; and, which is more probable, you may be taken
away, and cut off in the flower of your youth. It is incumbent on you,
therefore, to prepare for the great change, by repenting sincerely of
your sins; of this there cannot be a greater sign, than an ingenuous
confession, which I conjure you to make without hesitation or mental
reservation; and, when I am convinced of your sincerity, I will then
give you such comfort as the situation of your soul will admit of.
Without doubt, you have been guilty of numberless transgressions
to which youth is subject, as swearing, drunkenness, whoredom, and
adultery: tell me therefore, without reserve, the particulars of each,
especially of the last, that I may be acquainted with the true state of
your conscience; for no physician will prescribe for his patient until
he knows the circumstances of his disease."

As I was not under any apprehensions of death, I could not help smiling
at the chaplain's inquisitive remonstrance, which I told him savoured
more of the Roman than of the Protestant church, in recommending
auricular confession; a thing, in my opinion, not at all necessary
to salvation, and which, for that reason, I declined. This reply
disconcerted him a little; however, he explained away his meaning, in
making learned distinctions between what was absolutely necessary
and what was only convenient; then proceeded to ask what religion I
professed. I answered, that I had not as yet considered the difference
of religions, consequently had not fixed on any one in particular, but
that I was bred a Presbyterian. At this word the chaplain expressed
great astonishment, and said, he could not comprehend how a presbyterian
was entitled to any post under the English government. Then he asked
if I had ever received the sacrament, or taken the oaths; to which
questions, I replying in the negative, he held up his hands, assured
me he could do me no service, wished I might not be in a state of
reprobation, and returned to his messmates, who were making merry in the
ward-room, round a table well stored with bumbo(2) and wine.


(2)bumbo is a liquor composed of rum, sugar, water, and nutmeg

This insinuation, terrible as it was, had not such an effect upon me as
the fever, which, soon after he had left me, grew outrageous. I began
to see strange chimeras and concluded myself upon the point of being
delirious; in the meantime, being in great danger of suffocation, I
started up in a kind of frantic fit, with an intention to plunge myself
into the sea; and, as my friend the sergeant was not present, would
certainly have cooled myself to some purpose, had I not perceived a
moisture upon my thigh, as I endeavoured to get out of my hammock: the
appearance of this revived my hopes, and I had reflection and resolution
enough to take the advantage of this favourable symptom, by tearing the
shirt from my body, and the sheets from my bed, and wrapping myself in a
thick blanket, in which inclosure, for about a quarter of an hour, felt
all the pains of hell: but it was not long before I was recompensed for
my suffering by a profuse sweat, that, bursting from the whole surface
of my skin, in less than two hours, relieved me from all my complaints
except that of weakness; and left me as hungry as a kite. I enjoyed
a very comfortable nap, after which I was regaling myself with the
agreeable reverie of future happiness, when I heard Morgan, on the
outside of the curtain, ask the sergeant if I was alive still? "Alive!"
cried the other, "God forbid he should be otherwise! he has lain quiet
these five hours, and I do not choose to disturb him, for sleep will do
him great service." "Ay," said my fellow-mate, "he sleeps so sound (look
you), that he will not waken till the great trump plows--Cot be merciful
to his soul. He has paid his debt like an honest man--ay, and moreover,
he is at rest from all persecutions, and troubles, and afflictions, of
which, Cot knows, and I know, he had his own share--Ochree! Ochree!
he was a promising youth indeed!" So saying he groaned grievously,
and began to whine in such a manner, as persuaded me he had a real
friendship for me. The sergeant, alarmed at his words, came into the
berth, and, while he looked upon me, I smiled, and tipped him the wink:
he immediately guessed my meaning and remaining silent, Morgan was
confirmed in his opinion of my being dead; whereupon he approached, with
tears in his eyes, in order to indulge his grief with a sight of
the object: and I counterfeited death so well, by fixing my eyes and
dropping my under-jaw, that he said, "There he lies, no petter than a
lump of clay, Cot help me!" and observed, by the distortion of my face,
that I must have had a strong struggle.

I should not have been able to contain myself much longer, when he began
to perform the last duty of a friend, in closing my eyes and my mouth,
upon which I suddenly snapped at his fingers and discomposed him so much
that he started back, turned pale as ashes, and stared like the picture
of horror; although I could not help laughing at his appearance, I was
concerned for his situation, and stretched out my hand, telling him I
hoped to live and eat some salmagundy of his making in England. It was
some time before he could recollect himself so far as to feel my pulse,
and inquire into the particulars of my disease; but when he found I had
enjoyed a favourable crisis, he congratulated me upon my good fortune;
not failing to ascribe it, under Cot, to the blister he had applied
to my back, at his last visit; which, by the bye, said he, must now be
removed and dressed; he was actually going to fetch dressings, when I,
feigning astonishment, said, "Bless me! sure you never applied a blister
to me--there is nothing on my back, I assure you." But he could not be
convinced till he had examined it, and then endeavoured to conceal his
confusion, by expressing his surprise in finding the skin untouched
and the plaster missing. In order to excuse myself for paying so little
regard to his prescription, I pretended to have been insensible when it
was put on, and to have pulled it off afterwards in a fit of delirium.
This apology satisfied my friend, who, on this occasion, abated a good
deal of his stiffness in regard to punctilio; and as we were now safely
arrived at Jamaica, where I had the benefit of fresh provisions and
other refreshments, I recovered strength every day, and, in a short
time, my health and vigour were perfectly re-established.

When I got up at first, and was just able to crawl about the deck with
a staff in my hand, I met Doctor Mackshane, who passed by me with a
disdainful look, and did not vouchsafe to honour me with one word. After
him came Crampley, who, strutting up to me with a fierce countenance,
pronounced, "Here's fine discipline on-board, when such lazy, skulking
sons of bitches as you are allowed, on pretence of sickness, to lollop
at your ease, while your betters are kept to hard duty!" The sight and
behaviour of this malicious scoundrel enraged me so much that I could
scarce refrain from laying my cudgel across his pate; but when I
considered my present feebleness, and the enemies I had in the ship,
who wanted only a pretence to ruin me, I restrained my passion, and
contented myself with telling him, I had not forgot his insolence
and malice, and that I hoped we should meet one day on shore. At this
declaration he grinned, shook his fist, and swore he longed for nothing
more than such an opportunity. Meanwhile our ship was ordered to be
heaved down, victualled, and watered, for her return to England; and our
captain, for some reason or other, not thinking it convenient for him
to revisit his native country at this time, exchanged with a gentleman,
who, on the other hand, wished for nothing so much as to be safe without
the tropic: all his care and tenderness of himself being insufficient to
preserve his complexion from the injuries of the sun and weather.

Our tyrant having left the ship, and carried his favourite Mackshane
along with him, to my inexpressible satisfaction, our new commander came
on board in a ten-oared barge, overshadowed with a vast umbrella, and
appeared in everything the reverse of Oakum, being a tall, thin young
man, dressed in this manner: a white hat, garnished with a red feather,
adorned his head, from whence his hair flowed upon his shoulders,
in ringlets tied behind with a ribbon. His coat, consisting of
pink-coloured silk, lined with white, by the elegance of the cut retired
backward, as it were, to discover a white satin waistcoat embroidered
with gold, unbuttoned at the upper part to display a brooch set with
garnets, that glittered in the breast of his shirt, which was of the
finest cambric, edged with right Mechlin: the knees of his crimson
velvet breeches scarce descended so low as to meet his silk stockings,
which rose without spot or wrinkle on his meagre legs, from shoes of
blue Meroquin, studded with diamond buckles that flamed forth rivals to
the sun! A steel-hilted sword, inlaid with gold, and decked with a knot
of ribbon which fell down in a rich tassel, equipped his side; and an
amber-headed cane hung dangling from his wrist. But the most remarkable
parts of his furniture were, a mask on his face, and white gloves on his
hands, which did not seem to be put on with an intention to be pulled
off occasionally, but were fixed with a curious ring on the little
finger of each hand.

In this garb, Captain Whiffle, for that was his name, took possession of
the ship, surrounded with a crowd of attendants, all of whom, in their
different degrees, seemed to be of their patron's disposition; and the
air was so impregnated with perfumes, that one may venture to affirm the
climate of Arabia Felix was not half so sweet-scented. My fellow-mate,
observing no surgeon among his train, thought he had found an occasion
too favourable for himself to be neglected; and, remembering the old
proverb, "Spare to speak, and spare to speed," resolved to solicit the
new captain's interest immediately, before any other surgeon could be
appointed for the ship. With this view he repaired to the cabin in his
ordinary dress, consisting of a check shirt and trousers, a brown linen
waistcoat, and a nightcap of the same (neither of them very clean,)
which, for his further misfortune, happened to smell strong of tobacco.
Entering without any ceremony into this sacred place, he found Captain
Whiffle reposing upon a couch, with a wrapper of fine chintz about his
body, and a muslin cap bordered with lace about his head; and after
several low congees began in this manner: "Sir, I hope you will forgive,
and excuse, and pardon, the presumption of one who has not the honour of
being known to you, but who is, nevertheless a shentleman porn and pred,
and moreover has had misfortunes, Cot help me, in the world."

Here he was interrupted by the captain, who, on seeing him, had started
up with great amazement, at the novelty of the apparition; and, having
recollected himself, pronounced with a look and tone signifying disdain,
curiosity and surprise, "Zauns! who art thou?" "I am surgeon's first
mate on board of this ship," replied Morgan: "and I most vehemently
desire and beseech you, with all submission, to be pleased to condescend
and vouchsafe to inquire into my character, and my pehaviour, and my
deserts, which, under Cot, I hope, will entitle me to the vacancy of
surgeon." As he proceeded in his speech, he continued advancing towards
the captain, whose nostrils were no sooner saluted with the aromatic
flavour that exhaled from him, than he cried with great emotion, "Heaven
preserve me! I am suffocated! Fellow, fellow, away with thee! Curse
thee, fellow! Get thee gone! I shall be stunk to death!" At the noise of
his outcries, his servants ran into his apartment, and he accosted them
thus: "Villains! cut-throats! traitors! I am betrayed! I am sacrificed!
Will you not carry that monster away? or must I be stifled with the
stench of him? oh, oh!" With these interjections he sank down upon his
settee in a fit: his valet-de-chambre plied him with a smelling-bottle,
one footman chafed his temples with Hungary water, another sprinkled the
floor with spirits of lavender, a third pushed Morgan out of the cabin;
who coming to the place where I was, sat down with a demure countenance
and, according to his custom, when he received any indignity which he
durst not revenge, began to sing a Welsh ditty.

I guessed he was under some agitation of spirits and desired to know
the cause; but, instead of answering me directly, he asked with great
emotion, if I thought him a monster and a stinkard? "A monster and a
stinkard!" said I, with some surprise: "did anybody call you so?" "Cot
is my judge," replied be, "Captain Fifle did call me both; ay, and all
the waters in the Tawy will not wash it out of my remembrance. I do
affirm and avouch, and maintain, with my soul, and my pody, and my
plood, look you, that I have no smells apout me, but such as a Christian
ought to have, except the effluvia of tobacco, which is a cephalic,
odoriferous, aromatic herb; and he is a son of a mountain goat who says
otherwise. As for my being a minister, let that be as it is: I am as Cot
was pleased to create me, which, peradventure, is more than I shall ever
aver of him who gave me that title; for I will proclaim it before the
world, that he is disguised, and transfigured, and transmogrified, with
affectation and whimseys; and that he is more like a papoon than of the
human race."






CHAPTER XXXV

Captain Whiffle sends for me--his situation described--his surgeon
arrives, prescribes for him, and puts him to bed--a bed is put up for
Mr. Simper contiguous to the state room, which, with other parts of the
captains behaviour, gives the ship's company a very unfavourable idea of
their commander--I am detained in the West Indies by the admiral, and go
on board of the Lizard sloop of war in quality of surgeon's mate, where
I make myself known to the surgeon, who treats me very kindly--I go on
shore, sell my ticket, purchase necessaries, and, at my return on board,
am surprised at the sight of Crampley, who is appointed lieutenant of
the sloop--we sail on a cruise--take a prize in which I arrive at Port
Morant under the command of my messmate, with whom I live in great
harmony

He was going on with an eulogium upon the captain, when I received a
message to clean myself, and go up to the great cabin: and with this
command I instantly complied, sweetening myself with rosewater from the
medicine chest. When I entered the room, I was ordered to stand by the
door, until Captain Whiffle had reconnoitered me at a distance with
a spy-glass. He, having consulted one sense in this manner, bade me
advance gradually, that his nose might have intelligence before it could
be much offended: I therefore approached with great caution and success,
and he was pleased to say, "Ay, this creature is tolerable." I found him
lolling on his couch with a languishing air, his head supported by his
valet-de-chambre, who from time to time applied a smelling-bottle to his
nose. "Vergette," said he in a squeaking tone, "dost think this wretch
(meaning me) will do me no injury? May I venture to submit my arm to
him?" "Pon my word," replied the valet, "I do tink dat dere be great
occasion for your honour losing a small quantite of blodt; and the young
man ave quelque chose of de bonne mine." "Well, then," said his master,
"I think I must venture." Then, addressing himself to me, "Hast thou
ever blooded anybody but brutes? But I need not ask thee, for thou wilt
tell me a most d--able lie," "Brutes, sir!" answered I, pulling down his
glove, in order to feel his pulse, "I never meddle with brutes." "What
the devil art thou about?" cried he, "dost thou intend to twist off my
hand? Gad's curse! my arm is benumbed up to the very shoulder! Heaven
have mercy upon me! must I perish under the hands of savages? What
an unfortunate dog was I to come on board without my own surgeon, Mr.
Simper." I craved pardon for having handled him so roughly, and, with
the utmost care, and tenderness, tied up his arm with a fillet of silk.
While I was feeling for the vein, he desired to know how much blood
I intended to take from him, and, when I answered, "not above twelve
ounces," started up with a look full of horror, and bade me be gone,
swearing I had a design upon his life. Vergette appeased him with
difficulty, and, opening a bureau, took out a pair of scales, in one of
which was placed a small cup; and putting them into my hand, told me,
the captain never lost above an ounce and three drams at one time.

While I prepared for this important evacuation, there came into the
cabin a young man gaily dressed, of a very delicate complexion with a
kind of languid smile on his face: which seemed to have been rendered
habitual by a long course of affectation. The captain no sooner
perceived him, than, rising hastily, he flew into his arms, crying,
"O, my dear Simper, I am excessively disordered! I have been betrayed,
frighted, murdered, by the negligence of my servants, who suffered a
beast, a mule, a bear, to surprise me, and stink me into convulsions
with the fumes of tobacco." Simper, who by this time, I found, was
obliged to act for the clearness of his complexion, assumed an air of
softness and sympathy, and lamented with many tender expressions of
sorrow, the sad accident that had thrown him into that condition; then,
feeling his patient's pulse on the outside of his glove, gave it as his
opinion, that his disorder was entirely nervous, and that some drops of
tincture of castor, and liquid laudanum, would be of more service to him
than bleeding, by bridling the inordinate sallies of his spirits, and
composing the fermentation of his bile. I was therefore sent to prepare
this prescription, which was administered in a glass of sack posset,
after the captain had been put to bed, and orders sent to the officers
on the quarter-deck, to let nobody walk on that side under which he lay.

While the captain enjoyed his repose the doctor watched over him, and
indeed became so necessary, that a cabin was made for him contiguous to
the state room where Whiffle slept, that he might be at hand in case of
accidents in the night. Next day, our commander being happily recovered,
gave orders that none of the lieutenants should appear upon deck without
a wig, sword, and ruffles; nor any midshipman, or other petty officer,
be seen with a check shirt or dirty linen. He also prohibited any person
whatever, except Simper and his own servants, from coming into the
great cabin without first sending in to obtain leave. These singular
regulations did not prepossess the ship's company in his favour: but,
on the contrary, gave scandal an opportunity to be very busy with his
character, and accuse him of maintaining a correspondence with his
surgeon not fit to be named.

In a few weeks, our ship being under sailing orders, I was in hope of
revisiting my native country, in a very short time, when the
admiral's surgeon came on board, and, sending for Morgan and me to
the quarter-deck, gave us to understand there was a great scarcity of
surgeons in the West Indies; that he was commanded to detain one mate
out of every great ship that was bound for England; and desired us to
agree between ourselves, before the next day at that hour, which of us
should stay behind. We were thunderstruck at this proposal, and stared
at one another some time without speaking; at length the Welshman broke
silence, and offered to remain in the West Indies, provided the admiral
would give him a surgeon's warrant immediately; but he was told there
was no want of chief surgeons, and that he must be contented with the
station of mate, till he should be further provided for in due
course. Whereupon Morgan flatly refused to quit the ship for which the
commissioners of the navy had appointed him; and the other told him as
plainly, that if we could not determine the affair by ourselves before
to-morrow morning, he must cast lots, and abide by his chance.

When I recalled to my remembrance the miseries I had undergone in
England, where I had not one friend to promote my interest, or favour
my advancement in the navy, and the same time reflected on the present
dearth of surgeons in the West Indies, and the unhealthiness of the
climate, which every day almost reduced the number, I could not help
thinking my success would be much more certain and expeditious by my
staying where I was, than by returning to Europe. I therefore resolved
to comply with a good grace, and next day, when we were ordered to throw
dice, told Morgan he needed not trouble himself, for I would voluntarily
submit to the admiral's pleasure. This frank declaration was commended
by the gentleman, who assured me, it should not fare the worse with me
for my resignation. Indeed he was as good as his word, and that very
afternoon procured a warrant, appointing me surgeon's mate of the Lizard
sloop-of-war, which put me on a footing with every first mate in the
service.

My ticket being made out, I put my chest and bedding on board a canoe
that lay alongside, and, having shook hands with my trusty friend the
sergeant, and honest Jack Rattlin, who was bound for Greenwich Hospital,
I took my leave of Morgan with many tears, after we had exchanged our
sleeve buttons as remembrances of each other. Having presented my new
warrant to the captain of the Lizard, I inquired for the doctor, whom
I no sooner saw than I recollected him to be one of those young fellows
with whom I had been committed to the round-house, during our frolic
with Jackson, as I have related before. He received me with a good deal
of courtesy, and, when I put him in mind of our former acquaintance,
expressed great joy at seeing me again, and recommended me to an
exceeding good mess, composed of the gunner and master's mate. As there
was not one sick person in the ship, I got leave to go ashore next day
with the gunner, who recommended me to a Jew, that bought my ticket at
the rate of forty per cent discount; and, having furnished myself with
the necessaries I wanted, returned on board in the evening, and, to my
surprise, found my old antagonist Crampley walking upon deck. Though
I did not fear his enmity, I was shocked at his appearance, and
communicated my sentiments on that subject to Mr. Tomlins the surgeon,
who told me that Crampley, by dint of some friends about the admiral,
had procured a commission, constituting him lieutenant on board the
Lizard; and advised me, now he was my superior officer, to behave with
some respect towards him, or else he would find a thousand opportunities
of using me ill. This advice was a bitter potion to me, whom pride and
resentment had rendered utterly incapable of the least submission to,
or even of a reconciliation with, the wretch who had, on many occasions,
treated me so inhumanly: however, I resolved to have as little
connection as possible with him, and to ingratiate myself as much as I
could with the rest of the officers, whose friendship might be a bulwark
to defend me from the attempts of his malice.

In less than a week we sailed on a cruise, and having weathered the east
end of the island, had the good fortune to take a Spanish barcolongo,
with her prize, which was an English ship bound for Bristol, that sailed
from Jamaica a fortnight before, without convoy. All the prisoners who
were well, we put onshore on the north side of the island; the prizes
were manned with Englishmen, and the command of the barcolongo given to
my friend the master's mate, with orders to carry them into Port Morant,
and there to remain until the Lizard's cruise should be ended, at which
time she would touch at the same place in her way to Port Royal. With
him I was sent to attend the wounded Spaniards as well as Englishmen,
who amounted to sixteen, and to take care of them on shore in a house
that was to be hired as an hospital. This destination gave me a
great deal of pleasure, as I should, for some time, be freed from the
arrogance of Crampley, whose inveteracy against me had already broken
out on two or three occasions since he was become a lieutenant.
My messmate, who very much resembled my uncle, both in figure and
disposition, treated me on board of the prize with the utmost civility
and confidence: and, among other favours, made me a present of a
silver-hilted hanger, and a pair of pistols mounted with the same metal,
which fell to his share in plundering the enemy. We arrived safely at
Morant, and, going on shore, pitched upon an empty storehouse; which we
hired for the reception of the wounded, who were brought to it next
day, with beds and other necessaries; and four of the ship's company
appointed to attend them and obey me.






CHAPTER XXXVI

A strange adventure--in consequence of which I am extremely
happy--Crampley does me in offices with the Captain; but his malice is
defeated by the good-nature and friendship of the surgeon--we return
to Port Royal--our Captain gets the command of a larger ship, and is
succeeded by an old man--Brayl is provided for--we receive orders to
sail for England

When my patients were all in a fair way, my companion and commander,
whose name was Brayl, carried me up the country to the house of a
rich planter, with whom he was acquainted, where we were sumptuously
entertained, and in the evening set out on our return to the ship. When
we had walked about a mile by moonlight, we perceived a horseman behind
us, who coming up, wished us good even, and asked which way we went? His
voice, which was quite familiar to me, no sooner struck my ear, than in
spite of all my resolution and reflection, my hair bristled up, and I
was seized with a violent fit of trembling, which Brayl misinterpreting,
bade me be under no concern. I told him he was mistaken in the cause of
my disorder; and, addressing myself to the person on horseback said, "I
could have sworn by your voice, that you were a dear friend of mine, if
I had not been certain of his death." To this address, after some pause,
he replied, "There are many voices as well as faces that resemble one
another; but, pray, what was your friend's name." I satisfied him in
that particular, and gave a short detail of the melancholy fate of
Thompson, not without many sighs and some tears. A silence ensued,
which lasted some minutes, and then the conversation turned on different
subjects, till we arrived at a house on the road, where the horseman
alighted, and begged with so much earnestness that we would go in and
drink a bowl of punch with him, that we could not resist. But, if I was
alarmed at his voice, what must my amazement be, when I discovered
by the light the very person of my lamented friend! Perceiving my
confusion, which was extreme, he clasped me in his arms, and bedewed my
face with tears. It was some time ere I recovered the use of my reason,
overpowered with this event, and longer still before I could speak. So
that all I was capable of was to return his embraces, and to mingle the
overflowings of my joy with his; whilst honest Brayl, affected with the
scene, wept as fast as either of us, and signified his participation
of our happiness by hugging us both, and capering about the room like a
madman. At length, I retrieved the use of my tongue, and cried, "Is
it possible! you can be my friend Thompson? No certainly, alas! he was
drowned; and I am now under the deception of a dream!" He was at
great pains to convince me of his being the individual person whom
I regretted, and bidding me sit down and compose myself, promised to
explain his sudden disappearance from the Thunder, and to account for
his being at present in the land of the living. This task he acquitted
himself of, after I had drunk a glass of punch, and recollected my
spirits, by informing us, that with a determination to rid himself of
a miserable existence, he had gone in the night-time to the head, while
the ship was on her way, from whence he slipped down as softly as he
could, by the bows into the sea, where, after he was heartily ducked, he
began to repent of his precipitation; and, as he could swim very well,
kept himself above water, in hopes of being taken up by some of the
ships astern; that, in this situation, he hailed a large vessel, and
begged to be taken in, but was answered that she was a heavy sailer, and
therefore they did not choose to lose time by bringing to; however, they
threw an old chest overboard for his convenience, and told him, that
some of the ships astern would certainly save him; that no other vessel
came within sight or cry of him for the space of three hours, during
which time he had the mortification to find himself in the middle of
the ocean alone, without other support or resting-place, but what a few
crazy boards afforded; till at last he discerned a small sloop steering
towards him, upon which he set up his throat, and had the good fortune
to be heard and rescued from the dreary waste by their boat, which was
hoisted out on purpose.

"I was no sooner brought on board," continued he, "than I fainted, and,
when I recovered my senses, found myself in bed, regaled with a most
noisome smell of onions and cheese, which made me think at first that
I was in my own hammock, alongside of honest Morgan, and that all which
had passed was no more than a dream. Upon inquiry, I understood that I
was on board of a schooner belonging to Rhode Island, bound for Jamaica,
with a cargo of geese, pigs, onions, and cheese, and that the master's
name was Robertson, by birth a North Briton, whom I knew at first sight
to be an old sohoolfellow of mine. When I discovered myself to him, he
was transported with surprise and joy, and begged to know the occasion
of my misfortune, which I did not think fit to disclose, because I
knew his notions with regard to religion were very severe and confined;
therefore contented myself with telling him I fell overboard
by accident; but made no scruple of explaining the nature of my
disagreeable station, and of acquainting him with my determined purpose
never to return to the Thunder man-of-war. Although he was not of my
opinion in that particular, knowing that I must lose my clothes and what
pay was due to me, unless I went back to my duty; yet, when I described
the circumstances of the hellish life I led under the tyrannic sway
of Oakum and Mackshane; and, among other grievances, hinted a
dissatisfaction at the irreligious deportment of my shipmates, and
the want of the true presbyterian gospel doctrine; he changed his
sentiments, and conjured me with great vehemence and zeal to lay aside
all thought of rising in the navy; and, that he might show how much he
had my interest at heart, undertook to provide for me in some shape or
other, before he should leave Jamaica. This promise he performed to my
heart's desire, by recommending me to a gentleman of fortune, with
whom I have lived ever since in quality of surgeon and overseer to his
plantations. He and his lady are now at Kingston, so that I am, for
the present, master of this house, to which, from my soul, I bid you
welcome, and hope you will favour me with your company during the
remaining part of the night."

I needed not a second invitation; but Mr. Brayl, who was a diligent
and excellent officer, could not be persuaded to sleep out of the ship;
however, he supped with us, and, after having drank a cheerful glass,
set out for the vessel, which was not above three miles from the place,
escorted by a couple of stout negroes, whom Mr. Thompson ordered to
conduct him. Never were two friends more happy in the conversation
of each other than we, for the time it lasted. I related to him the
particulars of our attempt upon Carthagena, of which he had heard but an
imperfect account; and he gratified me with a narration of every little
incident of his life since we parted. He assured me, it was with the
utmost difficulty he could resist his inclination of coming down to Port
Royal, to see Morgan and me, of whom he had heard no tidings since the
day of our separation: but that he was restrained by the fear of being
detained as a deserter. He told me that, when he heard my voice in the
dark, he was almost as much surprised as I was at seeing him afterwards:
and, in the confidence of friendship, disclosed a passion he entertained
for the only daughter of the gentleman with whom he lived, who, by his
description, was a very amiable young lady, and did not disdain his
addresses; that he was very much favoured by her parents; and did not
despair of obtaining their consent to the match, which would at once
render him independent of the world. I congratulated him on his good
fortune, which he protested should never make him forget his friends;
and, towards morning, we betook ourselves to rest.

Next day he accompanied me to the ship, where Mr. Brayl entertained him
at dinner, and we having spent the afternoon together, he took his leave
of us in the evening, after he had forced upon me ten pistoles, as a
small token of his affection. In short, while he stayed here, we saw
one another every day, and generally ate at the same table, which was
plentifully supplied by him with all kinds of poultry, butcher's meat,
oranges, limes, lemons, pine-apples, Madeira wine, and excellent rum;
so that this small interval of ten days was by far the most agreeable
period of my life.

At length the Lizard arrived; and my patients being all fit for duty,
they and I were ordered on board of her, where I understood from Mr.
