LARSON'S LUCK

by GERALD VANCE


 Larson couldn't possibly have known what was
 going on in the engine room, yet he acted....


[Illustration: There would be hell to pay; Larson was stunting again.]

"We moor in ten minutes," I said.

We were flying at reduced speed because of the heavy fog we had run into
at the outer fringe of Earth's atmosphere. But I knew we were within
forty or fifty miles of the Trans-Space base. I had counted the miles on
this particular trip because of the load of radium we were carrying from
the Venusian mines. I wouldn't draw a completely relieved breath until
we were down and the stuff was in the hands of the commerce agents.

I eased my position slightly to relieve the pressure on my broken
flipper and grinned at the pilot, Lucky Larson, the screwiest, most
unpredictable void trotter who had ever flown for dear old Trans-Space.

"You've been too good to be true this trip," I said, "and it's a good
thing. The chief told me that if you so much as _thought_ about clowning
around or stunting he was going to clip your wings for good."
