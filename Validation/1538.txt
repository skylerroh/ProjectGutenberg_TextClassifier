CHAPTER I. CEDAR MOUNTAIN


The first youth rode to the crest of the hill, and, still sitting on his
horse, examined the country in the south with minute care through a pair
of powerful glasses. The other two dismounted and waited patiently. All
three were thin and their faces were darkened by sun and wind. But they
were strong alike of body and soul. Beneath the faded blue uniforms
brave hearts beat and powerful muscles responded at once to every
command of the will.

"What do you see, Dick?" asked Warner, who leaned easily against his
horse, with one arm over the pommel of his saddle.

"Hills, valleys, mountains, the August heat shimmering over all, but no
human being."

"A fine country," said young Pennington, "and I like to look at it, but
just now my Nebraska prairie would be better for us. We could at least
see the advance of Stonewall Jackson before he was right on top of us."

Dick took another long look, searching every point in the half circle
of the south with his glasses. Although burned by summer the country
was beautiful, and neither heat nor cold could take away its
picturesqueness. He saw valleys in which the grass grew thick and
strong, clusters of hills dotted with trees, and then the blue loom of
mountains clothed heavily with foliage. Over everything bent a dazzling
sky of blue and gold.

The light was so intense that with his glasses he could pick out
individual trees and rocks on the far slopes. He saw an occasional roof,
but nowhere did he see man. He knew the reason, but he had become so
used to his trade that at the moment, he felt no sadness. All this
region had been swept by great armies. Here the tide of battle in
the mightiest of all wars had rolled back and forth, and here it was
destined to surge again in a volume increasing always.

"I don't find anything," repeated Dick, "but three pairs of eyes are
better than none. George, you take the glasses and see what you can see
and Frank will follow."

He dismounted and stood holding the reins of his horse while the young
Vermonter looked. He noticed that the mathematical turn of Warner's
mind showed in every emergency. He swept the glasses back and forth in
a regular curve, not looking here and now there, but taking his time and
missing nothing. It occurred to Dick that he was a type of his region,
slow but thorough, and sure to win after defeat.

"What's the result of your examination?" asked Dick as Warner passed the
glasses in turn to Pennington.

"Let x equal what I saw, which is nothing. Let y equal the result I
draw, which is nothing. Hence we have x + y which still equals nothing."

Pennington was swifter in his examination. The blood in his veins flowed
a little faster than Warner's.

"I find nothing but land and water," he said without waiting to be
asked, "and I'm disappointed. I had a hope, Dick, that I'd see Stonewall
Jackson himself riding along a slope."

"Even if you saw him, how would you know it was Stonewall?"

"I hadn't thought of that. We've heard so much of him that it just
seemed to me I'd know him anywhere."

"Same here," said Warner. "Remember all the tales we've heard about his
whiskers, his old slouch hat and his sorrel horse."

"I'd like to see him myself," confessed Dick. "From all we hear he's
the man who kept McClellan from taking Richmond. He certainly played
hob with the plans of our generals. You know, I've got a cousin, Harry
Kenton, with him. I had a letter from him a week ago--passing through
the lines, and coming in a round-about way. Writes as if he thought
Stonewall Jackson was a demigod. Says we'd better quit and go home, as
we haven't any earthly chance to win this war."

"He fights best who wins last," said Warner. "I'm thinking I won't see
the green hills of Vermont for a long time yet, because I mean to pay
a visit to Richmond first. Have you got your cousin's letter with you,
Dick?"

"No, I destroyed it. I didn't want it bobbing up some time or other to
cause either of us trouble. A man I know at home says he's kept out of a
lot of trouble by 'never writin' nothin' to nobody.' And if you do write
a letter the next best thing is to burn it as quick as you can."

"If my eyes tell the truth, and they do," said Pennington, "here comes
a short, thick man riding a long, thick horse and he--the man, not the
horse--bears a startling resemblance to our friend, ally, guide and
sometime mentor, Sergeant Daniel Whitley."

"Yes, it's the sergeant," said Dick, looking down into the valley, "and
I'm glad he's joining us. Do you know, boys, I often think these veteran
sergeants know more than some of our generals."

"It's not an opinion. It's a fact," said Warner. "Hi, there, sergeant!
Here are your friends! Come up and make the same empty report that we've
got ready for the colonel."

Sergeant Daniel Whitley looked at the three lads, and his face
brightened. He had a good intellect under his thatch of hair, and a warm
heart within his strong body. The boys, although lieutenants, and he
only a sergeant in the ranks, treated him usually as an equal and often
as a superior.

Colonel Winchester's regiment and the remains of Colonel Newcomb's
Pennsylvanians had been sent east after the defeat of the Union army at
the Seven Days, and were now with Pope's Army of Virginia, which was to
hold the valley and also protect Washington. Grant's success at
Shiloh had been offset by McClellan's failure before Richmond, and the
President and his Cabinet at Washington were filled with justifiable
alarm. Pope was a western man, a Kentuckian, and he had insisted upon
having some of the western troops with him.

The sergeant rode his horse slowly up the slope, and joined the lads
over whom he watched like a father.
