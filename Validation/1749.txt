nothing at all save that she was with mother in the country; that it had
been rather a sad journey, with mother so quiet and pale, and that she
would be very glad to see supper, should it rise like a fairy banquet in
the midst of these strange surroundings.

It was only a mile and a half from the railway station to the Shaker
Settlement, and Susanna knew the road well, for she had driven over it
more than once as child and girl. A boy would bring the little trunk
that contained their simple necessities later on in the evening, so
she and Sue would knock at the door of the house where visitors were
admitted, and be undisturbed by any gossiping company while they were
pleading their case.

"Are we most there, Mardie?" asked Sue for the twentieth time. "Look at
me! I'm being a butterfly, or perhaps a white pigeon. No, I'd rather be
a butterfly, and then I can skim along faster and move my wings!"

The airy little figure, all lightness and brightness, danced along the
road, the white cotton dress rising and falling, the white-stockinged
legs much in evidence, the arms outstretched as if in flight, straw hat
falling off yellow hair, and a little wisp of swansdown scarf floating
out behind like the drapery of a baby Mercury.

"We are almost there," her mother answered. "You can see the buildings
now, if you will stop being a butterfly. Don't you like them?"

"Yes, I 'specially like them all so white. Is it a town, Mardie?"

"It is a village, but not quite like other villages. I have told you
often about the Shaker Settlement, where your grandmother brought me
once when I was just your age. There was a thunder-storm; they kept
us all night, and were so kind that I never forgot them. Then your
grandmother and I stopped off once when we were going to Boston. I was
ten then, and I remember more about it. The same sweet Eldress was there
both times."

"What is an El-der-ess, Mardie?"

"A kind of everybody's mother, she seemed to be," Susanna responded,
with a catch in her breath.

"I'd 'specially like her; will she be there now, Mardie?"

"I'm hoping so, but it is eighteen years ago. I was ten and she was
about forty, I should think."

"Then o' course she'll be dead," said Sue, cheerfully, "or either she'll
have no teeth or hair."

"People don't always die before they are sixty, Sue."

"Do they die when they want to, or when they must?"

"Always when they must; never, never when they want to," answered Sue's
mother.

"But o' course they would n't ever want to if they had any little girls
to be togedder with, like you and me, Mardie?" And Sue looked up with
eyes that were always like two interrogation points, eager by turns and
by turns wistful, but never satisfied.

"No," Susanna replied brokenly, "of course they would n't, unless
sometimes they were wicked for a minute or two and forgot."

"Do the Shakers shake all the time, Mardie, or just once in a while? And
shall I see them do it?"

"Sue, dear, I can't explain everything in the world to you while you are
so little; you really must wait until you're more grown up. The Shakers
don't shake and the Quakers don't quake, and when you're older, I'll
try to make you understand why they were called so and why they kept the
name."

"Maybe the El-der-ess can make me understand right off now; I'd
'specially like it." And Sue ran breathlessly along to the gate where
the North Family House stood in its stately, white-and-green austerity.

Susanna followed, and as she caught up with the impetuous Sue, the front
door of the house opened and a figure appeared on the threshold. Mother
and child quickened their pace and went up the steps, Susanna with
a hopeless burden of fear and embarrassment clogging her tongue and
dragging at her feet; Sue so expectant of new disclosures and fresh
experiences that her face beamed like a full moon.

Eldress Abby (for it was Eldress Abby) had indeed survived the heavy
weight of her fifty-five or sixty summers, and looked as if she might
reach a yet greater age. She wore the simple Shaker afternoon dress of
drab alpaca; an irreproachable muslin surplice encircled her straight,
spare shoulders, while her hair was almost entirely concealed by the
stiffly wired, transparent white-net cap that served as a frame to the
tranquil face. The face itself was a network of delicate, fine wrinkles;
but every wrinkle must have been as lovely in God's sight as it was in
poor unhappy Susanna Hathaway's. Some of them were graven by self-denial
and hard work; others perhaps meant the giving up of home, of parents
and brothers or sisters; perhaps some worldly love, the love that Father
Adam bequeathed to the human family, had been slain in Abby's youth, and
the scars still remained to show the body's suffering and the spirit's
triumph. At all events, whatever foes had menaced her purity or her
tranquillity had been conquered, and she exhaled serenity as the rose
sheds fragrance.

"Do you remember the little Nelson girl and her mother that stayed here
all night, years ago?" asked Susanna, putting out her hand timidly.

"Why, seems to me I do," assented Eldress Abby, genially. "So many
comes and goes it's hard to remember all. Did n't you come once in a
thunder-storm?"

"Yes, one of your barns was struck by lightning and we sat up all
night." "Yee, yee.(1) I remember well! Your mother was a beautiful
spirit. I could n't forget her."

     (1)"Yea" is always thus pronounced by the Shakers.

"And we came once again, mother and I, and spent the afternoon with you,
and went strawberrying in the pasture."

"Yee, yee, so we did; I hope your mother continues in health."

"She died the very next year," Susanna answered in a trembling voice,
for the time of explanation was near at hand and her heart failed her.

"Won't you come into the sittingroom and rest a while? You must be tired
walking from the deepot."

"No, thank you, not just yet. I'll step into the front entry a
minute.--Sue, run and sit in that rocking-chair on the porch and watch
the cows going into the big barn.--Do you remember, Eldress Abby, the
second time I came, how you sat me down in the kitchen with a bowl of
wild strawberries to hull for supper? They were very small and ripe; I
did my best, for I never meant to be careless, but the bowl slipped and
fell, my legs were too short to reach the floor, and I could n't make a
lap, so in trying to pick up the berries I spilled juice on nay dress,
and on the white apron you had tied on for me. Then my fingers were
stained and wet and the hulls kept falling in with the soft berries,
and when you came in and saw me you held up your hands and said, 'Dear,
dear! you _have_ made a mess of your work!' Oh, Eldress Abby, they've
come back to me all day, those words. I've tried hard to be good, but
somehow I've made just such a mess of my life as I made of hulling the
berries. The bowl is broken, I have n't much fruit to show, and I am
all stained and draggled. I should n't have come to Albion on the five
o'clock train--that was an accident; I meant to come at noon, when you
could turn me away if you wanted to."

"Nay, that is not the Shaker habit," remonstrated Abby. "You and the
child can sleep in one of the spare chambers at the Office Building and
be welcome."

"But I want much more than that," said Susanna, tearfully. "I want to
come and live here, where there is no marrying nor giving in marriage.
I am so tired with my disappointments and discouragements and failures
that it is no use to try any longer. I am Mrs. Hathaway, and Sue is my
child, but I have left my husband for good and all, and I only want
to spend the rest of my days here in peace and bring up Sue to a more
tranquil life than I have ever had. I have a little money, so that I
shall not be a burden to you, and I will work from morning to night at
any task you set me."

"I will talk to the Family," said Eldress Abby gravely; "but there are a
good many things to settle before we can say yee to all you ask."

"Let me confess everything freely and fully," pleaded Susanna, "and if
you think I'm to blame, I will go away at once."

"Nay, this is no time for that. It is our duty to receive all and try
all; then if you should be gathered in, you would unburden your heart to
God through the Sister appointed to receive your confession."

"Will Sue have to sleep in the children's building away from me?"

"Nay, not now; you are company, not a Shaker, and anyway you could keep
the child with you till she is a little older; that's not forbidden
at first, though there comes a time when the ties of the flesh must be
broken! All you've got to do now's to be 'pure and peaceable, gentle,
easy to be entreated, and without hypocrisy.' That's about all there is
to the Shaker creed, and that's enough to keep us all busy."

Sue ran in from the porch excitedly and caught her mother's hand.

"The cows have all gone into the barn," she chattered; "and the Shaker
gentlemen are milking them, and not one of them is shaking the least
bit, for I 'specially noticed; and I looked in through the porch window,
and there is nice supper on a table--bread and butter and milk and dried
apple sauce and gingerbread and cottage cheese. Is it for us, Mardie?"

Susanna's lip was trembling and her face was pale. She lifted her
swimming eyes to the Sister's and asked, "Is it for us, Eldress Abby?"

"Yee, it's for you," she answered; "there's always a Shaker supper on
the table for all who want to leave the husks and share the feast. Come
right in and help yourselves. I will sit down with you."


Supper was over, and Susanna and Sue were lying in a little upper
chamber under the stars. It was the very one that Susanna had slept in
as a child, or that she had been put to bed in, for there was little
sleep that night for any one. She had leaned on the windowsill with her
mother and watched the pillar of flame and smoke ascend from the burning
barn; and once in the early morning she had stolen out of bed, and,
kneeling by the open window, had watched the two silent Shaker brothers
who were guarding the smouldering ruins, fearful lest the wind should
rise and bear any spark to the roofs of the precious buildings they had
labored so hard to save.

The chamber was spotless and devoid of ornament. The paint was robin's
egg blue and of a satin gloss. The shining floor was of the same color,
and neat braided rugs covered exposed places near the bureau, washstand,
and bed. Various useful articles of Shaker manufacture interested Sue
greatly: the exquisite straw-work that covered the whisk-broom; the
mending-basket, pincushion, needle-book, spool- and watch-cases,
hair-receivers, pin-trays, might all have been put together by fairy
fingers.

Sue's prayers had been fervent, but a trifle disjointed, covering all
subjects from Jack and Fardie, to Grandma in heaven and Aunt Louisa
at the farm, with special references to El-der-ess Abby and the Shaker
cows, and petitions that the next day be fair so that she could see them
milked. Excitement at her strange, unaccustomed surroundings had put the
child's mind in a very whirl, and she had astonished her mother with a
very new and disturbing version of the Lord's Prayer, ending: "God give
us our debts and help us to forget our debtors and theirs shall be the
glory, Amen." Now she lay quietly on the wall side of the clean, narrow
bed, while her mother listened to hear the regular breathing that would
mean that she was off for the land of dreams. The child's sleep would
leave the mother free to slip out of bed and look at the stars; free to
pray and long and wonder and suffer and repent, not wholly, but in part,
for she was really at peace in all but the innermost citadel of her
conscience. She had left her husband, and for the moment, at all events,
she was fiercely glad; but she had left her boy, and Jack was only ten.
Jack was not the helpless, clinging sort; he was a little piece of his
father, and his favorite. Aunt Louisa would surely take him, and Jack
would scarcely feel the difference, for he had never shown any special
affection for anybody. Still he was her child, nobody could possibly
get around that fact, and it was a stumbling-block in the way of
forgetfulness or ease of mind. Oh, but for that, what unspeakable
content she could feel in this quiet haven, this self-respecting
solitude! To have her thoughts, her emotions, her words, her self,
to herself once more, as she had had them before she was married at
seventeen. To go to sleep in peace, without listening for a step she had
once heard with gladness, but that now sometimes stumbled unsteadily on
the stair; or to dream as happy women dreamed, without being roused by
the voice of the present John, a voice so different from that of the
past John that it made the heart ache to listen to it.

Sue's voice broke the stillness: "How long are we going to stay here,
Mardie?"

"I don't know, Sue; I think perhaps as long as they'll let us."

"Will Fardie come and see us?"

"I don't expect him."

"Who'll take care of Jack, Mardie?"

"Your Aunt Louisa."

"She'll scold him awfully, but he never cries; he just says, 'Pooh! what
do I care?' Oh, I forgot to pray for that very nicest Shaker gentleman
that said he'd let me help him feed the calves! Had n't I better get out
of bed and do it? I'd 'specially like to."

"Very well, Sue; and then go to sleep."

Safely in bed again, there was a long pause, and then the eager little
voice began, "Who'll take care of Fardie now?"

"He's a big man; he does n't need anybody."

"What if he's sick?"

"We must go back to him, I suppose."

"Tomorrow 's Sunday; what if he needs us tomorrow, Mardie?"

"I don't know, I don't know! Oh, Sue, Sue, don't ask your wretched
mother any more questions, for she cannot bear them tonight. Cuddle
up close to her; love her and forgive her and help her to know what's
right."




II. A Son of Adam

When Susanna Nelson at seventeen married John Hathaway, she had the
usual cogent reasons for so doing, with some rather more unusual ones
added thereto. She was alone in the world, and her life with an uncle,
her mother's only relative, was an unhappy one. No assistance in the
household tasks that she had ever been able to render made her a welcome
member of the family or kept her from feeling a burden, and she belonged
no more to the little circle at seventeen than she did when she became a
part of it at twelve. The hope of being independent and earning her own
living had sustained her through the last year; but it was a very timid,
self-distrustful, love-starved little heart that John Hathaway stormed
and carried by assault. Her girl's life in a country school and her
uncle's very rigid and orthodox home had been devoid of emotion or
experience; still, her mother had early sown seeds in her mind and
spirit that even in the most arid soil were certain to flower into
beauty when the time for flowering came; and intellectually Susanna was
the clever daughter of clever parents. She was very immature, because,
after early childhood, her environment had not been favorable to her
development. At seventeen she began to dream of a future as bright
as the past had been dreary and uneventful. Visions of happiness, of
goodness, and of service haunted her, and sometimes, gleaming through
the mists of dawning womanhood, the figure, all luminous, of The Man!

When John Hathaway appeared on the horizon, she promptly clothed him in
all the beautiful garments of her dreams; they were a grotesque misfit,
but when we intimate that women have confused the dream and the reality
before, and may even do so again, we make the only possible excuse for
poor little Susanna Nelson.

John Hathaway was the very image of the outer world that lay beyond
Susanna's village. He was a fairly prosperous, genial, handsome young
merchant, who looked upon life as a place furnished by Providence in
which to have "a good time." His parents had frequently told him that
it was expedient for him to "settle down," and he supposed that he might
finally do so, if he should ever find a girl who would tempt him to
relinquish his liberty. (The line that divides liberty and license was
a little vague to John Hathaway!) It is curious that he should not
have chosen for his life-partner some thoughtless, rosy, romping young
person, whose highest conception of connubial happiness would have been
to drive twenty miles to the seashore on a Sunday, and having partaken
of all the season's delicacies, solid and liquid, to come home hilarious
by moonlight. That, however, is not the way the little love-imps do
their work in the world; or is it possible that they are not imps at all
who provoke and stimulate and arrange these strange marriages not imps,
but honest, chastening little character-builders? In any event, the
moment that John Hathaway first beheld Susanna Nelson was the moment
of his surrender; yet the wooing was as incomprehensible as that of a
fragile, dainty little hummingbird by a pompous, greedy, big-breasted
robin.

Susanna was like a New England anemone. Her face was oval in shape and
as smooth and pale as a pearl. Her hair was dark, not very heavy, and as
soft as a child's. Her lips were delicate and sensitive, her eyes a cool
gray,--clear, steady, and shaded by darker lashes. When John Hathaway
met her shy, maidenly glance and heard her pretty, dovelike voice, it
is strange he did not see that there was a bit too much saint in her to
make her a willing comrade of his gay, roistering life. But as a matter
of fact, John Hathaway saw nothing at all; nothing but that Susanna
Nelson was a lovely girl and he wanted her for his own. The type was
one he had never met before, one that allured him by its mysteries and
piqued him by its shy aloofness.

John had "a way with him," a way that speedily won Susanna; and after
all there was a best to him as well as a worst. He had a twinkling
eye, an infectious laugh, a sweet disposition, and while he was
over-susceptible to the charm of a pretty face, he had a chivalrous
admiration for all women, coupled, it must be confessed, with a decided
lack of discrimination in values. His boyish lightheartedness had a
charm for everybody, including Susanna; a charm that lasted until she
discovered that his heart was light not only when it ought to be light,
but when it ought to be heavy. He was very much in love with her,
but there was nothing particularly exclusive, unique, individual, or
interesting about his passion at that time. It was of the everyday sort
which carries a well-meaning man to the altar, and sometimes, in cases
of exceptional fervor and duration, even a little farther. Stock sizes
of this article are common and inexpensive, and John Hathaway's love
when he married Susanna was, judged by the highest standards, about
as trivial an affair as Cupid ever put upon the market or a man ever
offered to a woman. Susanna on the same day offered John, or the wooden
idol she was worshiping as John, her whole self--mind, body, heart,
and spirit. So the couple were united, and smilingly signed the
marriage-register, a rite by which their love for each other was
supposed to be made eternal.

  "Will you love me?" said he.
  "Will you love me?" said she.
  Then they answered together:
  "Through foul and fair weather,
  From sunrise to moonrise,
  From moonrise to sunrise,
  By heath and by harbour,
  In orchard or arbour,
  In the time of the rose,
  In the time of the snows,
  Through smoke and through smother
  We'll love one another!"

Cinderella, when the lover-prince discovers her and fits the crystal
slipper to her foot, makes short work of flinging away her rags; and
in some such pretty, airy, unthinking way did Susanna fling aside the
dullness, inhospitality, and ugliness of her uncle's home and depart in
a cloud of glory on her wedding journey. She had been lonely, now she
would have companionship. She had been of no consequence, now she would
be queen of her own small domain. She had been last with everybody, now
she would be first with one, at least. She had worked hard and received
neither compensation nor gratitude; henceforward her service would be
gladly rendered at an altar where votive offerings would not be taken
as a matter of course. She was only a slip of a girl now; marriage and
housewifely cares would make her a woman. Some time perhaps the last
great experience of life would come to her, and then what a crown of
joys would be hers,--love, husband, home, children! What a vision it
was, and how soon the chief glory of it faded!

Never were two beings more hopelessly unlike than John Hathaway
single and John Hathaway married, but the bliss lasted a few years,
nevertheless: partly because Susanna's charm was deep and penetrating,
the sort to hold a false man for a time and a true man forever; partly
because she tried, as a girl or woman has seldom tried before, to do her
duty and to keep her own ideal unshattered.
