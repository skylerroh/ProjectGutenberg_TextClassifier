
There are two possibilities of thought concerning these clusters.
Either that they belong to our stellar system, and hence the stars
must be small and young, or they are another universe of millions
of suns, so far way that the inconceivable distances between the
stars are shrunken to a hand's-breadth, and their unbearable splendor
of innumerable suns can only make a gray haze at the distance at
which we behold them. The latter is the older and grander thought;
the former the newer and better substantiated.

_Nebulae._

The gorgeous clusters we have been considering appear to the eye
or the small telescope as little cloudlets of hazy light. One after
another were resolved into stars; and the natural conclusion was,
that all would yield and reveal themselves to be clustered suns,
when we had telescopes of sufficient power. But the spectroscope,
seeing not merely form but substance also, shows that some of them
are not stars in any sense, but masses of glowing gas. Two of these
nebulae are visible to the naked eye: one in Andromeda (see Fig.
68), and one around the middle star of the sword of Orion, shown
in Fig.78. A three-inch telescope resolves th Orionis into the
famous trapezium, and a nine-inch instrument sees two stars more.
The shape of the nebula is changeable, and is hardly suggestive of
the moulding influence of gravitation. It is probably composed of
glowing nitrogen and hydrogen gases. Nebulae are of all conceivable
shapes--circular, annular, oval, lenticular, [Page 218] conical,
spiral, snake-like, looped, and nameless. Compare the sprays of the
Crab nebulae above z Tauri, seen in Fig. 79, and the ring nebula,
Fig. 80. This last possibly consists of stars, and is situated, as
shown in Fig. 81, midway between b and g Lyrae.

[Illustration: Fig. 78.--The great Nebula about the multiple Star
th Orionis. (See Frontispiece.)]

When Herschel was sweeping the heavens with his telescope, and
saw but few stars, he often said to his assistant, "Prepare to
write; the nebulae are coming." They are most abundant where the
stars are least so. A zone about the heavens 30 deg. wide, with the
Milky Way in the centre, would include one-fourth of the celestial
sphere; but instead of one-fourth, we find nine-tenths
[Page 219]
of the stars in this zone, and but one-tenth of the nebulae.

These immense masses of unorganized matter are noticed to change
their forms, vary their light greatly, but not quickly; they change
through the ages. "God works slowly." He takes a thousand years
to lift his hand off.

[Illustration: Fig. 79.--Crab Nebula, near z Tauri. (See Frontispiece.)]

There are many unsolved problems connected with these strange bodies.
Whether they belong to our system, or are beyond it, is not settled;
the weight of evidence leans to the first view.

[Page 220]
_Variable Stars._

[Illustration: Fig. 80.--The Ring Nebula.]

Our sun gives a variable amount of light, changing through a period
of eleven years. Probably every star, if examined by methods
sufficiently delicate and exact, would be found to be variable.
The variations of some [Page 221] stars are so marked as to
challenge investigation. b Lyrae (Fig. 81) has two maxima and minima
of light. In three days it rises from magnitude 4-1/2 to 3-1/2; in a
week falls to 4, and rises to 3-1/2; and in three days more drops to
4-1/2: it makes all these changes in thirteen days; but this period
is constantly increasing. The variations of one hundred and
forty-three stars have been well ascertained.

[Illustration: Fig. 81.--Constellation Lyra, showing place of the
Ring Nebula.]

Mira, or the Wonderful, in the Whale (Fig. 68), is easily found when
visible. Align from Capella to the Pleiades, and as much farther,
and four stars will be seen, situated thus:

    *
  *  * *

The right-hand one is Mira. For half a month it shines as a star
of the second magnitude. Then for three months it fades away, and
lost to sight; going down even to the eleventh magnitude. But after
five months its resurrection morning mes; and in three months
more--eleven months in all--our Wonderful is in its full glory
in the heavens. It its period and brilliancy are also variable.
The star Megrez, d in the Great Bear, has been growing dim [Page
222] for a century. In 1836 Betelguese was exceedingly variable, and
continued so till 1840, when the changes became much less
conspicuous. Algol (Fig. 68) has been already referred to. This
slowly winking eye is of the second magnitude during 2d. 14h. Then
it dozes off toward sleep for 4h. 24m., when it is nearly invisible.
It wakes up during the same time; so that its period from maximum
brilliancy to the same state again is 2d. 20h. 48m. Its recognizable
changes are within five or six hours. As I write, March 25th, 1879,
Algol gives its minimum light at 9h. 36m. P.M. It passes fifteen
minima in 43d. 13m. There will therefore be another minimum May 7th,
at 9h. 49m. Its future periods are easy to estimate. Perhaps it has
some dark body revolving about it at frightful speed, in a period of
less than three days. The period of its variability is growing
shorter at an increasing rate. If its variability is caused by a
dark body revolving about it, the orbit of that body is contracting,
and the huge satellite will soon, as celestial periods are reckoned,
commence to graze the surface of the sun itself, rebound again and
again, and at length plunge itself into the central fire. Such an
event would evolve heat enough to make Algol flame up into a star of
the first magnitude, and perhaps out-blaze Sirius or Capella in our
winter sky.

None of the causes for these changes we have been able to conjecture
seem very satisfactory. The stars may have opaque planets revolving
about them, shutting off their light; they may rotate, and have
unequally illuminated sides; they may revolve in very elliptical
orbits, so as to greatly alter their distance from us; they may
be so situated in regard to zones of meteorites as [Page 223] to
call down periodically vast showers; but none or all of these
suppositions apply to all cases, if they do to any.

_Temporary, New, and Lost Stars._

Besides regular movements to right and left, up and down, to and
from us--changes in the intensity of illumination by changes of
distance--besides variations occurring at regular and ascertainable
intervals, there are stars called _temporary_, shining awhile and
then disappearing; _new_, coming to a definite brightness, and so
remaining; and _lost_, those whose first appearance was not observed,
but which have utterly disappeared.

In November, 1572, a new star blazed out in Cassiopeia. Its place
is shown in Fig. 67, ch g being the stars

  d    *
   g ch

in the seat of the chair, and d being the first one in the back.
This star was visible at noonday, and was brighter than any other
star in the heavens. In January, 1573, it was less bright than
Jupiter; in April it was below the second magnitude, and the last
of May it utterly disappeared. It was as variable in color as in
brilliancy. During its first two months, the period of greatest
brightness, it was dazzling white, then became yellow, and finally
as red as Mars or Aldebaran, and so expired.

A bright star was seen very near to the place of the _Pilgrim_,
as the star of 1572 was called, in A.D. 945 and 1264. A star of
the tenth magnitude is now seen brightening slowly almost exactly
in the same place. It is possible that this is a variable star
of a period of about three hundred and ten years, and will blaze
out again about 1885.

But we have had, within a few years, fine opportunities [Page 224]
to study, with improved instruments, two new stars; On the evening
of May 12th, 1866, a star of the second magnitude was observed in
the Northern Crown, where no star above the fifth magnitude had been
twenty-four hours before. In Argelander's chart a star of the tenth
magnitude occupies the place. May 13th it had declined to the third
magnitude, May 16th to the fourth, May 17th to the fifth, May 19th
to the seventh, May 31st to the ninth, and has since diminished to
the tenth. The spectroscope showed it to be a star in the usual
condition; but through the usual colored spectrum, crossed with
bright lines, shone four bright lines, two of which indicated
glowing hydrogen. Here was plenty of proof that an unusual amount of
this gas had given this sun its sudden flame. As the hydrogen burned
out the star grew dim.

Two theories immediately presented themselves: First, that vast
volumes had been liberated from within the orb by some sudden breaking
up of the doors of its great deeps; or, second, this star had
precipitated upon itself, by attraction, some other sun or planet,
the force of whose impact had been changed into heat.

Though we see the liberated hydrogen of our sun burst up with sudden
flame, it can hardly be supposed that enough could be liberated
at once to increase the light and heat one hundred-fold.

In regard to the second theory, it is capable of proof that two
suns half as large as ours, moving at a velocity of four hundred
and seventy-six miles per second, would evolve heat enough to supply
the radiation of our sun for fifty million years. How could it be
possible for a sun like this newly blazing orb to cool off to such a
[Page 225] degree in a month? Besides, there would not be one chance
in a thousand for two orbs to come directly together. They would
revolve about each other till a kind of grazing contact of grinding
worlds would slowly kindle the ultimate heat.

It is far more likely that this star encountered an enormous stream
of meteoric bodies, or perhaps absorbed a whole comet, that laid
its million leagues of tail as fuel on the central fire. Only let
it be remembered that the fuel is far more force than substance.
Allusion has already been made to the sudden brightening of our
sun on the first day of September, 1859. That was caused, no doubt,
by the fall of large meteors, following in the train of the comet
of 1843, or some other comet. What the effect would have been, had
the whole mass of the comet been absorbed, cannot be imagined.

Another new star lately appeared in Cygnus, near the famous star
61--the first star in the northern hemisphere whose distance was
determined. It was first seen November 24th, 1876, as a third magnitude
star of a yellow color. By December 2d it had sunk to the fourth
magnitude, and changed to a greenish color. It had then three bright
hydrogen lines, the strong double sodium line, and others, which
made, it strongly resemble the spectrum of the chromosphere of our
sun. An entirely different result appeared in the fading of these
two stars. In the case of the star in the Crown, the extraordinary
light was the first to fade, leaving the usual stellar spectrum. In
the case of the star in Cygnus, the part of the spectrum belonging
to stellar light was the first to fade, leaving the bright lines;
that is, the gas of one gave way to regular starlight, and the
starlight [Page 226] of the other having faded, the regular light of
the glowing gas continued. By some strange oversight, no one studied
the star again for six months. In September and November, 1877, the
light of this star was found to be blue, and not to be starlight at
all. It had no rainbow spectrum, only one kind of rays, and hence
only one color. Its sole spectroscopic line is believed to be that
of glowing nitrogen gas. We have then, probably, in the star of
1876, a body shining by a feeble and undiscernible light, surrounded
by a discernible immensity of light of nitrogen gas. This is its
usual condition; but if a flight of meteors should raise the heat of
the central body so as to outshine the nebulous envelope, we should
have the conditions we discovered in November, 1876. But a rapid
cooling dissipates the observable light of all colors, and leaves
only the glowing gas of one color.

_Movements of Stars._

We call the stars _fixed_, but motion and life are necessary to all
things. Besides the motion in the line of sight described already,
there is motion in every other conceivable direction. We knew Sirius
moved before we had found the cause. We know that our sun moves
back and forth in his easy bed one-half his vast diameter, as the
larger planets combine their influence on one side or the other.

The sun has another movement. We find the stars in Hercules gradually
spreading from each other. Hercules's brawny limbs grow brawnier
every century. There can be but one cause: we are approaching that
quarter of the heavens. (See [Symbol], Fig. 72.) We are even [Page
227] able to compute the velocity of our approach; it is four miles
a second. The stars in the opposite quarter of the heavens in Argo
are drawing nearer together.

This movement would have no effect on the apparent place of the
stars at either pole, if they were all equally distant; but it
must greatly extend or contract the apparent space between them,
since they are situated at various distances.

Independent of this, the stars themselves are all in motion, but so
vast is the distance from which we observe them that it has taken
an accumulation of centuries before they could be made measurable.
A train going forty miles an hour, seen from a distance of two
miles, almost seems to stand still. Arcturus moves through space
three times as fast as the earth, but it takes a century to appear
to move the eighth part of the diameter of the moon. There is a
star in the Hunting Dogs, known as 1830 Groombridge, which has a
velocity beyond what all the attraction of the matter of the known
universe could give it. By the year 9000 it may be in Berenice's
Hair.

Some stars have a common movement, being evidently related together.
A large proportion of the brighter stars between Aldebaran and
the Pleiades have a common motion eastward of about ten seconds
a century. All the angles marked by a, b, g, ch Orionis will be
altered in different directions; l is moving toward g. l and e
will appear as a double star. In A.D. 50,000 Procyon will be nearer
ch Orionis than Rigel now is, and Sirius will be in line with a and
ch Orionis. All the stars of the Great Dipper, except Benetnasch
and Dubhe, have a common motion somewhat in the direction [Page 228]
of Thuban (Fig. 67), while the two named have a motion nearly
opposite. In 36,000 years the end of the Dipper will have fallen out
so that it will hold no water, and the handle will be broken square
off at Mizar. "The Southern Cross," says Humboldt, "will not always
keep its characteristic form, for its four stars travel in different
directions with unequal velocities. At the present time it is not
known how many myriads of years must elapse before its entire
dislocation."

These movements are not in fortuitous or chaotic ways, but are
doubtless in accordance with some perfect plan. We have climbed
up from revolving earth and moon to revolving planets and sun,
in order to understand how two or ten suns can revolve about a
common centre. Let us now leap to the grander idea that all the
innumerable stars of a winter night not only loan, but must revolve
about some centre of gravity. Men have been looking for a central
sun of suns, and have not found it. None is needed. Two suns can
balance about a point; all suns can swing about a common centre.
That one unmoving centre may be that city more gorgeous than Eastern
imagination ever conceived, whose pavement is transparent gold,
whose walls are precious stones, whose light is life, and where
no dark planetary bodies ever cast shadows. There reigns the King
and Lord of all, and ranged about are the far-off provinces of his
material systems. They all move in his sight, and receive power
from a mind that never wearies.

THE WORLDS AND THE WORD.

"The worlds were framed by the word of God."--_Heb._ xi., 3.

[Page 230]
  "Mysterious night! when our first parent knew thee
  From report divine, and heard thy name,
  Did he not tremble for this lovely frame,
  This glorious canopy of light and blue?
  Yet, 'neath a curtain of translucent dew,
  Bathed in the rays of the great setting flame,
  Hesperus, with all the host of heaven, came,
  And lo! creation widened in man's view.
  Who could have thought such darkness lay concealed
  Within thy beams, O Sun! Oh who could find,
  Whilst fruit and leaf and insect stood revealed,
  That to such countless worlds thou mad'st us blind!
  Why do we then shun death with anxious strife?
  If light conceal so much, wherefore not life?"
    BLANCO WHITE.

_THE WORLDS AND THE WORD._

Men have found the various worlds to be far richer than they originally
thought. They have opened door after door in their vast treasuries,
have ascended throne after throne of power, and ruled realms of
increasing extent. We have no doubt that unfoldings in the future
will amaze even those whose expectations have been quickened by
the revealings of the past. What if it be found that the Word is
equally inexhaustible?

After ages of thought and discovery we have come out of the darkness
and misconceptions of men. We believe in no serpent, turtle, or
elephant supporting the world; no Atlas holding up the heavens;
no crystal domes, "with cycles and epicycles scribbled o'er." What
if it be found that one book, written by ignorant men, never fell
into these mistakes of the wisest! Nay, more, what if some of the
greatest triumphs of modern science are to be found plainly stated
in a book older than the writings of Homer? If suns, planets, and
satellites, with all their possibilities of life, changes of flora
and fauna, could be all provided for, as some scientists tell us,
in the fiery star-dust of a cloud, why may not the same Author
provide a perpetually widening river of life in his Word? As we
believe He is perpetually present in his worlds, we know He has
[Page 232] promised to be perpetually present in his Word, making it
alive with spirit and life.

The wise men of the past could not avoid alluding to ideas the falsity
of which subsequent discovery has revealed; but the writers of the
Bible did avoid such erroneous allusion. Of course they referred
to some things, as sunrise and sunset, according to appearance;
but our most scientific books do the same to-day. That the Bible
could avoid teaching the opposite of scientific truth proclaims
that a higher than human wisdom was in its teaching.

That negative argument is strong, but the affirmative argument is
much stronger. The Bible declares scientific truth far in advance
of its discovery, far in advance of man's ability to understand
its plain declarations. Take a few conspicuous illustrations:

The Bible asserted from the first that the present order of things
had a beginning. After ages of investigation, after researches in
the realms of physics, arguments in metaphysics, and conclusions
by the necessities of resistless logic, science has reached the
same result.

The Bible asserted from the first that creation of matter preceded
arrangement. It was chaos--void--without form--darkness; arrangement
was a subsequent work. The world was not created in the form it
was to have; it was to be moulded, shaped, stratified, coaled,
mountained, valleyed, subsequently. All of which science utters
ages afterward.

The Bible did not hesitate to affirm that light existed before
the sun, though men did not believe it, and used it as a weapon
against inspiration. Now we praise men for having demonstrated
the oldest record.

[Page 233]
It is a recently discovered truth of science that the trata of
the earth were formed by the action of water, and the mountains
were once under the ocean. It is an idea long familiar to Bible
readers: "Thou coverest the earth with the deep as with a garment.
The waters stood above the mountains. At thy rebuke they fled; at
the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. The mountains ascend;
the valleys descend into the place thou hast founded for them."
Here is a whole volume of geology in a paragraph. The thunder of
continental convulsions is God's voice; the mountains rise by God's
