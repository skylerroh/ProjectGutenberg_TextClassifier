THE HATED

By PAUL FLEHR


 _After space, there was always
 one more river to cross ... the
 far side of hatred and murder!_

The bar didn't have a name. No name of any kind. Not even an indication
that it had ever had one. All it said on the outside was:

       Cafe
        EAT
    _Cocktails_

which doesn't make a lot of sense. But it was a bar. It had a big TV set
going ya-ta-ta ya-ta-ta in three glorious colors, and a jukebox that
tried to drown out the TV with that lousy music they play. Anyway, it
wasn't a kid hangout. I kind of like it. But I wasn't supposed to be
there at all; it's in the contract. I was supposed to stay in New York
and the New England states.

Cafe-EAT-_Cocktails_ was right across the river. I think the name of the

forget to mix them. I got pretty loaded long before I left New York. I
realize that. I guess I had to get pretty loaded to risk the pension and
all.

Used to be I didn't drink much, but now, I don't know, when I have one
drink, I get to thinking about Sam and Wally and Chowderhead and Gilvey
and the captain. If I don't drink, I think about them, too, and then I
take a drink. And that leads to another drink, and it all comes out to
the same thing. Well, I guess I said it already, I drink a pretty good
amount, but you can't blame me.

There was a girl.

I always get a girl someplace. Usually they aren't much and this one
wasn't either. I mean she was probably somebody's mother. She was around
thirty-five and not so bad, though she had a long scar under her ear
down along her throat to the little round spot where her larynx was. It
