THE RETURN OF THE SWALLOWS


  "Out in the meadows the young grass springs,
    Shivering with sap," said the larks, "and we
  Shoot into air with our strong young wings,
    Spirally up over level and lea;
  Come, O Swallows, and fly with us
  Now that horizons are luminous!
    Evening and morning the world of light,
    Spreading and kindling, is infinite!"

  Far away, by the sea in the south,
    The hills of olive and slopes of fern
  Whiten and glow in the sun's long drouth,
    Under the heavens that beam and burn;
  And all the swallows were gather'd there
  Flitting about in the fragrant air,
    And heard no sound from the larks, but flew
    Flashing under the blinding blue.

  Out of the depths of their soft rich throats
    Languidly fluted the thrushes, and said:
  "Musical thought in the mild air floats,
    Spring is coming and winter is dead!
  Come, O Swallows, and stir the air,
  For the buds are all bursting unaware,
    And the drooping eaves and the elm-trees long
    To hear the sound of your low sweet song."

  Over the roofs of the white Algiers,
    Flashingly shadowing the bright bazaar,
  Flitted the swallows, and not one hears
    The call of the thrushes from far, from far;
  Sigh'd the thrushes; then, all at once,
  Broke out singing the old sweet tones,
    Singing the bridal of sap and shoot,
    The tree's slow life between root and fruit.

  But just when the dingles of April flowers
    Shine with the earliest daffodils,
  When, before sunrise, the cold clear hours
    Gleam with a promise that noon fulfils,--
  Deep in the leafage the cuckoo cried,
  Perch'd on a spray by a rivulet-side,
    "Swallows, O Swallows, come back again
    To swoop and herald the April rain."

  And something awoke in the slumbering heart
    Of the alien birds in their African air,
  And they paused, and alighted, and twitter'd apart,
    And met in the broad white dreamy square;
  And the sad slave-woman, who lifted up
  From the fountain her broad-lipp'd earthen cup,
  Said to herself, with a weary sigh,
  "To-morrow the swallows will northward fly!"

BARBARA FRIETCHIE


  Up from the meadows rich with corn,
  Clear in the cool September morn,

  The clustered spires of Frederick stand
  Green walled by the hills of Maryland.

  Round about them orchards sweep,                                     5
  Apple-and peach-tree fruited deep,--

  Fair as a garden of the Lord
  To the eye of the famished rebel horde,

  On that pleasant morn of the early fall
  When Lee march'd over the mountain-wall,--                          10

  Over the mountains winding down,
  Horse and foot, into Frederick town.

  Forty flags with their silver stars,
  Forty flags with their crimson bars,

  Flapped in the morning wind: the sun                                15
  Of noon looked down, and saw not one.

  Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,
  Bowed with her fourscore years and ten;

  Bravest of all in Frederick town,
  She took up the flag the men hauled down;                           20

  In her attic window the staff she set,
  To show that one heart was loyal yet.

  Up the street came the rebel tread,
  Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.

  Under his slouched hat left and right                               25
  He glanced; the old flag met his sight.

  "Halt!"--the dust-brown ranks stood fast.
  "Fire!"--out blazed the rifle-blast.

  It shivered the window, pane and sash;
  It rent the banner with seam and gash.                              30

  Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff
  Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf;

  She leaned far out on the window-sill,
  And shook it forth with a royal will.

  "Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,                            35
  But spare your country's flag!" she said.

  A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,
  Over the face of the leader came;

  The nobler nature within him stirred
  To life at that woman's deed and word:                              40

  "Who touches a hair of yon gray head,
  Dies like a dog! March on!" he said.

  All day long through Frederick street
  Sounded the tread of marching feet:

  All day long that free flag tossed                                  45
  Over the heads of the rebel host.

  Ever its torn folds rose and fell
  On the loyal winds that loved it well;

  And, through the hill-gaps, sunset light
  Shone over it with a warm good-night.                               50

  Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er,
  And the Rebel rides on his raids no more.

  Honour to her! and let a tear
  Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall's bier.

  Over Barbara Frietchie's grave,                                     55
  Flag of Freedom and Union wave!

  Peace and order and beauty draw
  Round thy symbol of light and law;

  And ever the stars above look down
  On thy stars below in Frederick town!                               60

BLESS THE LORD, O MY SOUL

Psalm ciii


  Bless the Lord, O my soul:
    And all that is within me, bless his holy name
  Bless the Lord, O my soul,
    And forget not all his benefits:
  Who forgiveth all thine iniquities;
    Who healeth all thy diseases;
  Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;
    Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies:
  Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things;
    So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.

  The Lord executeth righteousness
    And judgment for all that are oppressed.
  He made known his ways unto Moses,
    His acts unto the children of Israel.
  The Lord is merciful and gracious,
    Slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
  He will not always chide:
    Neither will he keep his anger for ever.
  He hath not dealt with us after our sins;
    Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.

  For as the heaven is high above the earth,
    So great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
  As far as the east is from the west,
    So far hath he removed our transgressions from us
  Like as a father pitieth his children,
    So the Lord pitieth them that fear him.
  For he knoweth our frame;
    He remembereth that we are dust.

  As for man, his days are as grass:
    As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
  For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;
    And the place thereof shall know it no more.
  But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting
       upon them that fear him,
    And his righteousness unto children's children;
  To such as keep his covenant,
    And to those that remember his commandments to do them.

  The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens;
    And his kingdom ruleth over all.
  Bless the Lord, ye his angels,
    That excel in strength,
  That do his commandments,
    Hearkening unto the voice of his word.
  Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts;
    Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
  Bless the Lord, all his works,
    In all places of his dominion:
  Bless the Lord, O my soul.

THE ETERNAL GOODNESS


  I know not what the future hath
  Of marvel or surprise,
  Assured alone that life and death
  His mercy underlies.

  And if my heart and flesh are weak                                   5
  To bear an untried pain,
  The bruised reed He will not break,
  But strengthen and sustain.

  No offering of my own I have,
  Nor works my faith to prove;                                        10
  I can but give the gifts He gave,
  And plead His love for love.

  And so beside the Silent Sea
  I wait the muffled oar;
  No harm from Him can come to me                                     15
  On ocean or on shore.

  I know not where His islands lift
  Their fronded palms in air;
  I only know I cannot drift
  Beyond His love and care.                                           20

THE KING OF GLORY

Psalm xxiv

(Anthems for the Inauguration of Jerusalem)


_I.--At the Foot of the Hill_

FIRST CHOIR

  The earth is the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof;
    The world, and they that dwell therein.
  For He hath founded it upon the seas,
    And established it upon the floods.
  Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD?
    And who shall stand in His holy place?


SECOND CHOIR

  He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart;
    Who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity,
    And hath not sworn deceitfully.
  He shall receive a blessing from the LORD,
    And righteousness from the God of his salvation.
  This is the generation of them that seek after Him,
    That seek Thy face, O God of Jacob.


_II.--Before the Gates_

FIRST CHOIR

  Lift up your heads, O ye gates;
    And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors:
    And the King of Glory shall come in.


SECOND CHOIR

  Who is the King of Glory?
