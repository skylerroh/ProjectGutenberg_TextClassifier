Chickamaugans embraced the more vicious and bloodthirsty Cherokees, with
a mixture of Creeks and bad whites, who, driven from every law-abiding
community, had cast in their lot with this tribe. The exact number of
white thieves and murderers who had found harbor in the Indian towns
during a score or more of years is not known; but the letters of the
Indian agents, preserved in the records, would indicate that there were
a good many of them. They were fit allies for Dragging Canoe; their
hatred of those from whom their own degeneracy had separated them was
not less than his.

In July, 1776, John Sevier wrote to the Virginia Committee as follows:

Dear Gentlemen: Isaac Thomas, William Falling, Jaret Williams and one
more have this moment come in by making their escape from the Indians
and say six 174 hundred Indians and whites were to start for this fort
and intend to drive the country up to New River before they return.

Thus was heralded the beginning of a savage warfare which kept the
borderers engaged for years.

It has been a tradition of the chroniclers that Isaac Thomas received
a timely warning from Nancy Ward, a half-caste Cherokee prophetess who
often showed her good will towards the whites; and that the Indians
were roused to battle by Alexander Cameron and John Stuart, the British
agents or superintendents among the overhill tribes. There was a letter
bearing Cameron's name stating that fifteen hundred savages from the
Cherokee and Creek nations were to join with British troops landed at
Pensacola in an expedition against the southern frontier colonies.
This letter was brought to Watauga at dead of night by a masked man who
slipped it through a window and rode away. Apparently John Sevier
did not believe the military information contained in the mysterious
missive, for he communicated nothing of it to the Virginia Committee.
In recent years the facts have come to light. This mysterious letter
and others of a similar tenor bearing forged signatures are cited in
a report by the British Agent, John Stuart, to 175 his Government. It
appears that such inflammatory missives had been industriously scattered
through the back settlements of both Carolinas. There are also letters
from Stuart to Lord Dartmouth, dated a year earlier, urging that
something be done immediately to counteract rumors set afloat that the
British were endeavoring to instigate both the Indians and the negroes
to attack the Americans.

Now it is, of course, an established fact that both the British and the
American armies used Indians in the War of Independence, even as both
together had used them against the French and the Spanish and their
allied Indians. It was inevitable that the Indians should participate
in any severe conflict between the whites. They were a numerous and a
warlike people and, from their point of view, they had more at stake
than the alien whites who were contesting for control of the red man's
continent. Both British and Americans have been blamed for half-hearted
attempts to keep the Indians neutral. The truth is that each side
strove to enlist the Indians--to be used, if needed later, as
warriors. Massacre was no part of this policy, though it may have been
countenanced by individual officers in both camps. But it is obvious 176
that, once the Indians took the warpath, they were to be restrained by
no power and, no matter under whose nominal command, they would carry on
warfare by their own methods.¹

¹ There is little doubt that either side, British or Americans, stood
ready to enlist the Indians. Already before Boston the Americans had
had the help of the Stockbridge tribe. Washington found the service
committed to the practise when he arrived at Cambridge early in July.
Dunmore had taken the initiative in securing such allies, at least
is purpose; but the insurgent Virginians had had of late more direct
contact with the tribes and were now striving to secure them but with
little success. _The Westward Movement,_ by Justin Winsor, p. 87.
General Ethan Allen of Vermont, as his letters show, sent emissaries
into Canada in an endeavor to enlist the French Canadians and the
Canadian Indians against the British in Canada. See _American Archives,_
Fourth Series, vol. II, p. 714. The British General Gage wrote to Lord
Dartmouth from Boston, June 12, 1775: We need not be tender of calling
on the Savages as the rebels have shown us the example, by bringing as
many Indians down against us as they could collect. _American Archives,_
Fourth Series, vol. ii, p. 967. In a letter to Lord Germain, dated
August 23, 1776, John Stuart wrote: Although Mr. Cameron was in constant
danger of assassination and the Indians were threatened with invasion
should they dare to protect him, yet he still found means to prevent
their falling on the settlement. See North Carolina _Colonial Records,_
vol. X, pp. 608 and 763. Proof that the British agents had succeeded
in keeping the Cherokee neutral till the summer of 1776 is found in the
instructions, dated the 7th of July, to Major Winston from President
Rutledge of South Carolina, regarding the Cherokees, that they must be
forced to give up the British agents and instead of remaining in a State
of Neutrality with respect to British Forces they must take part with
us against them. See North Carolina _Colonial Records,_ vol. X, p. 658.
Whatever may have been the case elsewhere, the attacks on the Watauga
and Holston settlements 177 were not instigated by British agents. It
was not Nancy Ward but Henry Stuart, John Stuart's deputy, who sent
Isaac Thomas to warn the settlers. In their efforts to keep the
friendship of the red men, the British and the Americans were providing
them with powder and lead. The Indians had run short of ammunition and,
since hunting was their only means of livelihood, they must shoot or
starve. South Carolina sent the Cherokees a large supply of powder and
lead which was captured en route by Tories. About the same time Henry
Stuart set out from Pensacola with another consignment from the British.
His report to Lord Germain of his arrival in the Chickamaugan towns
and of what took place there just prior to the raids on the Tennessee
settlements is one of the most illuminating as well as one of the most
dramatic papers in the collected records of that time.¹

¹ North Carolina _Colonial Records,_ vol. X, pp. 763-785. Stuart's first
act was secretly to send out Thomas, the trader, to warn the settlers
of their peril, for a small war party of braves was even then concluding
the preliminary war ceremonies. The reason for this Indian alarm and
projected excursion was the fact that the settlers had built one fort at
least on the Indian lands. Stuart finally persuaded the 178 Indians
to remain at peace until he could write to the settlers stating the
grievances and asking for negotiations. The letters were to be carried
by Thomas on his return.

But no sooner was Thomas on his way again with the letters than there
arrived a deputation of warriors from the Northern tribes--from the
Confederate nations, the Mohawks, Ottawas, Nantucas, Shawanoes and
Delawares--fourteen men in all, who entered the council hall of the Old
Beloved Town of Chota with their faces painted black and the war belt
carried before them. They said that they had been seventy days on their
journey. Everywhere along their way they had seen houses and forts
springing up like weeds across the green sod of their hunting lands.
Where once were great herds of deer and buffalo, they had watched
thousands of men at arms preparing for war. So many now were the white
warriors and their women and children that the red men had been obliged
to travel a great way on the other side of the Ohio and to make a detour
of nearly three hundred miles to avoid being seen. Even on this outlying
route they had crossed the fresh tracks of a great body of people with
horses and cattle going still further towards the setting sun. But their
179 cries were not to be in vain; for their fathers, the French had
heard them and had promised to aid them if they would now strike as one
for their lands.

After this preamble the deputy of the Mohawks rose. He said that some
American people had made war on one of their towns and had seized the
son of their Great Beloved Man, Sir William Johnson, imprisoned him, and
put him to a cruel death; this crime demanded a great vengeance and they
would not cease until they had taken it. One after another the fourteen
delegates rose and made their talks and presented their wampum strings
to Dragging Canoe. The last to speak was a chief of the Shawanoes. He
also declared that their fathers, the French, who had been so long dead,
were alive again, that they had supplied them plentifully with arms and
ammunition and had promised to assist them in driving out the Americans
and in reclaiming their country. Now all the Northern tribes were joined
in one for this great purpose; and they themselves were on their way to
all the Southern tribes and had resolved that, if any tribe refused
to join, they would fall upon and extirpate that tribe, after having
overcome the whites. At the conclusion of his oration the Shawanoe
presented the war belt--nine feet of six-inch wide 180 purple wampum
spattered with vermilion--to Dragging Canoe, who held it extended
between his two hands, in silence, and waited. Presently rose a headman
whose wife had been a member of Sir William Johnson's household. He laid
his hand on the belt and sang the war song. One by one, then, chiefs
and warriors rose, laid hold of the great belt and chanted the war
song. Only the older men, made wise by many defeats, sat still in their
places, mute and dejected. After that day every young fellow's face in
the overhills towns appeared blackened and nothing was now talked of but
war.

Stuart reports that all the white men in the tribe also laid hands on
the belt. Dragging Canoe then demanded that Cameron and Stuart come
forward and take hold of the war belt--which we refused. Despite the
offense their refusal gave--and it would seem a dangerous time to give
such offense--Cameron delivered a strong talk for peace, warning
the Cherokees of what must surely be the end of the rashness they
contemplated. Stuart informed the chief that if the Indians persisted in
attacking the settlements with out waiting for answers to his letters,
he would not remain with them any longer or bring them any more
ammunition. He went to his house and 181 made ready to leave on the
following day. Early the next morning Dragging Canoe appeared at his
door and told him that the Indians were now very angry about the letters
he had written, which could only have put the settlers on their guard;
and that if any white man attempted to leave the nation they had
determined to follow him but not to bring him back. Dragging Canoe had
painted his face black to carry this message. Thomas now returned with
an answer from the West Fincastle men, which was so unsatisfactory to
the tribe that war ceremonies were immediately begun. Stuart and Cameron
could no longer influence the Indians. All that could now be done was to
give them strict charge not to pass the Boundary Line, not to injure any
of the King's faithful subjects, not to Kill any women and children; and
to threaten to stop all ammunition if they did not obey these orders.

The major part of the Watauga militia went out to meet the Indians and
defeated a large advance force at Long Island Flats on the Holston. The
Watauga fort, where many of the settlers had taken refuge, contained
forty fighting men under Robertson and Sevier. As Indians usually
retreated and 182 waited for a while after a defeat, those within the
fort took it for granted that no immediate attack was to be expected;
and the women went out at daybreak into the fields to milk the cows.
Suddenly the war whoop shrilled from the edge of the clearing. Red
warriors leaped from the green skirting of the forest. The women ran for
the fort. Quickly the heavy gates swung to and the dropped bar secured
them. Only then did the watchmen discover that one woman had been shut
out. She was a young woman nearing her twenties and, if legend has
reported her truly, Bonnie Kate Sherrill was a beauty. Through a
porthole Sevier saw her running towards the shut gates, dodging and
darting, her brown hair blowing from the wind of her race for life--and
offering far too rich a prize to the yelling fiends who dashed after
her. Sevier coolly shot the foremost of her pursuers, then sprang upon
the wall, caught up Bonnie Kate, and tossed her inside to safety. And
legend says further that when, after Sevier's brief widowerhood, she
became his wife, four years later, Bonnie Kate was wont to say that she
would be willing to run another such race any day to have another such
introduction!

There were no casualties within the fort and, 183 after three hours, the
foe withdrew, leaving several of their warriors slain.

In the excursions against the Indians which followed this opening of
hostilities Sevier won his first fame as an Indian fighter--the fame
later crystallized in the phrase thirty-five battles, thirty-five
victories. His method was to take a very small company of the hardiest
and swiftest horsemen--men who could keep their seat and endurance, and
horses that could keep their feet and their speed, on any steep of the
mountains no matter how tangled and rough the going might be--swoop down
upon war camp, or town, and go through it with rifle and hatchet and
fire, then dash homeward at the same pace before the enemy had begun to
consider whether to follow him or not. In all his thirty-five battles it
is said he lost not more than fifty men.

The Cherokees made peace in 1777, after about a year of almost
continuous warfare, the treaty being concluded on their side by the old
chiefs who had never countenanced the war. Dragging Canoe refused to
take part, but he was rendered innocuous for the time being by the
destruction of several of the Chickamaugan villages. James Robertson
now went to Chota as Indian agent for North Carolina. 184 So fast was
population growing, owing to the opening of a wagon road into Burke
County, North Carolina, that Washington County was divided. John Sevier
became Colonel of Washington and Isaac Shelby Colonel of the newly
erected Sullivan County. Jonesborough, the oldest town in Tennessee, was
laid out as the county seat of Washington; and in the same year (1778)
Sevier moved to the bank of the Nolichucky River, so-called after
the Indian name of this dashing sparkling stream, meaning rapid or
precipitous. Thus the nickname given John Sevier by his devotees had a
dual application. He was well called Nolichucky Jack.

When Virginia annulled Richard Henderson's immense purchase but allowed
him a large tract on the Cumberland, she by no means discouraged that
intrepid pioneer. Henderson's tenure of Kentucky had been brief, but not
unprofitable in experience. He had learned that colonies must be
treated with less commercial pressure and with more regard to individual
liberty, if they were to be held loyal either to a King beyond the water
or to an uncrowned leader nearer at hand. He had been making his plans
for colonization of that portion of the Transylvania purchase which
lay within the 185 bounds of North Carolina along the Cumberland and
choosing his men to lay the foundations of his projected settlement
in what was then a wholly uninhabited country; and he had decided on
generous terms, such as ten dollars a thousand acres for land, the
certificate of purchase to entitle the holder to further proceedings in
the land office without extra fees.

To head an enterprise of such danger and hardship Henderson required
a man of more than mere courage; a man of resource, of stability, of
proven powers, one whom other men would follow and obey with confidence.
So it was that James Robertson was chosen to lead the first white
settlers into middle Tennessee. He set out in February, 1779,
accompanied by his brother, Mark Robertson, several other white men, and
a negro, to select a site for settlement and to plant corn. Meanwhile
another small party led by Gaspar Mansker had arrived. As the boundary
line between Virginia and North Carolina had not been run to this point,
Robertson believed that the site he had chosen lay within Virginia
and was in the disposal of General Clark. To protect the settlers,
therefore, he journeyed into the Illinois country to purchase cabin
rights from Clark, but there he was evidently 186 convinced that the
site on the Cumberland would be found to lie within North Carolina. He
returned to Watauga to lead a party of settlers into the new territory,
towards which they set out in October. After crossing the mountain chain
through Cumberland Gap, the party followed Boone's road--the Warriors'
Path--for some distance and then made their own trail southwestward
through the wilderness to the bluffs on the Cumberland, where they built
cabins to house them against one of the coldest winters ever experienced
in that county. So were laid the first foundations of the present city
of Nashville, at first named Nashborough by Robertson.¹ On the way,
Robertson had fallen in with a party of men and families bound for
Kentucky and had persuaded them to accompany his little band to the
Cumberland. Robertson's own wife and children, as well as the families
of his party, had been left to follow in the second expedition, which
was to be made by water under the command of Captain John Donelson.

¹ In honor of General Francis Nash, of North Carolina, who was mortally
wounded at Germantown, 1777. The little fleet of boats containing the
settlers, their families, and all their household goods, was to start
from Fort Patrick Henry, near Long Island 187 in the Holston River, to
float down into the Tennessee and along the 652 miles of that widely
wandering stream to the Ohio, and then to proceed up the Ohio to the
mouth of the Cumberland and up the Cumberland until Robertson's station
should appear--a journey, as it turned out, of some nine hundred miles
through unknown country and on waters at any rate for the greater part
never before navigated by white men.

_Journal of a voyage, intended by God's permission, in the good boat
Adventure_ is the title of the log book in which Captain Donelson
entered the events of the four months' journey. Only a few pages endured
to be put into print: but those few tell a tale of hazard and courage
that seems complete. Could a lengthier narrative, even if enriched with
literary art and fancy, bring before us more vividly than do the simple
entries of Donelson's log the spirit of the men and the women who won
the West? If so little personal detail is recorded of the pioneer men of
that day that we must deduce what they were from what they did, what do
we know of their unfailing comrades, the pioneer women? Only that they
were there and that they shared in every test of courage and endurance,
save the march of troops and the hunt. 188 Donelson's _Journal_
therefore has a special value, because in its terse account of Mrs.
Jennings and Mrs. Peyton it depicts unforgettably the quality of pioneer
womanhood.¹

¹ This Journal is printed in Ramsey's _Annals of Tennessee._ _December
22nd, 1779._ Took our departure from the fort and fell down the river to
the mouth of Reedy Creek where we were stopped by the fall of water and
most excessive hard frost.

Perhaps part of the _Journal_ was lost, or perhaps the excessive hard
frost of that severe winter, when it is said even droves of wild game
perished, prevented the boats from going on, for the next entry is dated
the 27th of February. On this date the _Adventure_ and two other boats
grounded and lay on the shoals all that afternoon and the succeeding
night in much distress.
