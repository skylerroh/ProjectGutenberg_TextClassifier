know of you, that you will exercise no undue harshness, but will act
with tact and discretion, as well as firmness."

"I will try to do so, your Excellency. I feel that it is a heavy
responsibility and will spare no pains to justify the unmerited honour
that has been bestowed upon me."

"You have seen that the taking in of stores is complete, and that
nothing is wanting for the voyage?"

"Yes, sir. I stood by while the overseer of stores checked off every
sack and barrel as it came on board. The water is to be brought off this
evening, and as I was unable to be present, Sir Ralph Harcourt is there
to count the barrels and see that all are full."

"Goodbye, Sir Gervaise," the grand master said, as the interview
terminated.

"Hitherto you have given me, from the time you reached the Island,
naught but reason for satisfaction at my nomination of you as page,
and I have no fear that you will fail this time. Remember that valour,
however great, cannot prevail against overpowering odds. You had a
lesson of that when you served under Ricord, though finally the affair
turned out well. I do not say, don't attempt desperate undertakings, but
don't attempt impossible ones. Be careful of the lives of your knights.
Remember that ere long every sword may be of the utmost consequence in
the defence of Rhodes, and that even the capture of pirates may be too
dearly purchased; but that, at the same time, the honour of the flag
of the Order must be upheld at all hazards. Ah!" he broke off, seeing
a slight smile on the young knight's face, "you think my orders
contradictory? It may be so; but you know what I mean, and I fear not
that you will blunder in carrying them out. Be prudent, and yet not
over prudent. I mean, be not rash, unless there are such benefits to be
obtained as would justify great risk in obtaining them."

On returning to the auberge, Gervaise had a long chat with Ralph.

"I think the admiral's talk with us this afternoon had an excellent
effect, Gervaise. I do not say that every one was not before disposed
to obey you in all things, willingly and cheerfully; but he put it so
strongly to them that they had volunteered specially for service in this
galley, knowing well who was to be its commander, and the circumstance
that the crew was to consist solely of young knights, and had therefore
specially pledged their honour so to act that the enterprise should be
in all respects a successful one. To render it so, obedience was even
a greater necessity than valour. This was the most important of all the
vows taken by the knights of the Order, and it was only by the strictest
and most unquestioning obedience on the part of all to the orders of
their superiors, that the work of a vast community could be carried
on. Passing over the fact that you were their superior in rank, both as
being a secular knight and a knight commander of the Order, you had
been specially appointed by the grand master and council, as well as
by himself, and that they bestowed upon you while at sea, and in
the absence of any officers of superior rank, their full powers and
authority. You were, in fact, their representative and agent, and
therefore to be regarded with the same deference and respect that would
be due to the oldest knight similarly placed. 'Lastly,' he said, in a
less serious tone, 'you must remember that this is an experiment, and,
as some think, a somewhat rash one. Never before did a galley, manned
entirely from among the youngest of our knights, put to sea; and you may
be sure that, unless successful, the experiment is not likely to be ever
repeated. You have been selected from among many other candidates, and
you have not only to justify the choice, but to uphold the reputation
and honour of the young knights of your Order, by all of whom your
doings will be regarded with special interest, as reflecting credit not
only upon yourselves individually, but as representatives and champions
of them all.'

"I could see that his words had a great effect. He had placed me beside
him, and I marked their faces as he spoke. Each face lit up at his
appeal, and I do not think there was one but silently registered a vow
to do all in his power to prove himself worthy of the confidence placed
in him and his companions by the grand master and admiral. I had before
no shadow of fear that everything would not go well. I knew almost all
of them personally, and if I myself had had the selection from among
the whole body of knights in the convent, I could not have made a choice
that would have suited me better. It seems to me that in each auberge
the bailiff has endeavoured to pick out the seven young knights whom he
considered would most worthily support the honour of the langue. Still,
confident as I was before, I feel more so now, after the admiral's
address to us."

"I had no fear either, Ralph, though doubtless the admiral's words
will carry great weight with them. It was thoughtlessness rather than
anything else that I dreaded; but now that the admiral himself has
spoken to them, there is no fear that anything will occur to give us
trouble. I have particularly noticed that when we have been on board,
and have been laughing and chatting together before we got under way,
their manner changed directly the first order was given, and that all
the commands were carried out with as much goodwill and alacrity as if
they were under Ricord himself."

On the following morning the knights all went on board the Santa
Barbara. Their baggage was carried down by slaves, and by the personal
servants from each auberge who were to go as their attendants during
the voyage. The grand master had advanced Gervaise a sum equal to half a
year's income of his commandery, and with this he had purchased a stock
of the best wines, and various other luxuries, to supplement the rations
supplied from the funds of the Order to knights when at sea. Gervaise
had to go round early to the admiral to sign the receipt for stores and
to receive his final orders in writing. All were, therefore, on board
before him and, when he arrived, were drawn up in military order to
receive him.

Every knight was in full armour, and as, at a word from Ralph, they
drew their swords and saluted the young commander, Gervaise felt with a
thrill of pleasure and of confidence that with such a following he
need not fear any encounter with a pirate force, unless in overwhelming
numbers.

The young knights were all, with the exception only of Ralph Harcourt,
between the ages of seventeen and nineteen, and their young faces, free
in most cases even from the suspicion of a moustache, looked almost
those of boys. But there was no mistaking the ardour and enthusiasm in
their faces, and the lack of breadth and weight, that years alone would
give to them, was compensated by skill in their weapons, acquired by
long and severe training, and by the activity and tireless energy of
youth.

"Knights and comrades," Gervaise said as, after walking through the
double line to the end of the poop he turned and faced them, "I am
proud indeed to command so gallant a body of knights. The success of our
expedition depends upon you rather than upon me, and as I feel assured
of your warm cooperation I have no fear as to what the result will be,
if Dame Fortune will but favour us by throwing in our way some of those
scourges of the sea in search of whom we are about to set out. Many of
us have already encountered them, and, fighting side by side with older
knights, have borne our share of the work, while those who have not done
so will, I am sure, do equally well when the opportunity arrives. We
shall not this voyage have the encouragement and confidence inspired by
the presence of those who have long and valiantly borne the standard of
the Order; but, on the other hand, we have to show that we are worthy
of the confidence reposed in us, and that the young knights of the Order
can be trusted to emulate the deeds of those who have rendered the name
of the Hospitallers a terror to the infidel."

A shout of approbation greeted the close of his address. Gervaise then
walked forward to the end of the poop, and looked down upon the slaves,
who, with their oars out, were awaiting the order to row.

"Men," he said in Turkish, "it is my desire that, while it is necessary
that you should do your work, your lot shall be no heavier than can be
avoided. You will not be taxed beyond your powers, save when the enemy
is in sight, or there is supreme need for haste, but then you must be
called upon for your utmost exertions. I wish your work to be willing.
I abhor the use of the lash, and so long as each man does his fair quota
of work, I have given the strictest orders that it shall never be used.
I have, at my own cost, made provision that your daily rations shall be
improved while under my command. Meat will be served out to you daily,
when it can be obtained, and for those of you who hold that the strict
tenets of your religion may be relaxed while engaged in such severe
labour, a ration of wine will also be served out; and such other
indulgences as are compatible with the discipline and safety of the
ship, will also be granted to you."

There was a murmur of gratitude among the slaves. Gervaise then gave the
order to row, and the galley started on her voyage. The knights had now
fallen out from their ranks, and were soon laughing and talking gaily.
Being all of noble families and knightly rank, there was, except when on
actual duty, a tone of perfect equality and good fellowship prevailing
among them. French was the common language, for as the Order was of
French foundation, and three of the seven langues belonged to that
country, most of the high dignitaries being chosen from their ranks,
it was natural that the French language should be the general medium of
communication between them.

Until noon the slaves rowed steadily and well. Work was then stopped,
for there was scarce a breath of wind stirring the water. Even under the
awning that had, as the sun gained power, been erected over the poop,
the heat was oppressive. The knights had all divested themselves of
their armour, and most of them retired below for a siesta. As soon as
the slaves stopped rowing, an awning, which Gervaise had purchased,
and which was rolled up under the break of the poop, was, to their
astonishment, drawn over them.

"Don't you think you are spoiling your slaves, Sir Gervaise?" one of the
Spanish knights asked doubtfully.

"On the contrary, Sir Pedro, I hope that I am improving them. You have
not worked as a galley slave, but I have, and I can assure you that I
used to feel the hours when we were lying broiling in the sun, doing
nothing, much more trying than those during which I was at work. I used
to be quite giddy and sick with the heat, and on getting out the
oars again had scarce strength to work them. But this is not the most
important point. In port the slaves always sleep in the prison, but at
sea they must rest on their benches; and to do so with clothes soaked
with the heavy dew must be a severe trial, and most prejudicial to the
health. The awning cost but a few ducats, and I reckon that, putting
aside the comfort to the slaves, it will be very speedily repaid by
their better health and capacity for labour. When away in the galley
with Sir Louis Ricord, I used to feel the greatest pity for the
unfortunate wretches when at daybreak, in their drenched clothes, and
shivering with cold and wet, they rose to commence their work. I then
took a vow that if ever I should come to command a galley I would
provide an awning for the slaves."

Two or three of the knights standing by expressed their warm approval
of what Gervaise said. There was, in those days, but little of that
sentiment of humanity that is now prevalent, and slaves were everywhere
regarded as mere beasts of burden rather than as human beings. When,
however, they had the question put to them, as Gervaise had done, they
were ready to give a hearty agreement, although it was the utilitarian
rather than the humanitarian side of the question that recommended it
to them. After three hours' rest the journey was renewed, and just
at nightfall the galley anchored off an islet lying to the north of
Carpathos.

While the servants were laying the tables along the poop for the
evening meal, Gervaise went down to see that his orders were carried out
regarding the food for the slaves. They were already eating their
bread and meat with an air of satisfaction that showed how warmly they
appreciated the unusual indulgence, while there were few indeed who did
not hold up their drinking horns as a servant passed along between the
benches with a skin of wine. Gervaise spoke to many of them.

"Ah, my lord," one of them said, "if we were always treated like this,
slavery would be endurable. For ten years have I rowed in Christian
galleys, but never before has an awning been spread to keep off the sun
or the dew. We shall not forget your kindness, my lord, and will row our
hardest right cheerfully when you call upon us for an effort."

There was a murmur of assent from the galley slaves around.

"May Allah be merciful to you, as you are merciful to us!" another slave
exclaimed. "The blessing of those whom you regard as infidels can at
least do you no harm."

"On the contrary, it can do me good," Gervaise said. "The God you
Moslems and we Christians worship is, I believe, the same, though under
another name."

Gervaise had, indeed, during his long conversations with Suleiman Ali,
often discussed with him the matter of his faith, and had come, in
consequence, to regard it in a very different light to that in which it
was viewed by his companions. There was faith in one God at the
bottom of both Mohammedanism and Christianity. The Mohammedans held
in reverence the lawgivers and prophets of the Old Testament, and even
regarded Christ Himself as being a prophet. They had been grievously led
away by Mahomet, whom Gervaise regarded as a false teacher; but as he
had seen innumerable instances of the fidelity of the Moslems to their
creed, and the punctuality and devotion with which the slaves said their
daily prayers, exposed though they were to the scorn and even the anger
of their taskmasters, he had quite lost, during his nine months
of constant association with Suleiman Ali, the bigoted hatred of
Mohammedanism so universal at the time. He regarded Moslems as foes to
be opposed to the death; but he felt that it was unfair to hate them for
being hostile to Christianity, of which they knew nothing.



CHAPTER XIII THE FIRST PRIZES


After leaving the slaves, Gervaise joined his companions on the poop.
They were engaged in an animated discussion as to whether it was
advisable to grant indulgences to slaves. The majority approved of the
steps Gervaise had taken, but some asserted that these concessions would
only lead them to look for more, and would create discontent among the
crews of other galleys not so favoured.

"Well, comrades," said Gervaise, "I think that so far I am better
qualified than any of you to give an opinion; but it may be that it will
fall to the lot of some of you to be a slave in Turkish hands. In that
case, I can affirm with certainty, that you will keenly appreciate any
alleviation, however small, of your lot. You must remember that the one
feeling of the slave is dull despair. Death is the only relief he has
to look forward to. Do you think that a man so feeling can do his best,
either at an oar or at any other kind of work? I am sure it would not be
so in my case. But if you brighten his life a little, and show him
that he is not regarded as merely a brute beast, and that you take some
interest in him, he will work in a different spirit. Even viewed from a
merely monetary point of view it must pay well to render him as content
as possible with his lot. You know how great is the mortality among the
slaves--how they pine away and die from no material malady that can be
detected, but simply from hopelessness and weariness of life, aided,
undoubtedly, in the case of the galley slaves, by sleeping in the damp
night air after an exposure all day to the full heat of the sun. This
brings an answer to your second objection. Undoubtedly it might cause
discontent among the slaves of other galleys when they hear that others
are treated better than themselves. But I hope that if, on our return,
we bring back all our slaves in good condition and health, the contrast
between their appearance and that of the slaves in most other galleys
will be so marked that the admiral may consider it would be well to
order awnings to be fixed to all the vessels of the Order, and even to
grant to all slaves, when away on voyages, the little indulgences I
have given them here. The expense would be very trifling, and it would
certainly add a great deal to the average life of a slave, and would
render him capable of better work. There is another advantage. If
the Turks learn that their countrymen in our hands are treated with a
certain amount of kindness and consideration, it might lead them to act
similarly to those of our Order who may be unfortunate enough to fall
into their hands."

"There is a great deal in what you say, Sir Gervaise," one of the
knights, who had before taken the opposite point of view, said. "There
is no reason why our galley should not be a model one, and though, like
enough, the seniors will laugh at our making innovations, D'Aubusson
is a reformer, and will certainly support anything that he sees to be
beneficial, from whatever quarter it comes."

Supper was now served, and the young knights were well pleased with the
entertainment provided for them. It was the principal meal of the day.
Their fast was broken by a glass of wine, a manchet of bread, and fruit
soon after rising. At eleven o'clock they sat down to a more substantial
meal; but in that climate the heat was at that hour considerable, and as
there were duties to be performed, there was no sitting long at table.
At supper the day's work was over, their appetite was sharpened by the
cool evening breeze, and the meal was hearty and prolonged. After it was
concluded, several of the knights brought up from below viols and other
instruments of music; for the ability to accompany the voice with such
an instrument was considered an essential part of the education of a
knight.

For some hours the songs and romances, so popular at the time, were sung
in the various languages represented on board; then the knights, one by
one, went down to their sleeping places, until only the seven knights of
the langue of Auvergne, who were to watch the first night, remained on
deck. Five of these wrapped themselves in their mantles and lay down on
the benches. One of the others descended to the waist, walked along the
plank between the lines of sleeping slaves, and took up his place in
the bow, while the other paced up and down the poop, the fall of
his footsteps being the only sound to break the silence that reigned
throughout the ship.

In the morning, as soon as the knights had all taken a plunge in the
sea, the oars were got out, and the galley proceeded on her way. Passing
through the islands and skirting the southern shore of Greece, she
continued her course west. Malta was sighted, but they did not put in
there. Pantellaria was passed, and in a fortnight after leaving Rhodes,
Cape Bon, at the entrance to the bay of Tunis, was sighted. Until Greece
was left behind them, the nights had generally been spent in small
ports, where supplies of fresh meat, fish, and fruit, were obtainable.
So far no incident had marked the voyage. The weather had continued
fine, and they had heard nothing, from ships they had fallen in with,
of any Moslem pirates having been seen. A few hours, however, after
sighting the coast of Africa, a dark object was seen ahead.

"It is a ship of some sort," Ralph said; "but her masts have gone. It
may be that she is a merchantman that has been captured and sacked by
the Moorish pirates."

Orders were given to the rowers to quicken their pace, and in little
over an hour they were alongside the hull. As soon as the vessels were
close enough for those on the poop of the galley to look down on to
the deck of the other craft, it was seen that Ralph's suppositions were
correct. Two bodies lay stretched upon it. One was crushed under the
fallen mast; the other lay huddled up in a heap, a cannon ball having
almost torn him asunder. The knights leapt on to the deck as soon as the
galley ran alongside. Gervaise made first for the man lying beneath the
mast; as he came up to him, the sailor opened his eyes and murmured,
"Water!" Gervaise called out to one of the servants to bring water from
the galley, and, as soon as it came, poured some between the man's lips,
and the knights by their united efforts lifted the mast from across his
body. It was evident, however, that he had but a short time to live,
and the dew of death was on his face. After a few minutes he rallied a
little, and looked gratefully at his rescuers.

"You have been attacked by pirates," Gervaise said. "Was there one
galley, or two?"

"Three galleys," the man replied in a faint whisper.

"Do you know where they were from?"

"Tripoli."

"How long ago?"

"It was about three hours after sunrise when we saw them coming up," the
man said, his voice gaining in strength, as some wine they gave him took
effect. "It was useless to fight, and I hauled down our flag, but in
spite of that one of the pirates fired a broadside, and one of the
shot hit the mast and brought it down, and I was crushed under it. They
boarded us, took off all the crew as captives, and emptied the hold; I
knew that I was done for, and begged them to kill me; but they paid
no attention. I know a little of their language, and as I lay there I
caught something of what they were saying; they are bound for the Island
of Sardinia, where they have a rendezvous, and are to join a great
gathering of their consorts. I don't know the name of the place, but it
is on the east coast. More water!"

Gervaise knelt to pour some water between his lips, when he gave a
sudden cry, a shudder ran through his frame, and he was dead.

"Let us return on board, gentlemen," Gervaise said, rising to his feet.
"We can do nothing here."

As soon as he regained the deck of the galley, he signed to Ralph to
follow him below.

"Now, Ralph," he said, "this is one of those cases in which we have to
decide whether we ought or ought not to be prudent. From what that poor
fellow said, the pirates have about five hours' start of us, and as they
can have no idea that they are pursued, we can doubtless overtake them
before they reach Sardinia. The question is, ought we to pursue them at
once, or ought we to coast along until we find Visconti's galley? Three
of these Tripoli pirates, crowded as they always are with men, would
prove serious opponents, yet we might engage them with a fair hope of
victory. But we may be seriously disabled in the fight, and should be,
perhaps, unable to carry the news to Genoa that there are many pirate
ships gathering on the coast of Sardinia to prey upon their commerce."

"We might be days, or even weeks, before we light upon Visconti's
galley, Gervaise, and even when we found it, he might not consider
himself justified in leaving the coast where he is stationed. Besides,
while we are spending our time looking for him, the pirates will be
committing terrible depredations. It must be a big expedition, under
some notorious pirate, or they would never venture so far north."

"Then you think that I should be justified in pursuing them alone. It is
a fearful responsibility to have to decide."

"I think so, Gervaise. There is no saying what misfortunes might happen
if we did not venture to do so."

"Very well then, so be it. But before deciding finally on so grave a
matter, I will lay it before the company."

"There is no doubt as to what their decision will be," Ralph said, with
a smile.

"Perhaps not, Ralph; but as they will be called upon to risk their lives
in a dangerous enterprise, it is as well that they should have a say in
the matter."

When they returned on to the poop, there was an expression of eagerness
and excitement on the faces of the young knights which showed how
anxiously they had been awaiting the result of the conference below.
Gervaise stepped on to a bench, and motioned to them to close up round
him.

"Comrades," he said, "although the responsibility of whatever course may
be taken must rest upon my shoulders, yet I think it but right that,
as a general before a battle often calls a council of war to assist him
with its advice, so I should lay before you the two courses open to us,
and ask your opinion upon them. Sir Ralph Harcourt and I are of one mind
in the matter, but as the decision is a grave one we should be loath to
act upon it without your concurrence."

He then repeated the alternatives as he had laid them before Ralph.
"Now," he went on, "as you see, there is grave danger, and much risk
in the one course; but if successful its advantages are obvious. On
the other hand, the second plan is more sure, more prudent, and more in
accordance with the instructions I have received. I ask you to let me
know frankly your opinion on the subject. If your view agrees with ours,
although it will not relieve me from the responsibility of deciding,
it will at least, in the event of things turning out badly, be a
satisfaction to know that the course had your approval, and that it was
your desire, as well as ours, that we should undertake it. First, then,
let all who are in favour of following the pirates go to the starboard
side of the deck, while those who are in favour of joining Visconti, and
laying this serious matter we have discovered before him, move to the
larboard side."

There was a rush of the knights to the right, and not one moved to the
other side.

"Your decision is the same as ours," Gervaise said. "To the north, then!
If there is great peril in the adventure, there is also great honour to
be gained."

The knights gave a shout of satisfaction at finding that their choice
was also that of the officers.
