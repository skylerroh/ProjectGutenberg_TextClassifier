Hail, holy Joseph, hail!
Teach us our flesh to tame,
And, Mary, keep the hearts
That love thy husband's name.
Mother of Jesus! bless,
And bless, ye saints on high,
All meek and simple souls
That to Saint Joseph cry.

1.
Hail, glorious Saint Patrick! dear Saint of our isle,
On us thy poor children bestow a sweet smile;
And now thou art high in the mansions above,
On Erin's green valleys look down in love.

2.
Hail, glorious Saint Patrick! Thy words were once strong
Against Satan's wiles and a heretic throng;
Not less is thy might where in Heaven thou art;
Oh, come to our aid, in our battle take part!

3.
In the war against sin, in the fight for faith,
Dear Saint, may thy children resist to the death;
May their strength be in meekness, in penance, and pray'r,
Their banner the Cross, which they glory to bear.

4.
Thy people, now exiles on many a shore,
Shall love and revere thee till time be no more;
And the fire thou hast kindled shall ever burn bright,
Its warmth undiminished, undying its light.

5.
Ever bless and defend the sweet land of our birth,
Where the shamrock still blooms as when thou wert on earth,
And our hearts shall yet burn, wheresoever we roam,
For God and Saint Patrick and our native home.

Seek ye a Patron to defend?
Si vis Patronum quaerere

Translated by Father Caswall
Nicola A. Montani


1.
Seek ye a patron to defend
Your cause? then, one and all,
Without delay upon the Prince
Of the Apostles call.

Refrain
Blest holder of the heav'nly Keys!
Thy pray'rs we all implore;
Unlock to us the sacred bars
Of Heav'n's eternal door.

2.
By penitential tears thou didst
The path of life regain:
Teach us with thee to weep our sins
And wash away their stain.

3.
The Angel touch'd thee and forthwith
Thy chains from off thee fell
Oh loose us from the subtle coils
That link us close with Hell.

Pillar that cannot bend
With strength endue us; and the Faith
From heresy defend.

And lift our hearts with thine to heav'n's high throne,
Till faith beholds the clear meridian blaze,
And in the soul reigns charity alone.

Praise, blessing, majesty, thro' endless days,
Be to the Trinity immortal giv'n,
Who in pure unity profoundly sways,
Eternally all things in earth and Heav'n.

SAINTS, St. Anthony of Padua

If great wonders thou desirest
(Si quaeris)

Translated by Father Aylward, O. P.
Melody from a Slovak Hymnal


Andante moderato

1.
If great wonders thou desirest,
Hopeful to Saint Anthony pray;
Error, Satan, wants the direst,
Death and pest his will obey,
And the sick, who beg his pity,
From their couches haste away.

2.
Young and old are ever singing,
Praises to Saint Anthony bringing;
Stormy ocean calms its passion,
Bonds and fetters break in twain,
Treasures lost and limbs disabled,
These his pow'r restores again.

3.
Padua has been the witness
Of these deeds six hundred years;
Dangers flee and need must perish,
Grief and sorrow disappear,
Filling all the world with wonder,
While the demons quake with fear.

4.
Glory be to God the Father
And to His coequal Son,
To the Holy Ghost resplendent;
One in Three--Three in One;
Praise we Father, Son and Spirit
While eternal ages run.

Glorious Patron! Low before Thee
Kneel Thy sons, with hearts aflame!
And out voices blend in music,
Singing praises to thy name.
Saint John Baptist! Glorious Patron!
Saint La Salle we sound thy fame.

2.
Loyal to our Queen and Mother,
At her feet didst vow thy heart,
Earth, and all its joys, forsaking,
Thou didst choose the better part.
Saint La Salle, our glorious Father,
Pierce our souls with love's one dart.

3.
Model of the Christian teacher!
Patron of the Christian youth!
Lead us all to heights of glory,
As we strive in earnest ruth.
Saint La Salle! Oh, guard and guide use,
As we spread afar the Truth!

4.
In this life of sin and sorrow,
Saint La Salle, oh, guide our way,
In the hour of dark temptation,
Father! Be our spirit's stay!
Take our hand and lead us homeward,
Saint La Salle, to Heav'ns bright day!

From the Fransciscan Manual

Con Anima

1.
Blessed Francis, holy father,
Now our hearts to thee we raise,
As we gather 'round thine altar,
Pouring forth our hymns of praise.
Bless thy children, holy Francis,
Who thy mighty help implore,
For in heaven thou remainest,
Still the father of the poor.

2.
By thy love so deep and burning,
For thy Saviour crucified;
By the tokens which He gave thee
On thy hands and feet and side:
Bless thy children, holy Francis,
With those wounded hands of thine,
From thy glorious throne in heaven
Where resplendently they shine.

3.
Humble follower of Jesus.
Likened to Him in thy birth,
In thy way thro' life despising,
For His sake the goods of earth:
Make us love the priceless virtue
By our hidden God esteemed,
Make it valued, holy Francis,
By the souls of the redeemed.

4.
Teach us also, dear Saint Francis,
How to mourn for ev'ry sin;
May we walk in thy dear footsteps
Till the crown of life we win.
Bless thy children, holy Francis,
With those wounded hands of thine,
From thy glorious throne in heaven,
Where resplendently they shine.

Saint of the Sacred Heart

Father Faber
Nicola A. Montani


Andante

1.
Saint of the Sacred Heart,
Sweet teacher of the Word;
Partner of Mary's woes
And fav'rite of thy Lord!
Thou to whom grace was giv'n
To stand where Peter fell,
Whose heart could brook the Cross
Of Him it loved so well!

2.
We know not all thy gifts;
But this Christ bids us see,
That He Who so loved all
Found more to love in thee.
When the last evening came,
Thy head was on His Breast,
Pillowed on earth where now
In heav'n the Saints find rest.

3.
Dear Saint I stand far off
With vilest sins oppressed;
Oh may I dare, like thee,
To lean upon His Brest?
His touch could heal the sick,
His voice could raise the dead!
Oh that my soul might be
Where He allows thy head.

4.
The gifts He gave to thee
He gave thee to impart;
And I, too, claim with thee
His Mother and His Heart.
Ah teach me, then, dear Saint!
The secrets Christ taught thee,
The beatings of His Heart,
And how it beat for me.

The Maid of France, with visioned eyes

Rt. Rev. Msgr. H. T. Henry
(Written expressly for the St. Gregory Hymnal, all rights reserved)

Ancient French Melody

A traditional Catholic melody (Provencal Noel) known as "Marche dei Rei"
words of which are attributed to King Rene. The Noel, over two centuries
old, was utilized by Bizet in his incidental music to "L' Arlessierne."

Arr. by N. A. M.


1.
The Maid of France, with visioned eyes,
Saw messengers from Paradise
And Voices bore a hidden word
That only by her ear was heard.

Refrain
O blessed Maid, the chant we raise
That tells the meaning of thy praise:
Thou teachest us the lesson grand
Of love for God and Fatherland.

2.
The Visions and the Voices spoke
A wondrous message: "Break the yoke
That burdens France, and crown your King,
Sweet Herald of his triumphing!"

3.
The Maid believed the great command,
And fought for God and native land:
A model she shall ever lamp
To guide her feet in court or camp.

4.
O who shall dare her glory paint?
She lived a hero, dies a Saint:
A model she shall ever stand
Of love for God and Fatherland.

SAINTS, St. Cecilia

Let the deep organ swell the lay

Rev. C. Pise
Nicola. A. Montani


Marcato

1.
Let the deep organ swell the lay,
In honor of this festive day;
Let the harmonious choirs proclaim
Cecilia's ever blessed name.
Rome gave the virgin martyr birth,
Whose holy name hath filled the earth;
And from the early dawn of youth,
She fixed her heart on God and truth.

2.
Then from the world's bewild'ring strife,
In peace she spent her holy life,
Teaching the organ to combine
With voice, to praise the Lamb divine,
Cecilia, with a two-fold crown
Adorned in Heav'n, we pray look down
Upon thy fervent votaries here
And harken to their humble pray'r.

Andante religioso

1.
Sweet Agnes, holy child,
All purity,
Oh, may we undefiled,
Be pure as thee:
Ready our blood to shed
Forth as the martyrs led.
The path of pain to tread,
And die like thee.

2.
O gentle patroness
Of holy youth,
Ask God all those to bless
Who love the truth:
Oh, guide us on our way
Unto th'eternal day,
With hearts all pure and gay,
Dear Saint, like thine.

3.
Look down and hear our pray'r
From realms above,
Show us thy tender care,
Thy guiding love:
Oh, keep us in thy sight,
Till in th'unclouded light
Of Heav'n's pure vision bright
We dwell with thee.
