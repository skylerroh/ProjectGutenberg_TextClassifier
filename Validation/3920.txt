his house and court receive you, pass quickly through the hall until you
find my mother. She sits in the firelight by the hearth, spinning
sea-purple yarn, a marvel to behold, and resting against a pillar. Her
handmaids sit behind her. Here too my father's seat rests on the
self-same pillar, and here he sits and sips his wine like an immortal.
Passing him by, stretch out your hands to our mother's knees, if you
would see the day of your return in gladness and with speed, although
you come from far. If she regards you kindly in her heart, then there is
hope that you may see your friends and reach your stately house and
native land."

Saying this, with her bright whip she struck the mules, and fast they
left the river's streams; and well they trotted, well they plied their
feet, and skillfully she reined them that those on foot might
follow,--the waiting-women and Odysseus,--and moderately she used the
lash. The sun was setting when they reached the famous grove, Athene's
sacred ground where royal Odysseus sat him down. And thereupon he prayed
to the daughter of mighty Zeus:--

"Hearken, thou child of aegis-bearing Zeus, unwearied one! O hear me
now, although before thou didst not hear me, when I was wrecked, what
time the great Land-shaker wrecked me. Grant that I come among the
Phaeacians welcomed and pitied by them."

So spoke he in his prayer, and Pallas Athene heard, but did not yet
appear to him in open presence; for she regarded still her father's
brother, who stoutly strove with godlike Odysseus until he reached his
land.

Here, then, long-tried royal Odysseus made his prayer; but to the town
the strong mules bore the maid. And when she reached her father's famous
palace, she stopped before the door-way, and round her stood her
brothers, men like immortals, who from the cart unyoked the mules and
carried the clothing in. The maid went to her chamber, where a fire was
kindled for her by an old Apeirean woman, the chamber-servant
Eurymedousa, whom long ago curved ships brought from Apeira; her they
had chosen from the rest to be the gift of honor for Alcinoues, because
he was the lord of all Phaeacians, and people listened to his voice as
if he were a god. She was the nurse of white-armed Nausicaae at the
palace, and she it was who kindled her the fire and in her room prepared
her supper.

And now Odysseus rose to go to the city; but Athene kindly drew thick
clouds around Odysseus, for fear some bold Phaeacian meeting him might
trouble him with talk and ask him who he was. And just as he was
entering the pleasant town, the goddess, clear-eyed Athene, came to meet
him, disguised as a young girl who bore a water-jar. She paused as she
drew near, and royal Odysseus asked:--

"My child, could you not guide me to the house of one Alcinoues, who is
ruler of this people? For I am a toil-worn stranger come from far, out
of a distant land. Therefore I know not one among the men who own this
city and this land."

Then said to him the goddess, clear-eyed Athene: "Yes, good old
stranger, I will show the house for which you ask, for it stands near my
gentle father's. But follow in silence: I will lead the way. Cast not a
glance at any man and ask no questions, for our people do not well
endure a stranger, nor courteously receive a man who comes from
elsewhere. Yet they themselves trust in swift ships and traverse the
great deep, for the Earth-shaker permits them. Swift are their ships as
wing or thought."

Saying this, Pallas Athene led the way in haste, and he walked after in
the footsteps of the goddess. So the Phaeacians, famed for shipping, did
not observe him walking through the town among them, because Athene, the
fair-haired powerful goddess, did not allow it, but in the kindness of
her heart drew a marvelous mist around him. And now Odysseus admired the
harbors, the trim ships, the meeting-places of the lords themselves, and
the long walls that were so high, fitted with palisades, a marvel to
behold. Then as they neared the famous palace of the king, the goddess,
clear-eyed Athene, thus began:--

"Here, good old stranger, is the house you bade me show. You will see
heaven-descended kings sitting at table here. But enter, and have no
misgivings in your heart; for the courageous man in all affairs better
attains his end, come he from where he may. First you shall find the
Queen within the hall. Arete is her name.... Alcinoues took Arete for his
wife, and he has honored her as no one else on earth is honored among
the women who to-day keep houses for their husbands. Thus has she had a
heartfelt honor, and she has it still, from her own children, from
Alcinoues himself, and from the people also, who gaze on her as on a god
and greet her with welcomes when she walks about the town. For of sound
judgment, woman as she is, she has no lack; and those whom she regards,
though men, find troubles clear away. If she regards you kindly in her
heart, then there is hope that you may see your friends and reach your
high-roofed house and native land."

Saying this, clear-eyed Athene passed away, over the barren sea. She
turned from pleasant Scheria, and came to Marathon and wide-wayed Athens
and entered there the strong house of Erechtheus. Meanwhile Odysseus
neared the lordly palace of Alcinoues, and his heart was deeply stirred
so that he paused before he crossed the brazen threshold; for a sheen as
of the sun or moon played through the high-roofed house of generous
Alcinoues. On either hand ran walls of bronze from threshold to recess,
and round about the ceiling was a cornice of dark metal. Doors made of
gold closed in the solid building. The door-posts were of silver and
stood on a bronze threshold, silver the lintel overhead, and gold the
handle. On the two sides were gold and silver dogs; these had Hephaestus
wrought with subtle craft to guard the house of generous Alcinoues,
creatures immortal, young forever. Within were seats planted against the
wall on this side and on that, from threshold to recess, in long array;
and over these were strewn light fine-spun robes, the work of women.
Here the Phaeacian leaders used to sit, drinking and eating, holding
constant cheer. And golden youths on massive pedestals stood and held
flaming torches in their hands to light by night the palace for the
feasters.

In the King's house are fifty serving maids, some grinding at the mill
the yellow corn, some plying looms or twisting yarn, who as they sit are
like the leaves of a tall poplar; and from the close-spun linen drops
the liquid oil. And as Phaeacian men are skilled beyond all others in
speeding a swift ship along the sea, so are their women practiced at the
loom; for Athene has given them in large measure skill in fair works and
noble minds.

Without the court and close beside its gate is a large garden, covering
four acres; around it runs a hedge on either side. Here grow tall
thrifty trees--pears, pomegranates, apples with shining fruit, sweet
figs and thrifty olives. On them fruit never fails; it is not gone in
winter or in summer, but lasts throughout the year; for constantly the
west wind's breath brings some to bud and mellows others. Pear ripens
upon pear, apple on apple, cluster on cluster, fig on fig. Here too the
teeming vineyard has been planted, one part of which, the drying place,
lying on level ground, is heating in the sun; elsewhere men gather
grapes; and elsewhere still they tread them. In front, the grapes are
green and shed their flower, but a second row are now just turning dark.
And here trim garden-beds, along the outer line, spring up in every kind
and all the year are gay. Near by, two fountains rise, one scattering
its streams throughout the garden, one bounding by another course
beneath the courtyard gate toward the high house; from this the
towns-folk draw their water. Such at the palace of Alcinoues were the
gods' splendid gifts.

Here long-tried royal Odysseus stood and gazed. Then after he had gazed
his heart's fill on all, he quickly crossed the threshold and came
within the house.

SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY

Odysseus (Ulysses) has been cast ashore after a long battle with the
sea, following his attempt to escape on a raft from Calypso's island. He
has been saved by the intervention of the goddess Athene, who often
protects distressed heroes. When Book VI opens, he is sleeping in a
secluded nook under an olive tree. (For Odysseus's adventures on the
sea, consult Book V of the _Odyssey_.) Is Athene's visit to Nausicaae an
unusual sort of thing in Greek story? Does it appear that it was
customary for princesses to do their own washing? Note here that _I_
refers to the daughter of Dymas, since Athene is not speaking in her own
character. From Nausicaae's conversation with her father and her
preparations for departure, what can you judge of Greek family life? How
does the author make us see vividly the activities of Nausicaae and her
maids? Does the out-door scene appear true to life? _This virgin pure_
refers to Nausicaae, who is being compared to Artemis (Diana), the
goddess of the hunt. What plan has Athene for assisting Odysseus? From
the hero's speech, what can you tell of his character? Can you find out
what adjectives are usually applied to Odysseus in the _Iliad_ and the
_Odyssey_? Why does he here call Nausicaae "Princess"? What effect is his
speech likely to have? What can you tell of Nausicaae from her reply?
Give her reasons for not taking Odysseus with her to the town. Does she
fail in hospitality? What do her reasons show of the life of Greek
women? What do you judge of the prosperity of the Phaeacians? Why does
Nausicaae tell Odysseus to seek the favor of her mother? _Her father's
brother_ means Neptune (the Sea)--brother of Zeus, Athene's father;
Neptune is enraged at Odysseus and wishes to destroy him. _Here then_:
At this point Book VII begins. From what is said of Arete, what can you
tell of the influence of the Greek women? How does the author make you
feel the richness of Alcinoues's palace? How does it differ from modern
houses? _Corn_ means grain, not Indian corn, which, of course, had not
yet been brought from the New World. Note the vivid description of the
garden. How do you think Odysseus is received at the house of Alcinoues?
You can find out by reading the rest of Book VII of the _Odyssey_.

SUGGESTIONS FOR WRITING

=A Story from the Odyssey=:--Read, in a translation of the _Odyssey_, a
story of Odysseus, and tell it in your own words. The following stories
are appropriate: The Departure from Calypso's Island, Book V; The
Cyclops Polyphemus, Book IX; The Palace of Circe, Book X; The Land of
the Dead, Book XI; Scylla and Charybdis, Book XII; The Swineherd, Book
XIV; The Trial of the Bow, Book XXI; The Slaughter of the Suitors, Book
XXII.

After you have chosen a story, read it through several times, to fix the
details in your mind. Lay the book aside, and write the story simply,
but as vividly as possible.

=The Stranger=:--Explain the circumstances under which the stranger
appears. Are people startled at seeing him (or her)? Describe him. Is he
bewildered? Does he ask directions? Does he ask help? Quote his words
directly. How are his remarks received? Are people afraid of him? or do
they make sport of him? or do they receive him kindly? Who aids him?
Tell what he does and what becomes of him. Quote what is said of him
after he is gone.

Perhaps you will like to tell the story of Ulysses's arrival among the
Phaeacians, giving it a modern setting, and using modern names.

=Odysseus at the House of Alcinoues=:--Without reading Book VII of the
_Odyssey_, write what you imagine to be the conversation between
Alcinoues (or Arete) and Odysseus, when the shipwrecked hero enters the
palace.

ODYSSEUS

GEORGE CABOT LODGE


    He strove with Gods and men in equal mood
      Of great endurance: Not alone his hands
      Wrought in wild seas and labored in strange lands,
      And not alone his patient strength withstood
    The clashing cliffs and Circe's perilous sands:
      Eager of some imperishable good
      He drave new pathways thro' the trackless flood
      Foreguarded, fearless, free from Fate's commands.
    How shall our faith discern the truth he sought?
      We too must watch and wander till our eyes,
      Turned skyward from the topmost tower of thought,
    Haply shall find the star that marked his goal,
      The watch-fire of transcendent liberties
      Lighting the endless spaces of the soul.


SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY

Read the poem through. How did Ulysses strive with gods and men? Why can
it be said that he did not labor alone? Look up the story of Circe and
her palace.[10] What was the imperishable good that Ulysses sought? What
does his experience have to do with our lives? What sort of freedom does
the author speak of in the last few lines?

This verse-form is called the sonnet. How many lines has it? Make out a
scheme of the rhymes: _a b b a_, etc. Notice the change of thought at
the ninth line. Do all sonnets show this change?


EXERCISES

Read several other sonnets; for instance, the poem _On the Life-Mask of
Abraham Lincoln_, on page 210, or _On First Looking into Chapman's
Homer_, by John Keats, or _The Grasshopper and the Cricket_, by Leigh
Hunt.

Notice how these other sonnets are constructed. Why are they considered
good?

If possible, read part of what is said about the sonnet in _English
Verse_, by R.M. Alden or in _Forms of English Poetry_, by C.F. Johnson,
or in _Melodies of English Verse_, by Lewis Kennedy Morse; notice some
of the examples given.

Look in the good magazines for examples of the sonnet.
