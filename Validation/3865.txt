
Only journeymen and masters and kingsmen--in the general sense, both
men and women--had full rights of citizens, including the right to
marry by Public Law. Others might get married by Private Law, but that
was a rather uncomfortable method.

Under Private Law, a man and a woman would sign a contract to marry,
and if they succeeded in living together--"dwelling under the same
roof as husband and wife"--for five years without being discovered
by the Public Law police, they could then live together openly. They
would then be as legally married as the most respectable members of the
Guild of Merchants. But if the Public Law police caught them before the
"years of cover" were completed, they were separated and sold as slaves.

Permission of all the parents was required for marriage by Public
Law, whatever the age of the lovers. Consequently, even high-ranking
guildfolk sometimes took their chances with Private Law, although most
who tried it ended their lives threshing rye for the Lords of the West.

For example, Singwell and Gray-eyes....

Snubnose found such thoughts painful. He glanced at his sister and
wondered how she could go on looking so cheerful. "But I suppose I look
cheerful, myself," he thought. Indeed, he had the kind of face that
couldn't look otherwise.

Snubnose followed his sister's eyes to the Candidate's stool; where
Bump-arch, Proudwalk's lover and his friend, sat indolently, with his
long legs twisted under him.

He wondered what Proudwalk and Bump-arch were going to do.

Certainly they weren't going to get married by Public Law. He
winced as he remembered the furious screams of his mother every
time Proudwalk brought up the question. Snubnose took his sister's
side, but it seemed hopeless to win their mother over. And even if
they succeeded, it wouldn't do any good. Bump-arch wasn't going to
qualify for journeyman's rank, because he had stubbornly insisted on a
demonstration that was sure to fail.

It was a crazy situation, Snubnose thought. Here he himself was a
full-fledged journeyman, and here was his sister a full-fledged
journeywoman, while a talented fellow like Bump-arch would remain an
apprentice or become a guildless outcast. For that difficulty he had
nobody to blame but himself, Snubnose reflected, in the virtuous way we
meditate upon the mistakes of our friends.

Now the Grandmaster was introducing Crookback, Bump-arch's master, and
as late as the previous Day of the Candidate, Snubnose's master as
well. Snubnose looked at the old man more affectionately than he had
while in his service. But he blamed Crookback for permitting Bump-arch
to go ahead with his impossible demonstration. He was puzzled, as
usual, by the motives of the old master physicist, born with a bent
body and a clever, enigmatic mind.

A few formal words, a brief joke, and a couple of compliments--and
Crookback presented the Candidate.

Bump-arch unwound his legs and stood before them. "Elder ones," he
began traditionally, and Snubnose thought he caught a quick, impudent
look. Bump-arch was young--the three of them were young together in
their city and their time--but he was two years older than Snubnose and
a year older than Proudwalk. He had started his apprenticeship a little
later than was usual.

"I will say the thing. I will attempt the thing. Yours, elder ones, to
judge whether the thing is done, whether I am worthy to sit among you."
These too were traditional phrases.

"I will construct a chamber," he said casually, "in which I will go
irreversibly from today, 155th-1712 DRC, to a day in the future,
155th-1717 DRC. I would be proud to claim this demonstration as my own
discovery, but it is not; it is a restored experiment. I follow the
directions I copied, while still a boy, from an ancient inscription
in a vault outside the walls. The vault was afterward buried by the
earthquake."

"And very conveniently too," Snubnose added to himself. Bump-arch had
not admitted it, even to him, but Snubnose was convinced that the
chamber was his friend's own invention.

"Reverence, elder ones," Bump-arch said and walked to the arched door
of the meeting room.

"Time," said the Grandmaster.

Snubnose, rising, heard a conversation behind him, as two master
chemists shuffled to their feet.

"Do you think the youngster will do it?" one asked.

"Well, there's a tradition about it," the other said.

"Yes, and there's a tradition about the elixir of life and a hundred
texts as well, and you remember what happened to the young fellow who
tried to make it."

There was a chuckle. "I remember, and he's not so young any more, and
he's the best apprentice I have for washing glassware. Most experience."

Proudwalk had heard the conversation also, and her face turned red. She
raised her delicate nose--quite unlike her brother's snub--and sniffed
loudly.

"I think I smell hydrogen sulfide," she said.

       *       *       *       *       *

Carrying his copper staff the Grandmaster paced to the arched doorway,
followed by Crookback. Bump-arch bowed as they preceded him through the
door; and he had to bend his head again to pass through, for Bump-arch
was partly of Bowman stock and tall for a man of the City.

The masters and mistresses of the Guild, the journeymen and
