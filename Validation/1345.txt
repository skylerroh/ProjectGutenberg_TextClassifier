strength of argument, that everybody present was inclined to believe
him, except Morgan, who affirmed there was no trusting to appearances;
for he himself had been so much imposed upon by his behaviour two days
before, that he had actually unbound him with his own hands, and
had well nigh been murdered for his pains: this was confirmed by the
evidence of one of the waiters, who declared he had pulled this patient
from the doctor's mate, whom he had gotten down, and almost strangled.
To this the man answered, that the witness was a creature of Morgan's,
and suborned to give his testimony against him by the malice of the
mate, whom the defendant had affronted, by discovering to the people on
board, that Mr. Morgan's wife kept a gin-shop in Ragfair. This anecdote
produced a laugh at the expense of the Welshman, who, shaking his head
with some emotion, said, "Ay, ay, 'tis no matter. Cot knows, it is
an arrant falsehood." Captain Oakum, without any farther hesitation,
ordered the fellow to be unfettered; at the same time, threatening to
make Morgan exchange situations with him for his spite; but the Briton
no sooner heard the decision in favour of the madman, than he got up to
the mizen-shrouds, crying to Thompson and me to get out of his reach,
for we should see him play the devil with a vengeance. We did not think
fit to disregard his caution, and accordingly got up on the poop, whence
we beheld the maniac (as soon as he was released) fly at the captain
like a fury, crying, "I'll let you know, you scoundrel, that I am
commander of this vessel," and pummel him without mercy. The surgeon,
who went to the assistance of his patron, shared the same fate; and
it was with the utmost difficulty that he was mastered at last, after
having done great execution among those who opposed him.






CHAPTER XXVIII

The Captain enraged, threatens to put the Madman to death with his own
hand--is diverted from that resolution by the arguments and persuasion
of the first Lieutenant and Surgeon--we set sail for St. Helen's, join
the fleet under the command of Sir C-- O--gle, and proceed for the West
Indies--are overtaken by a terrible tempest--my friend Jack Rattlin
has his leg broke by a fall from the mainyard--the behaviour of Mr.
Mackshane--Jack opposes the amputation of his limb, in which he
is seconded by Morgan and me, we undertake the cure and perform it
successfully

The captain was carried into his cabin, so enraged with the treatment he
had received, that he ordered the fellow to be brought before him, that
he might have the pleasure of pistoling him with his own hand; and would
certainly have satisfied his revenge in this manner, had not the
first lieutenant remonstrated against it, by observing that, in all
appearances, the fellow was not mad, but desperate; that he had been
hired by some enemy of the captain's to him, and therefore ought to be
kept in irons till he could be brought to a court-martial, which, no
doubt, would sift the affair to the bottom (by which means important
discoveries might be made), and then sentence the criminal to a death
according to his demerits. This suggestion, improbable as it was, had
the desired effect upon the captain, being exactly calculated for the
meridan of his intellects; more especially as Dr. Mackshane espoused
this opinion, in consequence of his previous declaration that the man
was not mad. Morgan finding there was no more damage done, could not
help discovering by his countenance the pleasure he enjoyed on this
occasion; and, while he bathed the doctor's face with an embrocation,
ventured to ask him, whether he thought there were more fools or madmen
on board? But he would have been wiser in containing this sally, which
his patient carefully laid up in his memory, to be taken notice of at
a more fit season. Meanwhile we weighed anchor, and, on our way to the
Downs, the madman, who was treated as a prisoner, took an opportunity,
while the sentinel attending him was at the head, to leap and frustrate
the revenge of the captain. We stayed not long at the Downs, but took
the benefit of the first easterly wind to go round to Spithead: where,
having received provisions on board for six months, we sailed from
St. Helen's in the grand fleet bound for the West Indies, on the
ever-memorable expedition of Carthagena.

It was not without great mortification I saw myself on the point of
being transported to such a distant and unhealthy climate, destitute of
every convenience that could render such a voyage supportable, and
under the dominion of an arbitrary tyrant, whose command was almost
intolerable; however, as these complaints were common to a great many on
board, I resolved to submit patiently to my fate, and contrive to make
myself as easy as the nature of the case would allow. We got out of the
channel with a prosperous breeze, which died away, leaving us becalmed
about fifty leagues to the westward of the Lizard: but this state of
inaction did not last long; for next night our maintop-sail was split
by the wind, which, in the morning, increased to a hurricane. I was
awakened by a most horrible din, occasioned by the play of the gun
carriages upon the decks above, the cracking of cabins, the howling of
the wind through the shrouds, the confused noise of the ship's crew, the
pipes of the boatswain and his mates, the trumpets of the lieutenants,
and the clanking of the chain pumps. Morgan who had never been at
sea before, turned out in a great hurry, crying, "Cot have mercy and
compassion upon us! I believe, we have cot upon the confines of Lucifer
and the d--n'd!" while poor Thompson lay quaking in his hammock, putting
up petitions to heaven for our safety. I rose and joined the Welshman,
with whom (after having fortified ourselves with brandy) I went above;
but if my sense of hearing was startled before, how must my sight have
been apalled in beholding the effects of the storm! The sea was swelled
into billows mountain-high, on the top of which our ship sometimes hung
as if it were about to be precipitated to the abyss below! Sometimes
we sank between two waves that rose on each side higher than our
topmast-head, and threatened by dashing together to overwhelm us in a
moment! Of all our fleet, consisting of a hundred and fifty sail, scarce
twelve appeared, and these driving under their bare poles, at the mercy
of the tempest. At length the mast of one of them gave way, and tumbled
overboard with a hideous crash! Nor was the prospect in our own ship
much more agreeable; a number of officers and sailors ran backward and
forward with distraction in their looks, halloaing to one another, and
undetermined what they should attend to first. Some clung to the yards,
endeavouring to unbend the sails that were split into a thousand pieces
flapping in the wind; others tried to furl those which were yet whole,
while the masts, at every pitch, bent and quivered like twigs, as if
they would have shivered into innumerable splinters! While I considered
this scene with equal terror and astonishment, one of the main braces
broke, by the shock whereof two sailors were flung from the yard's arm
into the sea, where they perished, and poor Jack Rattlin thrown
down upon the deck, at the expense of a broken leg. Morgan and I ran
immediately to his assistance, and found a splinter of the shin-bone
thrust by the violence of the fall through the skin; as this was a case
of too great consequence to be treated without the authority of the
doctor I went down to his cabin to inform him of the accident, as well
as to bring up dressings which we always kept ready prepared. I entered
his apartment without any ceremony, and, by the glimmering of a lamp,
perceived him on his knees before something that very much resembled a
crucifix; but this I will not insist upon, that I may not seem too much
a slave to common report, which indeed assisted my conjecture on this
occasion, by representing Dr. Mackshane as a member of the church of
Rome. Be this as it will, he got up in a sort of confusion, occasioned
(I suppose) by his being disturbed in his devotion, and in a trice
snatched the subject of my suspicion from my sight.

After making an apology for my intrusion, I acquainted him with the
situation of Rattlin, but could by no means prevail upon him to visit
him on deck, where he lay; he bade me desire the boatswain to order some
of the men to carry him down to the cockpit, "and in the meantime,"
said he, "I will direct Thompson to get ready the dressings." When I
signified to the boatswain the doctor's desire, he swore a terrible
oath, that he could not spare one man from deck, because he expected the
mast would go by the board every minute. This piece of information did
not at all contribute to my peace of mind; however, as my friend Rattlin
complained very much, with the assistance of Morgan I supported him to
the lower deck, whither Mr. Mackshane, after much entreaty, ventured to
come, attended by Thompson, with a box full of dressings, and his own
servant, who carried a whole set of capital instruments. He examined the
fracture and the wound, and concluding, from a livid colour extending
itself upon the limb, that mortification would ensue, resolved to
amputate the leg immediately. This was a dreadful sentence to the
patient, who, recruiting himself with a quid of tobacco, pronounced
with a woful countenance, "What! is there no remedy, doctor! must I be
dock'd? can't you splice it?" "Assuredly, Doctor Mackshane," said the
first mate, "with submission, and deference, and veneration, to your
superior apilities, and opportunities, and stations, look you, I
do apprehend, and conjure, and aver, that there is no occasion nor
necessity to smite off this poor man's leg." "God Almighty bless you,
dear Welshman!" cried Rattlin, "may you have fair wind and weather
wheresoever you're bound, and come to an anchor in the road of heaven at
last!" Mackshane, very much incensed at his mate's differing in opinion
from him, so openly, answered, that he was not bound to give an account
of his practice to him; and in a peremptory tone, ordered him to apply
the tourniquet. At the sight of which, Jack, starting up, cried, "Avast,
avast! D--n my heart, if you clap your nippers on me, till I know
wherefore! Mr. Random, won't you lend a hand towards saving my precious
limb! Odd's heart, if Lieutenant Bowling was here, he would not suffer
Jack Rattlin's leg to be chopped off like a piece of old junk."

This pathetic address to me, joined to my inclination to serve my honest
friend, and the reasons I had to believe there was no danger in delaying
the amputation, induced me to declare myself of the first mate's
opinion, and affirm that the preternatural colour of the skin was owing
to an inflammation, occasioned by a contusion, and common in all such
cases, without any indication of an approaching gangrene. Morgan, who
had a great opinion of my skill, manifestly exulted in my fellowship,
and asked Thompson's sentiments in the matter, in hopes of strengthening
our association with him too; but he, being of a meek disposition, and
either dreading the enmity of the surgeon, or speaking the dictates of
his own judgment, in a modest manner espoused the opinion of Mackshane,
who by this time having consulted with himself, determined to act in
such a manner as to screen himself from censure, and at the same time
revenge himself on us, for our arrogance in contradicting him. With this
view, he asked if we would undertake to cure the leg at our peril: that
is, be answerable for the consequence. To this question, Morgan replied,
that the lives of his creatures are at the hands of Cot alone; and it
would be great presumption in him to undertake for an event that was in
the power of his Maker, no more than the doctor could promise to cure
all the sick to whom he administered his assistance; but if the patient
would put himself under our direction, we would do our endeavour to
bring his distemper to a favourable issue, to which at present we saw no
obstruction.

I signified my concurrence; and Rattlin was so overjoyed that, shaking
us both by the hands, he swore nobody else should touch him, and, if he
died, his blood should be upon his own head. Mr. Mackshane, flattering
himself with the prospect of our miscarriage, went away, and left us to
manage it as we should think proper; accordingly, having sawed off part
of the splinter that stuck through the skin, we reduced the fracture,
dressed the wound, applied the eighteen-tailed bandage, and put the leg
in a box, secundam artem. Everything succeeded according to our wish,
and we had the satisfaction of not only preserving the poor fellow's
leg, but likewise of rendering the doctor contemptible among the ship's
company, who had all their eyes on us during the course of this cure,
which was completed in six weeks.






CHAPTER XXIX

Mackshane's malice--I am taken up and imprisoned for a spy--Morgan meets
with the same fate--Thompson is tampered with to turn evidence against
us--disdains the proposal, and is maltreated for his integrity--Morgan
is released to assist the Surgeon during an engagement with some French
ships-of-war--I remain fettered on the poop, exposed to the enemy's
shot, and grow delirious with fear--am comforted after the battle by
Morgan, who speaks freely of the captain, is overheard by the sentinel,
who informs against him, and again imprisoned--Thompson grows desperate,
and, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Morgan and me, goes overboard
in the night

In the meantime the storm subsided into a brisk gale, that carried us
into the warm latitudes, where the weather became intolerable, and
the crew very sickly. The doctor left nothing unattempted towards the
completion of his vengeance against the Welshman and me. He went among
the sick under pretence of inquiring into their grievances, with a
view of picking up complaints to our prejudice; but, finding himself
frustrated in that expectation by the goodwill we had procured from
the patients by our diligence and humanity, he took the resolution of
listening to our conversation, by hiding himself behind the canvas that
surrounded our berth; here too he was detected by the boy of our mess,
who acquainted us with this piece of behaviour, and one night, while we
were picking a large bone of salt beef, Morgan discerned something stir
on the outside of our hangings, which immediately interpreting to be the
doctor, he tipped me the wink, and pointed to the place, where I could
perceive somebody standing; upon which, I snatched up the bone, and
levelled it with all my force at him, saying, "Whoever you are, take
that for your curiosity." It had the desired effect, for we heard the
listener tumble down, and afterwards crawl to his own cabin. I applauded
myself much for this feat, which turned out one of the most unlucky
exploits of my life, Mackshane, from that time, marking me out for
destruction.

About a week after this exploit, as I was going my rounds among
the sick, I was taken prisoner, and carried to the poop by the
master-at-arms, where I was loaded with irons, and stapled to the deck,
on pretence that I was a spy on board, and had conspired against the
captain's life. How ridiculous soever this imputation was, I did not
fail to suffer by it all the rigour that could be shown to the worst of
criminals, being exposed in this miserable condition to the scorching
heat of the sun by day, and the unwholesome damps by night, during
the space of twelve days, in which I was neither brought to trial,
nor examined touching the probability of the charge. I had no sooner
recovered the use of my reflection, which had been quite overthrown by
this accident, than I sent for Thompson, who, after condoling me on
the occasion, hinted, that I owed this misfortune to the hatred of
the doctor, who had given an information against me to the captain, in
consequence of which I was arrested, and all my papers seized. While I
was cursing my capricious fate, I saw Morgan ascend the poop, guarded by
two corporals, who made him sit down by me, that he might be pinioned in
the same machine. Notwithstanding my situation, I could scarce refrain
from laughing at the countenance of my fellow prisoner, who, without
speaking one word, allowed his feet to be inclosed in the rings provided
for that purpose; but, when they pretended to fasten him on his back
he grew outrageous, and drawing a large couteau from his side-pocket,
threatened to rip up the belly of the first man that should approach
him, in order to treat him in such an unworthy manner. They were
prepared to use him very roughly, when the lieutenant on the
quarter-deck called up to them to let him remain as he was. He then
crept towards me, and, taking me by the hand, bade me "put my trust
in Cot." And looking at Thompson, who sat by us trembling, with a pale
visage; told him there were two more rings for his feet, and he should
be glad to find him in such good company. But it was not the intention
of our adversary to include the second mate in our fate: him he expected
to be his drudge in attending the sick and, if possible, his evidence
against us: with this view he sounded him afar off, but, finding his
integrity incorruptible, harrassed him so much out of spite, that in a
short time this mild creature grew weary of his life.

While I and my fellow prisoner comforted each other in our tribulation,
the admiral discovered four sail to leeward and made signal for our
ship and four more to chase: hereupon everything was cleared for an
engagement, and Mackshane, foreseeing he should have occasion for more
assistants than one obtained Morgan's liberty, while I was let in this
deplorable posture to the chance of battle. It was almost dark when we
came up with the sternmost chase, which we hailed, and inquired who they
were. They gave us to understand they were French men-of-war, upon which
Captain Oakum commanded them to send their boat on board of him! but
they refused, telling him, if he had any business with them, to come
on board of their ship: he then threatened to pour in a broadside upon
them, which they promised to retain. Both sides were as good as their
word, and the engagement began with great fury. The reader may guess how
I passed my time, lying in this helpless situation, amidst the terrors
of a sea-fight; expecting every moment to be cut asunder, or dashed in
pieces by the enemy's shot! I endeavoured to compose myself as much as
possible, by reflecting that I was not a whit more exposed than those
who were stationed about me; but, when I beheld them employed without
intermission in annoying the foe, and encouraged by the society and
behaviour of one another, I could easily perceive a wide difference
between their condition and mine: however, I concealed my agitation as
well as I could till the head of the officer of marines who stood near
me, being shot off, bounced from the deck athwart my face, leaving me
well nigh blinded with brains. I could contain myself no longer, but
began to bellow with all the strength of my lungs; when a drummer,
coming towards me asked if I was wounded, and, before I could answer,
received a great shot in his belly, which tore out his entrails, and
he fell flat on my breast. This accident entirely bereft me of all
discretion; I redoubled my cries, which were drowned in the noise of the
battle; and, finding myself disregarded, lost all patience, and became
frantic. I vented my rage in oaths and execrations, till my spirits,
being quite exhausted, I remained quiet, as insensible of the load that
oppressed me.

The engagement lasted till broad day, when Captain Oakum, finding he was
like to gain neither honour nor advantage by the affair, pretended to
be undeceived by seeing their colours; and, hailing the ship whom he
had fought all night, protested he believed them Spaniards; and the guns
being silenced on each side, ordered the barge to be hoisted out, and
went on board the French commodore. Our loss amounted to ten killed, and
eighteen wounded, most part of whom afterwards died. My fellow-mates
had no sooner despatched their business in the cock-pit, than, full of
friendly concern, they came to visit me. Morgan, ascending first, and
seeing my face almost covered with brains and blood, concluded I was
no longer a man for this world; and, calling to Thompson with great
emotion, bade him come up, and take his last farewell of his comrade
and countryman, who was posted to a better place, where there were no
Mackshanes nor Oakums to asperse and torment him. "No," said he, taking
me by the hand, "you are going to a country where there is more respect
sown to unfortunate shentlemen, and where you will have the satisfaction
of peholding your adversaries tossing upon pillows of purning
primstone." Thompson, alarmed at this apostrophe, made haste to the
place where I lay, and sitting down by me, with tears in his eyes
inquired into the nature of my calamity. By this time I had recollected
myself so far as to be able to converse rationally with my friends,
whom, to their great satisfaction, I immediately undeceived with regard
to their apprehension of my being mortally wounded.

After I had got myself disengaged from the carnage in which I wallowed,
and partaken of a refreshment which my friends brought along with them,
we entered into discourse upon the hardships we sustained, and spoke
very freely of the author of our misery; but our discourse being
overheard by the sentinel who guarded me, he was no sooner relieved than
he reported to the captain every syllable of our conversation, according
to the orders he had received. The effect of this information soon
appeared in the arrival of the master-at-arms, who replaced Morgan in
his former station, and gave the second mate a caution to keep a strict
guard over his tongue, if he did not choose to accompany us in our
confinement. Thompson, foreseeing that the whole slavery of attending
the sick and wounded, as well as the cruelty of Mackshane, must now fall
upon his shoulders, grew desperate at the prospect, and, though I never
heard him swear before, imprecated dreadful curses on the heads of his
oppressors, declaring that he would rather quit life altogether than
be much longer under the power of such barbarians. I was not a little
startled at his vivacity, and endeavoured to alleviate his complaints,
by representing the subject of my own, with as much aggravation as it
would bear, by which comparison he might see the balance of misfortune
lay on my side, and take an example from me of fortitude and submission,
till such time as we could procure redress, which I hoped was not far
off, considering that we should probably be in a harbour in less than
three days, where we should have an opportunity of preferring our
complaints to the admiral. The Welshman joined in my remonstrance, and
was at great pains to demonstrate that it was every man's duty as well
as interest to resign himself to the divine will, and look upon himself
as a sentinel upon duty, who is by no means at liberty to leave his post
before he is relieved. Thompson listened attentively to what he said,
and at last, shedding a flood of tears, shook his hand, and left us
without making any reply. About eleven at night he came to see us again
with a settled gloom on his countenance, and gave us to understand that
he had undergone excessive toil since he saw us, and in recompense had
been grossly abused by the doctor, who taxed him with being confederate
with us, in a design of taking away his life and that of the captain.
After some time spent in mutual exhortation, he got up, and squeezing me
by the hand with uncommon fervour, cried, "God bless you both!" and left
us to wonder at his singular manner of parting with us, which did not
fail to make a deep impression on us both.

Next morning, when the hour of visitation came round, the unhappy
young man was missing, and, after strict search, supposed to have gone
overboard in the night; and this was certainly the case.






CHAPTER XXX

We lament the fate of our companion--the Captain offers Morgan his
liberty, which he refuses to accept--we are brought before him and
examined--Morgan is sent back into custody, whither also I am remanded
after a curious trial

The news of this event affected my fellow prisoner and me extremely, as
our unfortunate companion had justly acquired by his amiable disposition
the love and esteem of us both; and the more we regretted his
untimely fate, the greater horror we conceived for the villain who
was undoubtedly the occasion of it. This abandoned miscreant did not
discover the least symptom of concern for Thompson's death, although he
must have been conscious to himself of having driven him by ill usage to
the fatal resolution, but desired the captain to set Morgan at liberty
again to look after the patients. Accordingly one of the corporals was
sent up to unfetter him, but he protested he would not be released until
he should know for what he was confined; nor would he be a tennisball,
nor a shuttlecock, nor a trudge, nor a scullion, to any captain under
the sun. Oakum, finding him obstinate, and fearing it would not be in
his power to exercise his tyranny much longer with impunity, was willing
to show some appearance of justice and therefore ordered us both to be
brought before him on the quarter-deck, where he sat in state, with his
cleric on one side, and his counsellor Mackshane on the other. When we
approached, he honoured us with this salutation: "So, gentlemen, d--n
my blood! many a captain in the navy would have ordered you both to
be tucked up to the yard's arm, without either judge or jury, for the
crimes you have been guilty of; but, d--n my blood, I have too much good
nature in allowing such dogs as you to make defence." "Captain Oakum,"
said my fellow-sufferer, "certainly it is in your power (Cot help
the while) to tack us all up at your will, desire, and pleasures.
And perhaps it would be petter for some of us to be tucked up than to
undergo the miseries to which we have been exposed. So may the farmer
hang his kids for his diversion, and amusement, and mirth; but there is
such a thing as justice, if not upon earth, surely in heaven, that will
punish with fire and primstone all those who take away the lives of
innocent people out of wantonness, and parparity (look you). In the mean
time. I shall be glad to know the crimes laid to my charge, and see
the person who accuses me." "That you shall," said the captain; "here,
doctor, what have you to say?" Mackshane, stepping forward, hemmed a
good while, in order to clear his throat, and, before he began, Morgan
accosted him thus: "Doctor Mackshane, look in my face--look in the face
of an honest man, who abhors a false witness as he abhors the tevil,
and Cot be judge between you and me." The doctor, not minding this
conjuration, made the following speech, as near as I can remember: "I'll
tell you what, Mr. Morgan; to be sure what you say is just, in regard
to an honest man, and if so be it appears as how you are an honest man,
then it is my opinion that you deserve to be acquitted, in relation to
that there affair, for I tell you what, Captain Oakum is resolved for to
do everybody justice. As for my own part, all that I have to allege is,
that I have been informed you have spoken disrespectful words against
your captain, who, to be sure, is the most honourable and generous
commander in the king's service, without asparagement or acception of
man, woman, or child."

Having uttered this elegant harangue, on which he seemed to plume
himself, Morgan replied, "I do partly guess, and conceive, and
understand your meaning, which I wish could be more explicit; but,
however, I do suppose, I am not to be condemned upon bare hearsay; or,
if I am convicted of speaking disrespectfully of Captain Oakum, I hope
there is no treason in my words." "But there's mutiny, by G--d, and
that's death by the articles of war!" cried Oakum: "In the meantime, let
the witnesses be called." Hereupon Mackshane's servant appeared, and the
boy of our mess, whom they had seduced and tutored for the purpose. The
first declared, that Morgan as he descended the cockpit-ladder one day,
cursed the captain, and called him a savage beast, saying, he ought to
be hunted down as an enemy to mankind. "This," said the clerk, "is a
strong presumption of a design, formed against the captain's life. For
why? It presupposes malice aforethought, and a criminal intention a
priori." "Right," said the captain to this miserable grub, who had
been an attorney's boy, "you shall have law enough: here's Cook and
Littlejohn to it." This evidence was confirmed by the boy, who affirmed,
he heard the first mate say, that the captain had no more bowels than a
bear, and the surgeon had no more brain than an ass. Then the sentinel,
who heard our discourse on the poop was examined, and informed the court
that the Welshman assured me, Captain Oakum and Doctor Mackshane would
toss upon billows of burning brimstone in hell for their barbarity. The
clerk observed, that there was an evident prejudication, which confirmed
the former suspicion of a conspiracy against the life of Captain Oakum;
for, because, how could Morgan so positively pronounce that the captain
and surgeon would d--n'd, unless he had intention to make away with them
before they could have time to repent? This sage explanation had great
weight with our noble commander, who exclaimed, "What have you to say to
this, Taffy? you seem to be taken all a-back, brother, ha!" Morgan
was too much of a gentleman to disown the text, although he absolutely
denied the truth of the comment. Upon which the captain, strutting up
to him with a ferocious countenance, said, "So Mr. son of a bitch, you
confess you honoured me with the names of bear and beast, and pronounced
my damnation? D--n my heart! I have a good mind to have you brought to a
court-martial and hang'd, you dog." Here Mackshane, having occasion for
an assistant, interposed, and begged the captain to pardon Mr. Morgan
with his wonted goodness, upon condition that he the delinquent should
make such submission as the nature of his misdemeanour demanded.
Upon which the Cambro-Briton, who on this occasion would have made no
submission to the Great Mogul, surrounded with his guards, thanked the
doctor for his mediation, and acknowledged himself in the wrong for
calling the image of Cot a peast, "but," said he, "I spoke by metaphor,
and parable, and comparison, and types; as we signify meekness by a
lamb, lechery by a goat, and craftiness by a fox; so we liken ignorance
to an ass, and brutality to a bear, and fury to a tiger; therefore I
made use of these similes to express my sentiments (look you), and what
I said before Cot, I will not unsay before man nor peast neither."

Oakum was so provoked at this insolence (as he termed it,) that he
ordered him forthwith to be carried to the place of his confinement, and
his clerk to proceed on the examination of me. The first question put
to me was touching the place of my nativity, which I declared to be the
north of Scotland. "The north of Ireland more like!" cried the captain;
"but we shall bring you up presently." He then asked what religion I
professed; and when I answered "the Protestant," swore I was an
arrant Roman as ever went to mass. "Come, come, clerk," continued
he, "catechise him a little on this subject." But before I relate the
particulars of the clerk's inquiries, it will not be amiss to inform the
reader that our commander himself was an Hibernian, and, if not shrewdly
belied, a Roman Catholic to boot. "You say, you are a Protestant," said
the clerk; "make the sign of the cross with your finger, so, and swear
upon it to that affirmation." When I was about to perform the ceremony,
the captain cried with some emotion, "No, no, d--me! I'll have no
profanation neither. But go on with your interrogations." "Well then,"
proceeded my examiner, "how many sacraments are there?" To which I
replied, "Two." "What are they?" said he. I answered, "Baptism and the
Lord's Supper." "And so you would explode confirmation and marriage
altogether?" said Oakum. "I thought this fellow was a rank Roman." The
clerk, though he was bred under an attorney, could not refrain from
blushing at this blunder, which he endeavoured to conceal, by observing,
that these decoys would not do with me, who seemed to be an old
offender. He went on with asking, if I believed in transubstantiation;
but I treated the notion of real presence with such disrespect, that his
patron was scandalised at my impiety, and commanded him to proceed to
the plot. Whereupon this miserable pettifogger told me, there was great
reason to suspect me of being a spy on board, and that I had entered
into a conspiracy with Thompson, and others not yet detected, against
the life of Captain Oakum, which accusation they pretended to support
by the evidence of our boy, who declared he had often heard the deceased
Thompson and me whispering together, and could distinguish the words,
"Oakum, rascal, poison, pistol;" by which expressions it appeared, we
did intend to use sinister means to accomplish his destruction. That the
death of Thompson seemed to confirm this conjecture, who, either feeling
the stings of remorse for being engaged in such a horrid confederacy,
or fearing a discovery, by which he must have infallibly suffered an
ignominious death, had put a fatal period to his own existence. But what
established the truth of the whole was, a book in cyphers found among
my papers, which exactly tallied with one found in his chest, after his
disappearance. This, he observed, was a presumption very near positive
proof, and would determine any jury in Christendom to find me guilty.
In my own defence, I alleged, that I had been dragged on board at first
very much against my inclination, as I could prove by the evidence
of some people now in the ship, consequently could have no design of
becoming spy at that time; and ever since had been entirely out of the
reach of any correspondence that could justly entail that suspicion
upon me. As for conspiring against my captain's life, it could not be
supposed that any man in his right wits would harbour the least thought
of such an undertaking, which he could not possibly perform without
certain infamy and ruin to himself, even if he had all the inclination
in the world. That, allowing the boy's evidence to be true (which I
affirmed was false and malicious), nothing conclusive could be gathered
from a few incoherent words; neither was the fate of Mr. Thompson a
circumstance more favourable for the charge; for I had in my pocket a
letter which too well explained that mystery, in a very different manner
from that which was supposed. With these words, I produced the following
letter, which Jack Rattlin brought to me the very day after Thompson
disappeared; and told me it was committed to his care by the deceased,
who made him promise not to deliver it sooner. The clerk, taking it out
of my hand, read aloud the contents, which were these;


'Dear Friend,--I am so much oppressed with the fatigue I daily and
nightly undergo, and the barbarous usage of Doctor Mackshane, who is
bent on your destruction as well as mine, that I am resolved to free
myself from this miserable life, and, before you receive this, shall
be no more. I could have wished to die in your good opinion, which I am
afraid I shall forfeit by the last act of my life; but, if you cannot
acquit me, I know you will at least preserve some regard for the memory
of an unfortunate young man who loved you. I recommend it to you, to
beware of Mackshane, whose revenge is implacable. I wish all prosperity
to you and Mr. Morgan, to whom pray offer my last respects, and beg to
be remembered as your unhappy friend and countryman, 'William Thompson.'

This letter was no sooner read, than Mackshane, in a transport of
rage, snatched it out of the clerk's hands, and tore it into a thousand
pieces, saying, it was a villainous forgery, contrived and executed by
myself. The captain and clerk declared themselves of the same opinion,
although I insisted of having the remains of it compared with other
writings of Thompson, which they had in their possession; and I was
ordered to answer the last article of my accusation, namely, the book of
ciphers found among my papers. "That is easily done," said I. "What you
are pleased to all ciphers, are no other than the Greek characters, in
which, for my amusement, I keep a diary of everything remarkable that
has occurred to my observation since the beginning of the voyage, till
the day in which I was put in irons; and the same method was practised
by Mr. Thompson, who copied mine." "A very likely story," cried
Mackshane; "what occasion was there for using Greek characters, if you
were not afraid of discovering what you had wrote? But what d'ye talk of
Greek characters? D'ye think I am so ignorant of the Greek language, as
not to distinguish its letters from these, which are no more Greek than
Chinese? No, no, I will not give up my knowledge of the Greek for
you, nor none that ever came from your country." So saying, with an
unparalleled effrontery, he repeated some gibberish, which by the sound
