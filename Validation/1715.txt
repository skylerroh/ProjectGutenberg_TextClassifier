We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.


We need your donations more than ever!

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Illinois Benedictine College (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,

     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC

     payable to "Project Gutenberg Association / Illinois
     Benedictine College" within the 60 days following each
     date you prepare (or were legally required to prepare)
     your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax return.

        FROM THE "EIGHT SONGS," Wittenberg, 1524.

I. - Nun freut euch, lieben Christen g'mein. (1523)

       "A Song of Thanksgiving for the great Benefits which God in
Christ has mainifested to us."

       _DEAR CHRISTIANS, ONE AND ALL REJOICE._

       TRANSLATION in part from R. Massie.

FIRST MELODY, 1524. Harmony by H. Schein, 1627.

SECOND MELODY from Klug's Gesangbuch, 1543.  Harmony
by M. Praetorius, 1610. This choral is commonly known under
the title, "Es ist gewisslich an der Zeit," and, in a modified form,
in England and America, as "Luther's Judgment Hymn," from its
association with a hymn of W. B. Collyer, partly derived from the
German, and _not_ written by Luther.


II. - Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh' darein.

PSALM XII - Salvum me fac, Domine.

_LOOK DOWN, O LORD, FROM HEAVEN BEHOLD._

TRANSLATION chiefly from Frances Elizabeth Cox, in
"Hymns from the German."
FIRST MELODY, 1524, is the tune of the hymn of Paul Speratus,
"Es ist das Heil uns kommen her," the singing of which under
Luther's window at Wittenberg is related to have made so deep an
impression on the Reformer. The anecdote is confirmed by the fact
that in the "Eight Songs," Luther's three version of Psalms are all
set to this tune.. Harmony by A. Haupt, 1869.

SECOND MELODY from Klug's Gesangbuch, 1543. Harmony by
Haupt, 1869. This is the tune in common use with this psalm in
northern Germany.


III. - Es spricht der Unweisen Mund wohl.

PSALM XIV.-"Dixit insipiens in corde."

_THE MOUTH OF FOOLS DOTH GOD CONFESS._

TRANSLATION from R. Massie.

MELODY from Walter's Gesangbuch, 1525. Harmony by
M. Praetorius, 1610.

PSALM CXXX. - "De profundis clamavi."

_OUT OF THE DEEP I CRY TO THEE._

FIRST MELODY from Walter's Gesangbuch, 1525. Harmony by
John Sebastian Bach, about 1725.

SECOND MELODY in Wolfgang Koephl's Gesangbuch, 1537,
and in George Rhau's, 1544. Harmony by A. Haupt, 1869.


        FROM THE "ENCHIRIDION," Erfurt, 1524.


V. - Ein neues Lied wir heben an.

"A Song of the Two Christian Martyrs, burnt at Brussels by the
Sophists of Louvain. Which took place in the year 1522." [The
real date of the event was July 1, 1523; and the ballard gives every
token of having been inspired by the first announcement of the
story. The excellent translation of Mr. Massie has been conformed
more closely to the original in the third and fourth stanzas; also, by
a felicitous quatrain from the late Dr. C. T. Brooks, in the tenth
stanza.]

_BY HELP OF GOD I FAIN WOULD TELL._

TRANSLATION principally that of R. Massie.

MELODY in Walter's Gesangbuch, 1525. Harmony by
