one of the most competent writers on the subject, Professor Newcomb,
who is a mathematical astronomer, and not an easy theorist, evolving
the system of the universe from the depth of his own consciousness,
says: "Should any one be sceptical as to the sufficiency of these
laws to account for the present state of things, science can furnish
no evidence strong enough to overthrow his doubts until the sun
shall be found to be growing smaller by actual measurement, or the
nebulae be actually seen to condense into stars and systems." In
one of the most elaborate defences of the theory, it is argued that
the hypothesis explains why only one of the four planets nearest
the sun can have a moon, and why there can be no planet inside of
Mercury. The discovery of the two satellites to Mars and of the
planet Vulcan makes it all the worse for these facts.

Some of the objections to the theory should be known by every thinker.
Laplace must have the cloud "diffused in consequence of excessive
heat," etc. Helmholtz, in order to account for the heat of the
contracting sun, must have the cloud relatively cold. How he and
his followers diffused the cloud without heat is not stated.

The next difficulty is that of rotation. The laws [Page 186] of
science compel a contraction into one non-rotating body--a central
sun, indeed, but no planets about it. Laplace cleverly evades the
difficulty by not taking from the hand of the Creator diffused gas,
but a sun with an atmosphere filling space to the orbit of Neptune,
and _already in revolution_. He says: "It is four millions to one
that all motions of the planets, rotations and revolutions, were at
once imparted by an original common cause, of which we know neither
the nature nor the epoch." Helmholtz says of rotation, "the
existence of which must be assumed." Professor Newcomb says that the
planets would not be arranged as now, each one twice as far from the
sun as the next interior one, and the outer ones made first, but
that all would be made into planets at once, and the small inner
ones quite likely to cool off more rapidly.

It is a very serious difficulty that at least one satellite does
not revolve in the right direction. How Neptune or Uranus could
throw their moons backward from its equator is not easily accounted
for. It is at least one Parthian arrow at the system, not necessarily
fatal, but certainly dangerous.

A greater difficulty is presented by the recently discovered satellites
of Mars. The inner one goes round the planet in one-third part of
the time of the latter's revolution. How Mars could impart three
times the speed to a body flying off its surface that it has itself,
has caused several defenders of the hypothesis to rush forward
with explanations, but none with anything more than mere imaginary
collisions with some comet. It is to be noticed that accounting for
three times the speed is not enough; for as Mars shrunk away from
the [Page 187] ring that formed that satellite, it ought itself to
attain more speed, as the sun revolves faster than its planets, and
the earth faster than its moon. In defending the hypothesis, Mitchel
said: "Suppose we had discovered that it required more time for
Saturn or Jupiter to rotate on their axes than for their nearest
moon to revolve round them in its orbit; this would have falsified
the theory." It is also asserted that the newly discovered planet
Vulcan makes an orbital in less time than the sun makes an axial
revolution.

In regard to one Martial moon, Professor Kirkwood, on whom Proctor
conferred the highest title that could be conferred, "the modern
Kepler," says: "Unless some explanation can be given, the short period
of the inner satellite will be doubtless regarded as a conclusive
argument against the nebular hypothesis." If gravitation be sufficient
to account for the various motions of the heavenly bodies, we have
a perplexing problem in the star known as 1830 Groombridge, now
in the Hunting Dogs of Bootes. It is thought to have a speed of
two hundred miles per second--a velocity that all the known matter
in the universe could not give to the star by all its combined
attraction. Neither could all that attraction stop the motion of
the star, or bend it into an orbit. Its motion must be accounted
for on some hypothesis other than the nebular.

The nebulae which we are able to observe are not altogether confirmatory
of the hypothesis under consideration. They have the most fantastic
shapes, as if they had no relation to rotating suns in the formative
stages. There are vast gaps in the middle, where they ought to be
densest. Mr. Plumer, in the _Natural Science Review_, [Page 188]
says, in regard to the results of the spectroscopic revelations: "We
are furnished with distinct proof that the gases so examined are not
only of nearly equal density, but that they exist in a low state of
_tension. This fact is fatal to the nebular theory._"

In the autumn of 1876 a star blazed out in Cygnus, which promised
to throw a flood of light on the question of world-making. Its
spectrum was like some of the fixed stars. It probably blazed ont
by condensation from some previously invisible nebula. But its
brilliancy diminished swiftly, when it ought to have taken millions
of years to cool. If the theory was true, it ought to have behaved
very differently. It should have regularly condensed from gas to a
solid sun by slow process. But, worst of all, after being a star
awhile, it showed unmistakable proofs of turning into a cloud-mist--a
star into a nebula, instead of _vice versa_. A possible explanation
will be considered under variable stars.

Such are a few of the many difficulties in the way of accepting
the nebular hypothesis, as at present explained, as being the true
mode of development of the solar system. Doubtless it has come
from a hot and diffused condition into its present state; but when
such men as Proctor, Newcomb, and Kirkwood see difficulties that
cannot be explained, contradictions that cannot be reconciled by
the principles of this theory, surely lesser men are obliged to
suspend judgment, and render the Scotch verdict of "not proven."
Whatever truth there may be in the theory will survive, and be
incorporated into the final solution of the problem; which solution
will be a much grander generalization of the human mind than the
nebular hypothesis.

[Page 189]
Of some things we feel very sure: that matter was once without
form and void, and darkness rested on the face of the mighty deeps;
that, instead of chaos, we have now cosmos and beauty; and that
there is some process by which matter has been brought from one
state to the other. Whether, however, the nebular hypothesis lays
down the road travelled to this transfiguration, we are not sure.
Some of it seems like solid rock, and some like shifting quicksand.
Doubtless there is a road from that chaos to this fair cosmos.
The nebular hypothesis has surveyed, worked, and perfected many
long reaches of this road, but the rivers are not bridged, the
chasms not filled, nor the mountains tunnelled.

When men attempt to roll the hypothesis of evolution along the
road of the nebular hypothesis of worlds, and even beyond to the
production of vegetable and animal life, mind and affection, the
gaps in the road become evident, and disastrous.

A soul that has reached an adoration for the Supreme Father cares
not how he has made him. Doubtless the way God chose was the best.
It is as agreeable to have been thought of and provided for in the
beginning, to have had a myriad ages of care, and to have come
from the highest existent life at last, as to have been made at
once, by a single act, out of dust. The one who is made is not to
say to the Maker, "Why hast thou formed me in this or that manner?"
We only wish the question answered in what manner we were really
made.

Evolution, without constant superintendence and occasional new
inspiration of power, finds some tremendous chasms in the road
it travels. These must be spanned by the power of a present God
or the airy imagination [Page 190] of man. Dr. McCosh has happily
enumerated some of these tremendous gaps over which mere force
cannot go. Given, then, matter with mechanical power only, what are
the gaps between it and spirituality?

"1. Chemical action cannot be produced by mechanical power.

"2. Life, even in the lowest forms, cannot be produced from unorganized
matter.

"3. Protoplasm can be produced only by living matter.

"4. Organized matter is made up of cells, and can be produced only
by cells. Whence the first cell?

"5. A living being can be produced only from a seed or germ. Whence
the first vegetable seed?

"6. An animal cannot be produced from a plant. Whence the first
animal?

"7. Sensation cannot be produced in insentient matter.

"8. The genesis of a new species of plant or animal has never come
under the cognizance of man, either in pre-human or post-human ages,
either in pre-scientific or scientific times. Darwin acknowledges
this, and says that, should a new species suddenly arise, we have
no means of knowing that it is such.

"9. Consciousness--that is, a knowledge of self and its
operations--cannot be produced out of mere matter or sensation.

"10. We have no knowledge of man being generated out of the lower
animals.

"11. All human beings, even savages, are capable of forming certain
high ideas, such as those of God and duty. The brute creatures
cannot be made to entertain these by any training.

[Page 191]
"With such tremendous gaps in the process, the theory which would
derive all things out of matter by development is seen to be a
very precarious one.

The truth, according to the best judgment to be formed in the present
state of knowledge, would seem to be about this: The nebular hypothesis
is correct in all the main facts on which it is based; but that neither
the present forces of matter, nor any other forces conceivable to
the mind of man, with which it can possibly be endowed, can account
for all the facts already observed. There is a demand for a personal
volition, for an exercise of intelligence, for the following of a
divine plan that embraces a final perfection through various and
changeful processes. The five great classes of facts that sustain
the nebular hypothesis seem set before us to show the regular order
of working. The several facts that will not, so far as at present
known, accord with that plan, seem to be set before us to declare
the presence of a divine will and power working his good pleasure
according to the exigencies of time and place.

THE STELLAR SYSTEM.

"The heavens number out the glory of the strong God."--DAVID.

[Page 194]
Richter says that "an angel once took a man and stripped him of
his flesh, and lifted him up into space to show him the glory of
the universe. When the flesh was taken away the man ceased to be
cowardly, and was ready to fly with the angel past galaxy after
galaxy, and infinity after infinity, and so man and angel passed
on, viewing the universe, until the sun was out of sight--until
our solar system appeared as a speck of light against the black
empyrean, and there was only darkness. And they looked onward,
and in the infinities of light before, a speck of light appeared,
and suddenly they were in the midst of rushing worlds. But they
passed beyond that system, and beyond system after system, and
infinity after infinity, until the human heart sank, and the man
cried out: 'End is there none of the universe of God?' The angel
strengthened the man by words of counsel and courage, and they flew
on again until worlds left behind them were out of sight, and specks
of light in advance were transformed, as they approached them, into
rushing systems; they moved over architraves of eternities, over
pillars of immensities, over architecture of galaxies, unspeakable in
dimensions and duration, and the human heart sank again and called
ont: 'End is there none of the universe of God?' And all the stars
echoed the question with amazement: 'End is there none of the universe
of God?' And this echo found no answer. They moved on again past
immensities of immensities, and eternities of eternities, until
in the dizziness of uncounted galaxies the human heart sank for
the last time, and called out: 'End is there none of the universe
of God?' And again all the stars repeated the question, and the
angel answered: 'End is there none of the universe of God. Lo,
also, there is no beginning.'"

_THE OPEN PAGE OF THE HEAVENS._

The Greeks set their mythological deities in the skies, and read
the revolving pictures as a starry poem. Not that they were the
first to set the blazonry of the stars as monuments of their thought;
we read certain allusions to stars and asterisms as far back as
the time of Job. And the Pleiades, Arcturus, and Orion are some of
the names used by Him who "calleth all the stars by their names,
in the greatness of his power." Homer and Hesiod, 750 B.C., allude
to a few stars and groups. The Arabians very early speak of the
Great Bear; but the Greeks completely nationalized the heavens.
They colonized the earth widely, but the heavens completely; and
nightly over them marched the grand procession of their apotheosized
divinities. There Hercules perpetually wrought his mighty labors
for the good of man; there flashed and faded the changeful star
Algol, as an eye in the head of the snaky-haired Medusa; over them
flew Pegasus, the winged horse of the poet, careering among the
stars; there the ship Argo, which had explored all strange seas
of earth, nightly sailed in the infinite realms of heaven; there
Perseus perpetually killed the sea-monster by celestial aid, and
perpetually won the chained Andromeda for his bride. Very evident
was their recognition of divine help: equally evident was [Page 196]
their assertion of human ability and dominion. They gathered the
illimitable stars, and put uncountable suns into the shape of the
Great Bear--the most colossal form of animal ferocity and
strength--across whose broad forehead imagination grows weary in
flying; but they did not fail to put behind him a representative of
themselves, who forever drives him around a sky that never sets--a
perpetual type that man's ambition and expectation correspond to
that which has always been revealed as the divine.

The heavens signify much higher power and wisdom to us; we retain the
old pictures and groupings for the convenience of finding individual
stars. It is enough for the astronomer that we speak of a star as
situated right ascension 13' 45", declination 88 deg. 40'. But for
most people, if not all, it is better to call it Polaris. So we
might speak of a lake in latitude 42 deg. 40', longitude 79 deg. 22', but
it would be clearer to most persons to say Chatauqua. For exact
location of a star, right ascension and declination must be given;
but for general indication its name or place in a constellation
is sufficiently exact. The heaven is rather indeterminably laid
out in irregular tracts, and the mythological names are preserved.
The brightest stars are then indicated in order by the letters of
the Greek alphabet--Alpha (a), Beta (b), Gamma (g), etc. After
these are exhausted, the Roman alphabet is used in the same manner,
and then numbers are resorted to; so that the famous star 61 Cygni
is the 111th star in brightness in that one constellation. An
acquaintance with the names, peculiarities, and movements of the
stars visible at different seasons of the year is an unceasing
source of pleasure. It [Page 197] is not vision alone that is
gratified, for one fine enough may hear the morning stars sing
together, and understand the speech that day uttereth unto day, and
the knowledge that night showeth unto night. One never can be alone
if he is familiarly acquainted with the stars. He rises early in the
summer morning, that he may see his winter friends; in winter, that
he may gladden himself with a sight of the summer stars. He hails
their successive rising as he does the coming of his personal
friends from beyond the sea. On the wide ocean he is commercing with
the skies, his rapt soul sitting in his eyes. Under the clear skies
of the East he hears God's voice speaking to him, as to Abraham, and
saying, "Look now toward the heavens, and tell the number of the
stars, if thou be able to number them."

A general acquaintance with the stars will be first attempted;
a more particular knowledge afterward. Fig. 67 (page 201) is a
map of the circumpolar region, which is in full view every clear
night. It revolves daily round Polaris, its central point. Toward
this star, the two end stars of the Great Dipper ever point, and
are in consequence called "the Pointers." The map may be held toward
the northern sky in such a position as the stars may happen to be.
The Great Bear, or Dipper, will be seen at nine o'clock in the
evening above the pole in April and May; west of the pole, the
Pointers downward, in July and August; close to the north horizon
in October and November; and east of the pole the Pointers highest,
in January and February. The names of such constantly visible stars
should be familiar. In order, from the end of the tail of the Great
Bear, we have Benetnasch ae, Mizar z, Little Alcor close to it,
[Page 198] Alioth, e Megrez, d at the junction, has been growing
dimmer for a century, Phad, g Dubhe and Merak. It is best to get
some facility at estimating distances in degrees. Dubhe and Merak,
"the Pointers," are five degrees apart. Eighteen degrees forward of
Dubhe is the Bear's nose; and three pairs of stars, fifteen degrees
apart, show the position of the Bear's three feet. Follow "the
Pointers" twenty-nine degrees from Dubhe, and we come to the
pole-star. This star is double, made of two suns, both appearing as
one to the naked eye. It is a test of an excellent three-inch
telescope to resolve it into two. Three stars beside it make the
curved-up handle of the Little Dipper of Ursa Minor. Between the two
Bears, thirteen degrees from Megrez, and eleven degrees from Mizar,
are two stars in the tail of the Dragon, which curves about to
appropriate all the stars not otherwise assigned. Follow a curve of
fifteen stars, doubling back to a quadrangle from five to three
degrees on a side, and thirty-five degrees from the pole, for his
head. His tongue runs out to a star four degrees in front. We shall
find, hereafter, that the foot of Hercules stands on this head. This
is the Dragon slain by Cadmus, and whose teeth produced such a crop
of sanguinary men.

The star Thuban was once the pole-star. In the year B.C. 2300 it
was ten times nearer the pole than Polaris is now. In the year
A.D. 2100 the pole will be within 30' of Polaris; in A.D. 7500,
it will be at a of Cepheus; in A.D. 13,500, within 7 deg. of Vega; in
A.D. 15,700, at the star in the tongue of Draco; in A.D. 23,000,
at Thuban; in A.D. 28,000, back to Polaris. This indicates no change
in the position of the dome [Page 199] of stars, but a change in the
direction of the axis of the earth pointing to these various places
as the cycles pass. As the earth goes round its orbit, the axis,
maintaining nearly the same direction, really points to every part
of a circle near the north star as large as the earth's orbit, that
is, 185,000,000 miles in diameter. But, as already shown, that
circle is too small to be discernible at our distance. The wide
circle of the pole through the ages is really made up of the
interlaced curves of the annual curves continued through 25,870
years. The stem of the spinning top wavers, describes a circle, and
finally falls; the axis of the spinning earth wavers, describes a
circle of nearly 28,000 years, and never falls.

The star g Draconis, also called Etanin, is famous in modern astronomy,
because observations on this star led to the discovery of the
_aberration of light_. If we held a glass tube perpendicularly out
of the window of a car at rest, when the rain was falling straight
down, we could see the drops pass directly through. Put the car
in motion, and the drops would seem to start toward us, and the
top of the tube must be bent forward, or the drops entering would
strike on the backside of the tube carried toward them. So our
telescopes are bent forward on the moving earth, to enable the
entered light to reach the eye-piece. Hence the star does not appear
just where it is. As the earth moves faster in some parts of its
orbit than others, this aberration is sometimes greater than at
others. It is fortunate that light moves with a uniform velocity,
or this difficult, problem would be still further complicated.
The displacement of a star from this course is about 20".43.

[Page 200]
On the side of Polaris, opposite to Ursa Major, is King Cepheus,
made of a few dim stars in the form of the letter K. Near by is
his brilliant wife Cassiopeia, sitting on her throne of state.
They were the graceless parents who chained their daughter to a
rock for the sea-monster to devour; but Perseus, swift with the
winged sandals of Mercury, terrible with his avenging sword, and
invincible with the severed head of Medusa, whose horrid aspect of
snaky hair and scaly body turned to stone every beholder, rescues
the maiden from chains, and leads her away by the bands of love.
Nothing could be more poetical than the life of Perseus. When he
went to destroy the dreadful Gorgon, Medusa, Pluto lent him his
helmet, which would make him invisible at will; Minerva loaned
her buckler, impenetrable, and polished like a mirror; Mercury
gave him a dagger of diamonds, and his winged sandals, which would
carry him through the air. Coming to the loathsome thing, he would
