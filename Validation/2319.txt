
"If poor Faith had only been decently dressed," lamented Miss Cornelia
again, "it wouldn't have been quite that bad. But that dress looked
dreadful, as she stood there upon the platform."

"It was clean, though, Mrs. Dr. dear," said Susan. "They ARE clean
children. They may be very heedless and reckless, Mrs. Dr. dear, and I
am not saying they are not, but they NEVER forget to wash behind their
ears."

"The idea of Faith forgetting what day was Sunday," persisted Miss
Cornelia. "She will grow up just as careless and impractical as her
father, believe ME. I suppose Carl would have known better if he hadn't
been sick. I don't know what was wrong with him, but I think it very
likely he had been eating those blueberries that grew in the graveyard.
No wonder they made him sick. If I was a Methodist I'd try to keep my
graveyard cleaned up at least."

"I am of the opinion that Carl only ate the sours that grow on the
dyke," said Susan hopefully. "I do not think ANY minister's son would
eat blueberries that grew on the graves of dead people. You know it
would not be so bad, Mrs. Dr. dear, to eat things that grew on the
dyke."

"The worst of last night's performance was the face Faith made made at
somebody in the congregation before she started in," said Miss Cornelia.
"Elder Clow declares she made it at him. And DID you hear that she was
seen riding on a pig to-day?"

"I saw her. Walter was with her. I gave him a little--a VERY
little--scolding about it. He did not say much, but he gave me the
impression that it had been his idea and that Faith was not to blame."

"I do not not believe THAT, Mrs. Dr. dear," cried Susan, up in arms.
"That is just Walter's way--to take the blame on himself. But you know
as well as I do, Mrs. Dr. dear, that that blessed child would never have
thought of riding on a pig, even if he does write poetry."

"Oh, there's no doubt the notion was hatched in Faith Meredith's brain,"
said Miss Cornelia. "And I don't say that I'm sorry that Amos Drew's old
pigs did get their come-uppance for once. But the minister's daughter!"

"AND the doctor's son!" said Anne, mimicking Miss Cornelia's tone. Then
she laughed. "Dear Miss Cornelia, they're only little children. And
you KNOW they've never yet done anything bad--they're just heedless and
impulsive--as I was myself once. They'll grow sedate and sober--as I've
done."

Miss Cornelia laughed, too.

"There are times, Anne dearie, when I know by your eyes that YOUR
soberness is put on like a garment and you're really aching to do
something wild and young again. Well, I feel encouraged. Somehow, a
talk with you always does have that effect on me. Now, when I go to
see Barbara Samson, it's just the opposite. She makes me feel that
everything's wrong and always will be. But of course living all your
life with a man like Joe Samson wouldn't be exactly cheering."

"It is a very strange thing to think that she married Joe Samson after
all her chances," remarked Susan. "She was much sought after when she
was a girl. She used to boast to me that she had twenty-one beaus and
Mr. Pethick."

"What was Mr. Pethick?"

"Well, he was a sort of hanger-on, Mrs. Dr. dear, but you could
not exactly call him a beau. He did not really have any intentions.
Twenty-one beaus--and me that never had one! But Barbara went through
the woods and picked up the crooked stick after all. And yet they say
her husband can make better baking powder biscuits than she can, and she
always gets him to make them when company comes to tea."

"Which reminds ME that I have company coming to tea to-morrow and I must
go home and set my bread," said Miss Cornelia. "Mary said she could set
it and no doubt she could. But while I live and move and have my being
_I_ set my own bread, believe me."

"How is Mary getting on?" asked Anne.

"I've no fault to find with Mary," said Miss Cornelia rather
gloomily. "She's getting some flesh on her bones and she's clean and
respectful--though there's more in her than _I_ can fathom. She's a sly
puss. If you dug for a thousand years you couldn't get to the bottom of
that child's mind, believe ME! As for work, I never saw anything like
her. She EATS it up. Mrs. Wiley may have been cruel to her, but folks
needn't say she made Mary work. Mary's a born worker. Sometimes I wonder
which will wear out first--her legs or her tongue. I don't have enough
to do to keep me out of mischief these days. I'll be real glad when
school opens, for then I'll have something to do again. Mary doesn't
want to go to school, but I put my foot down and said that go she must.
I shall NOT have the Methodists saying that I kept her out of school
while I lolled in idleness."



CHAPTER XIII. THE HOUSE ON THE HILL

There was a little unfailing spring, always icy cold and crystal pure,
in a certain birch-screened hollow of Rainbow Valley in the lower corner
near the marsh. Not a great many people knew of its existence. The manse
and Ingleside children knew, of course, as they knew everything else
about the magic valley. Occasionally they went there to get a drink,
and it figured in many of their plays as a fountain of old romance. Anne
knew of it and loved it because it somehow reminded her of the beloved
Dryad's Bubble at Green Gables. Rosemary West knew of it; it was her
fountain of romance, too. Eighteen years ago she had sat behind it one
spring twilight and heard young Martin Crawford stammer out a confession
of fervent, boyish love. She had whispered her own secret in return,
and they had kissed and promised by the wild wood spring. They had never
stood together by it again--Martin had sailed on his fatal voyage soon
after; but to Rosemary West it was always a sacred spot, hallowed by
that immortal hour of youth and love. Whenever she passed near it she
turned aside to hold a secret tryst with an old dream--a dream from
which the pain had long gone, leaving only its unforgettable sweetness.

The spring was a hidden thing. You might have passed within ten feet of
it and never have suspected its existence. Two generations past a huge
old pine had fallen almost across it. Nothing was left of the tree but
its crumbling trunk out of which the ferns grew thickly, making a green
roof and a lacy screen for the water. A maple-tree grew beside it with
a curiously gnarled and twisted trunk, creeping along the ground for
a little way before shooting up into the air, and so forming a quaint
seat; and September had flung a scarf of pale smoke-blue asters around
the hollow.

John Meredith, taking the cross-lots road through Rainbow Valley on
his way home from some pastoral visitations around the Harbour head one
evening, turned aside to drink of the little spring. Walter Blythe had
shown it to him one afternoon only a few days before, and they had had
a long talk together on the maple seat. John Meredith, under all his
shyness and aloofness, had the heart of a boy. He had been called Jack
in his youth, though nobody in Glen St. Mary would ever have believed
it. Walter and he had taken to each other and had talked unreservedly.
Mr. Meredith found his way into some sealed and sacred chambers of the
lad's soul wherein not even Di had ever looked. They were to be
chums from that friendly hour and Walter knew that he would never be
frightened of the minister again.

"I never believed before that it was possible to get really acquainted
with a minister," he told his mother that night.

John Meredith drank from his slender white hand, whose grip of steel
always surprised people who were unacquainted with it, and then sat down
on the maple seat. He was in no hurry to go home; this was a beautiful
spot and he was mentally weary after a round of rather uninspiring
conversations with many good and stupid people. The moon was rising.
Rainbow Valley was wind-haunted and star-sentinelled only where he was,
but afar from the upper end came the gay notes of children's laughter
and voices.

The ethereal beauty of the asters in the moonlight, the glimmer of the
little spring, the soft croon of the brook, the wavering grace of
the brackens all wove a white magic round John Meredith. He forgot
congregational worries and spiritual problems; the years slipped away
from him; he was a young divinity student again and the roses of June
were blooming red and fragrant on the dark, queenly head of his Cecilia.
He sat there and dreamed like any boy. And it was at this propitious
moment that Rosemary West stepped aside from the by-path and stood
beside him in that dangerous, spell-weaving place. John Meredith stood
up as she came in and saw her--REALLY saw her--for the first time.

He had met her in his church once or twice and shaken hands with her
abstractedly as he did with anyone he happened to encounter on his
way down the aisle. He had never met her elsewhere, for the Wests were
Episcopalians, with church affinities in Lowbridge, and no occasion for
calling upon them had ever arisen. Before to-night, if anyone had asked
John Meredith what Rosemary West looked like he would not have had the
slightest notion. But he was never to forget her, as she appeared to him
in the glamour of kind moonlight by the spring.

She was certainly not in the least like Cecilia, who had always been
his ideal of womanly beauty. Cecilia had been small and dark and
vivacious--Rosemary West was tall and fair and placid, yet John Meredith
thought he had never seen so beautiful a woman.

She was bareheaded and her golden hair--hair of a warm gold, "molasses
taffy" colour as Di Blythe had said--was pinned in sleek, close coils
over her head; she had large, tranquil, blue eyes that always seemed
full of friendliness, a high white forehead and a finely shaped face.

Rosemary West was always called a "sweet woman." She was so sweet that
even her high-bred, stately air had never gained for her the reputation
of being "stuck-up," which it would inevitably have done in the case
of anyone else in Glen St. Mary. Life had taught her to be brave, to
be patient, to love, to forgive. She had watched the ship on which
her lover went sailing out of Four Winds Harbour into the sunset. But,
though she watched long, she had never seen it coming sailing back.
That vigil had taken girlhood from her eyes, yet she kept her youth to
a marvellous degree. Perhaps this was because she always seemed to
preserve that attitude of delighted surprise towards life which most of
us leave behind in childhood--an attitude which not only made Rosemary
herself seem young, but flung a pleasing illusion of youth over the
consciousness of every one who talked to her.

John Meredith was startled by her loveliness and Rosemary was startled
by his presence. She had never thought she would find anyone by that
remote spring, least of all the recluse of Glen St. Mary manse. She
almost dropped the heavy armful of books she was carrying home from the
Glen lending library, and then, to cover her confusion, she told one of
those small fibs which even the best of women do tell at times.

"I--I came for a drink," she said, stammering a little, in answer to
Mr. Meredith's grave "good evening, Miss West." She felt that she was
an unpardonable goose and she longed to shake herself. But John Meredith
was not a vain man and he knew she would likely have been as much
startled had she met old Elder Clow in that unexpected fashion. Her
confusion put him at ease and he forgot to be shy; besides, even the
shyest of men can sometimes be quite audacious in moonlight.

"Let me get you a cup," he said smiling. There was a cup near by, if
he had only known it, a cracked, handleless blue cup secreted under
the maple by the Rainbow Valley children; but he did not know it, so he
stepped out to one of the birch-trees and stripped a bit of its white
skin away. Deftly he fashioned this into a three-cornered cup, filled it
from the spring, and handed it to Rosemary.

Rosemary took it and drank every drop to punish herself for her fib, for
she was not in the least thirsty, and to drink a fairly large cupful of
water when you are not thirsty is somewhat of an ordeal. Yet the memory
of that draught was to be very pleasant to Rosemary. In after years it
seemed to her that there was something sacramental about it. Perhaps
this was because of what the minister did when she handed him back the
cup. He stooped again and filled it and drank of it himself. It was only
by accident that he put his lips just where Rosemary had put hers, and
Rosemary knew it. Nevertheless, it had a curious significance for her.
They two had drunk of the same cup. She remembered idly that an old
aunt of hers used to say that when two people did this their after-lives
would be linked in some fashion, whether for good or ill.

John Meredith held the cup uncertainly. He did not know what to do with
it. The logical thing would have been to toss it away, but somehow he
was disinclined to do this. Rosemary held out her hand for it.

"Will you let me have it?" she said. "You made it so knackily. I never
saw anyone make a birch cup so since my little brother used to make them
long ago--before he died."

"I learned how to make them when _I_ was a boy, camping out one summer.
An old hunter taught me," said Mr. Meredith. "Let me carry your books,
Miss West."

Rosemary was startled into another fib and said oh, they were not heavy.
But the minister took them from her with quite a masterful air and they
walked away together. It was the first time Rosemary had stood by the
valley spring without thinking of Martin Crawford. The mystic tryst had
been broken.

The little by-path wound around the marsh and then struck up the long
wooded hill on the top of which Rosemary lived. Beyond, through the
trees, they could see the moonlight shining across the level summer
fields. But the little path was shadowy and narrow. Trees crowded
over it, and trees are never quite as friendly to human beings after
nightfall as they are in daylight. They wrap themselves away from us.
They whisper and plot furtively. If they reach out a hand to us it has
a hostile, tentative touch. People walking amid trees after night
always draw closer together instinctively and involuntarily, making an
alliance, physical and mental, against certain alien powers around them.
Rosemary's dress brushed against John Meredith as they walked. Not even
an absent-minded minister, who was after all a young man still, though
he firmly believed he had outlived romance, could be insensible to the
charm of the night and the path and the companion.

It is never quite safe to think we have done with life. When we imagine
we have finished our story fate has a trick of turning the page and
showing us yet another chapter. These two people each thought their
hearts belonged irrevocably to the past; but they both found their walk
up that hill very pleasant. Rosemary thought the Glen minister was by
no means as shy and tongue-tied as he had been represented. He seemed to
find no difficulty in talking easily and freely. Glen housewives would
have been amazed had they heard him. But then so many Glen housewives
talked only gossip and the price of eggs, and John Meredith was not
interested in either. He talked to Rosemary of books and music and
wide-world doings and something of his own history, and found that she
could understand and respond. Rosemary, it appeared, possessed a book
which Mr. Meredith had not read and wished to read. She offered to lend
it to him and when they reached the old homestead on the hill he went in
to get it.

The house itself was an old-fashioned gray one, hung with vines, through
which the light in the sitting-room winked in friendly fashion. It
looked down the Glen, over the harbour, silvered in the moonlight, to
the sand-dunes and the moaning ocean. They walked in through a garden
that always seemed to smell of roses, even when no roses were in bloom.
There was a sisterhood of lilies at the gate and a ribbon of asters on
either side of the broad walk, and a lacery of fir trees on the hill's
edge beyond the house.

"You have the whole world at your doorstep here," said John Meredith,
with a long breath. "What a view--what an outlook! At times I feel
stifled down there in the Glen. You can breathe up here."

"It is calm to-night," said Rosemary laughing. "If there were a wind it
would blow your breath away. We get 'a' the airts the wind can blow' up
here. This place should be called Four Winds instead of the Harbour."

"I like wind," he said. "A day when there is no wind seems to me DEAD. A
windy day wakes me up." He gave a conscious laugh. "On a calm day I fall
into day dreams. No doubt you know my reputation, Miss West. If I cut
you dead the next time we meet don't put it down to bad manners. Please
understand that it is only abstraction and forgive me--and speak to me."

They found Ellen West in the sitting room when they went in. She laid
her glasses down on the book she had been reading and looked at them
in amazement tinctured with something else. But she shook hands amiably
with Mr. Meredith and he sat down and talked to her, while Rosemary
hunted out his book.

Ellen West was ten years older than Rosemary, and so different from her
