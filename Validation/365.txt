the man chosen by Ningirsu to carry out his commands. Here it is the
sign which confirms the apparent meaning of the god's words. And Gudea
was at last content and built the temple.(2)

     (1) Cyl. A., col. xii, l. 10 f.; cf. Thureau-Dangin, op.
     cit., p. 150 f., Germ. ed., p. 102 f. The word translated
     "side" may also be rendered as "hand"; but "side" is the
     more probable rendering of the two. The touching of Gudea's
     side (or hand) presents an interesting resemblance to the
     touching of Jacob's thigh by the divine wrestler at Peniel
     in Gen. xxxii. 24 ff. (J or JE). Given a belief in the
     constant presence of the unseen and its frequent
     manifestation, such a story as that of Peniel might well
     arise from an unexplained injury to the sciatic muscle,
     while more than one ailment of the heart or liver might
     perhaps suggest the touch of a beckoning god. There is of
     course no connexion between the Sumerian and Hebrew stories
     beyond their common background. It may be added that those
     critics who would reverse the _roles_ of Jacob and the
     wrestler miss the point of the Hebrew story.

     (2) Even so, before starting on the work, he took the
     further precautions of ascertaining that the omens were
     favourable and of purifying his city from all malign
     influence.

We may conclude, then, that in the new Sumerian Version of the Deluge we
have traced a logical connexion between the direct warning to Ziusudu in
the Fourth Column of the text and the reference to a dream in the broken
lines at the close of the Third Column. As in the Gilgamesh Epic and
in Berossus, here too the god's warning is conveyed in a dream; and
the accompanying reference to conjuring by the Name of Heaven and Earth
probably represents the means by which Ziusudu was enabled to verify its
apparent meaning. The assurance which Gudea obtained through the priest
of Nina and the sign, the priest-king Ziusudu secured by his own act,
in virtue of his piety and practice of divination. And his employment of
the particular class of incantation referred to, that which conjures by
the Name of Heaven and Earth, is singularly appropriate to the context.
For by its use he was enabled to test the meaning of Enki's words, which
related to the intentions of Anu and Enlil, the gods respectively of
Heaven and of Earth. The symbolical setting of Gudea's vision also finds
a parallel in the reed-house and wall of the Deluge story, though in the
latter case we have not the benefit of interpretation by a goddess. In
the Sumerian Version the wall is merely part of the vision and does
not receive a direct address from the god. That appears as a later
development in the Semitic Version, and it may perhaps have suggested
the excuse, put in that version into the mouth of Ea, that he had not
directly revealed the decision of the gods.(1)

     (1) In that case the parallel suggested by Sir James Frazer
     between the reed-house and wall of the Gilgamesh Epic, now
     regarded as a medium of communication, and the whispering
     reeds of the Midas story would still hold good.

The omission of any reference to a dream before the warning in the
Gilgamesh Epic may be accounted for on the assumption that readers of
the poem would naturally suppose that the usual method of divine warning
was implied; and the text does indicate that the warning took place at
night, for Gilgamesh proceeds to carry out the divine instructions at
the break of day. The direct warning of the Hebrew Versions, on the
other hand, does not carry this implication, since according to Hebrew
ideas direct speech, as well as vision, was included among the methods
by which the divine will could be conveyed to man.




V. THE FLOOD, THE ESCAPE OF THE GREAT BOAT, AND THE SACRIFICE TO THE
SUN-GOD

The missing portion of the Fourth Column must have described Ziusudu's
building of his great boat in order to escape the Deluge, for at the
beginning of the Fifth Column we are in the middle of the Deluge itself.
The column begins:

     All the mighty wind-storms together blew,
     The flood . . . raged.
     When for seven days, for seven nights,
     The flood had overwhelmed the land
     When the wind-storm had driven the great boat over the mighty
     waters,
     The Sun-god came forth, shedding light over heaven and earth.
     Ziusudu opened the opening of the great boat;
     The light of the hero, the Sun-god, (he) causes to enter into the
     interior(?) of the great boat.
     Ziusudu, the king,
     Bows himself down before the Sun-god;
     The king sacrifices an ox, a sheep he slaughters(?).

The connected text of the column then breaks off, only a sign or two
remaining of the following half-dozen lines. It will be seen that in the
eleven lines that are preserved we have several close parallels to
the Babylonian Version and some equally striking differences. While
attempting to define the latter, it will be well to point out how close
the resemblances are, and at the same time to draw a comparison between
the Sumerian and Babylonian Versions of this part of the story and the
corresponding Hebrew accounts.

Here, as in the Babylonian Version, the Flood is accompanied by
hurricanes of wind, though in the latter the description is worked up
in considerable detail. We there read(1) that at the appointed time the
ruler of the darkness at eventide sent a heavy rain. Ut-napishtim saw
its beginning, but fearing to watch the storm, he entered the interior
of the ship by Ea's instructions, closed the door, and handed over the
direction of the vessel to the pilot Puzur-Amurri. Later a thunder-storm
and hurricane added their terrors to the deluge. For at early dawn a
black cloud came up from the horizon, Adad the Storm-god thundering in
its midst, and his heralds, Nabu and Sharru, flying over mountain and
plain. Nergal tore away the ship's anchor, while Ninib directed the
storm; the Anunnaki carried their lightning-torches and lit up the
land with their brightness; the whirlwind of the Storm-god reached the
heavens, and all light was turned into darkness. The storm raged the
whole day, covering mountain and people with water.(2) No man beheld his
fellow; the gods themselves were afraid, so that they retreated into
the highest heaven, where they crouched down, cowering like dogs. Then
follows the lamentation of Ishtar, to which reference has already been
made, the goddess reproaching herself for the part she had taken in the
destruction of her people. This section of the Semitic narrative closes
with the picture of the gods weeping with her, sitting bowed down with
their lips pressed together.

     (1) Gilg. Epic, XI, ll. 90 ff.

     (2) In the Atrakhasis version, dated in the reign of
     Ammizaduga, Col. I, l. 5, contains a reference to the "cry"
     of men when Adad the Storm-god, slays them with his flood.

It is probable that the Sumerian Version, in the missing portion of its
Fourth Column, contained some account of Ziusudu's entry into his
boat; and this may have been preceded, as in the Gilgamesh Epic, by a
reference to "the living seed of every kind", or at any rate to "the
four-legged creatures of the field", and to his personal possessions,
with which we may assume he had previously loaded it. But in the Fifth
Column we have no mention of the pilot or of any other companions who
may have accompanied the king; and we shall see that the Sixth Column
contains no reference to Ziusudu's wife. The description of the storm
may have begun with the closing lines of the Fourth Column, though it
is also quite possible that the first line of the Fifth Column actually
begins the account. However that may be, and in spite of the poetic
imagery of the Semitic Babylonian narrative, the general character of
the catastrophe is the same in both versions.

We find an equally close parallel, between the Sumerian and Babylonian
accounts, in the duration of the storm which accompanied the Flood, as
will be seen by printing the two versions together:(3)

     SUMERIAN VERSION                    SEMITIC VERSION

     When for seven days, for seven   For six days and nights
     nights,
     The flood had overwhelmed the    The wind blew, the flood, the
     land,                            tempest overwhelmed the land.

     the great boat over the          the tempest, the flood, ceased

     In which it had fought like a
     host.
     The Sun-god came forth shedding  Then the sea rested and was
     light over heaven and earth.     still, and the wind-storm, the
     flood, ceased.

     (3) Col. V, ll. 3-6 are here compared with Gilg. Epic, XI,
     ll. 128-32.

The two narratives do not precisely agree as to the duration of the
storm, for while in the Sumerian account the storm lasts seven days and
seven nights, in the Semitic-Babylonian Version it lasts only six days
and nights, ceasing at dawn on the seventh day. The difference, however,
is immaterial when we compare these estimates with those of the Hebrew
Versions, the older of which speaks of forty days' rain, while the later
version represents the Flood as rising for no less than a hundred and
fifty days.

The close parallel between the Sumerian and Babylonian Versions is not,
however, confined to subject-matter, but here, even extends to some
of the words and phrases employed. It has already been noted that
the Sumerian term employed for "flood" or "deluge" is the attested
equivalent of the Semitic word; and it may now be added that the word
which may be rendered "great boat" or "great ship" in the Sumerian text
is the same word, though partly expressed by variant characters, which
occurs in the early Semitic fragment of the Deluge story from Nippur.(1)
In the Gilgamesh Epic, on the other hand, the ordinary ideogram for
"vessel" or "ship"(2) is employed, though the great size of the vessel
is there indicated, as in Berossus and the later Hebrew Version, by
detailed measurements. Moreover, the Sumerian and Semitic verbs,
which are employed in the parallel passages quoted above for the
"overwhelming" of the land, are given as synonyms in a late syllabary,
while in another explanatory text the Sumerian verb is explained as
applying to the destructive action of a flood.(3) Such close linguistic
parallels are instructive as furnishing additional proof, if it were
needed, of the dependence of the Semitic-Babylonian and Assyrian
Versions upon Sumerian originals.

     (1) The Sumerian word is _(gish)ma-gur-gur_, corresponding
     to the term written in the early Semitic fragment, l. 8, as
     _(isu)ma-gur-gur_, which is probably to be read under its
     Semitized form _magurgurru_. In l. 6 of that fragment the
     vessel is referred to under the synonymous expression
     _(isu)elippu ra-be-tu_, "a great ship".

     (2) i.e. (GISH)MA, the first element in the Sumerian word,
     read in Semitic Babylonian as _elippu_, "ship"; when
     employed in the early Semitic fragment it is qualified by
     the adj. _ra-be-tu_, "great". There is no justification for
     assuming, with Prof. Hilbrecht, that a measurement of the
     vessel was given in l. 7 of the early Semitic fragment.

     (3) The Sumerian verb _ur_, which is employed in l. 2 of the
     Fifth Column in the expression _ba-an-da-ab-ur-ur_,
     translated as "raged", occurs again in l. 4 in the phrase
     _kalam-ma ba-ur-ra_, "had overwhelmed the land". That we are
     justified in regarding the latter phrase as the original of
     the Semitic _i-sap-pan mata_ (Gilg. Epic, XI, l. 129) is
     proved by the equation Sum. _ur-ur_ = Sem. _sa-pa-nu_
     (Rawlinson, _W.A.I._, Vol. V, pl. 42, l. 54 c) and by the
     explanation Sum. _ur-ur_ = Sem. _sa-ba-tu sa a-bu-bi_, i.e.
     "_ur-ur_ = to smite, of a flood" (_Cun. Texts_, Pt. XII, pl.
     50, Obv., l. 23); cf. Poebel, _Hist. Texts_, p. 54, n. 1.

It may be worth while to pause for a moment in our study of the text, in
order to inquire what kind of boat it was in which Ziusudu escaped the
Flood. It is only called "a great boat" or "a great ship" in the
text, and this term, as we have noted, was taken over, semitized, and
literally translated in an early Semitic-Babylonian Version. But the
Gilgamesh Epic, representing the later Semitic-Babylonian Version,
supplies fuller details, which have not, however, been satisfactorily
explained. Either the obvious meaning of the description and figures
there given has been ignored, or the measurements have been applied to
a central structure placed upon a hull, much on the lines of a
modern "house-boat" or the conventional Noah's ark.(1) For the latter
interpretation the text itself affords no justification. The statement
is definitely made that the length and breadth of the vessel itself are
to be the same;(2) and a later passage gives ten _gar_ for the height of
its sides and ten _gar_ for the breadth of its deck.(3) This description
has been taken to imply a square box-like structure, which, in order to
be seaworthy, must be placed on a conjectured hull.

     (1) Cf., e.g., Jastrow, _Hebr. and Bab. Trad._, p. 329.

     (2) Gilg. Epic, XI, ll. 28-30.

     (3) L. 58 f. The _gar_ contained twelve cubits, so that the
     vessel would have measured 120 cubits each way; taking the
     Babylonian cubit, on the basis of Gudea's scale, at 495 mm.
     (cf. Thureau-Dangin, _Journal Asiatique_, Dix. Ser., t.
     XIII, 1909, pp. 79 ff., 97), this would give a length,
     breadth, and height of nearly 195 ft.

I do not think it has been noted in this connexion that a vessel,
approximately with the relative proportions of that described in the
Gilgamesh Epic, is in constant use to-day on the lower Tigris and
Euphrates. A _kuffah_,(1) the familiar pitched coracle of Baghdad, would
provide an admirable model for the gigantic vessel in which Ut-napishtim
rode out the Deluge. "Without either stem or stern, quite round like a
shield"--so Herodotus described the _kuffah_ of his day;2() so, too, is
it represented on Assyrian slabs from Nineveh, where we see it employed
for the transport of heavy building material;(3) its form and structure
indeed suggest a prehistoric origin. The _kuffah_ is one of those
examples of perfect adjustment to conditions of use which cannot be
improved. Any one who has travelled in one of these craft will agree
that their storage capacity is immense, for their circular form and
steeply curved side allow every inch of space to be utilized. It is
almost impossible to upset them, and their only disadvantage is lack
of speed. For their guidance all that is required is a steersman with a
paddle, as indicated in the Epic. It is true that the larger kuffah of
to-day tends to increase in diameter as compared to height, but
that detail might well be ignored in picturing the monster vessel
of Ut-napishtim. Its seven horizontal stages and their nine lateral
divisions would have been structurally sound in supporting the vessel's
sides; and the selection of the latter uneven number, though prompted
doubtless by its sacred character, is only suitable to a circular craft
in which the interior walls would radiate from the centre. The use of
pitch and bitumen for smearing the vessel inside and out, though unusual
even in Mesopotamian shipbuilding, is precisely the method employed in
the _kuffah's_ construction.

     (1) Arab. _kuffah_, pl. _kufaf_; in addition to its common
     use for the Baghdad coracle, the word is also employed for a
     large basket.

     (2) Herodotus, I, 194.

     (3) The _kuffah_ is formed of wicker-work coated with
     bitumen. Some of those represented on the Nineveh sculptures
     appear to be covered with skins; and Herodotus (I, 94)
     states that "the boats which come down the river to Babylon
     are circular and made of skins." But his further description
     shows that he is here referred to the _kelek_ or skin-raft,
     with which he has combined a description of the _kuffah_.
     The late Sir Henry Rawlinson has never seen or heard of a
     skin-covered _kuffah_ on either the Tigris or Euphrates, and
     there can be little doubt that bitumen was employed for
     their construction in antiquity, as it is to-day. These
     craft are often large enough to carry five or six horses and
     a dozen men.

We have no detailed description of Ziusudu's "great boat", beyond the
fact that it was covered in and had an opening, or light-hole, which
could be closed. But the form of Ut-napishtim's vessel was no doubt
traditional, and we may picture that of Ziusudu as also of the _kuffah_
type, though smaller and without its successor's elaborate internal
structure. The gradual development of the huge coracle into a ship would
have been encouraged by the Semitic use of the term "ship" to describe
it; and the attempt to retain something of its original proportions
resulted in producing the unwieldy ark of later tradition.(1)

     (1) The description of the ark is not preserved from the
     earlier Hebrew Version (J), but the latter Hebrew Version
     (P), while increasing the length of the vessel, has
     considerably reduced its height and breadth. Its
     measurements are there given (Gen. vi. 15) as 300 cubits in
     length, 50 cubits in breadth, and 30 cubits in height;
     taking the ordinary Hebrew cubit at about 18 in., this would
     give a length of about 450 ft., a breadth of about 75 ft.,
     and a height of about 45 ft. The interior stories are
     necessarily reduced to three. The vessel in Berossus
     measures five stadia by two, and thus had a length of over
     three thousand feet and a breadth of more than twelve
     hundred.

We will now return to the text and resume the comparison we were making
between it and the Gilgamesh Epic. In the latter no direct reference
is made to the appearance of the Sun-god after the storm, nor is
Ut-napishtim represented as praying to him. But the sequence of events
in the Sumerian Version is very natural, and on that account alone,
apart from other reasons, it may be held to represent the original
form of the story. For the Sun-god would naturally reappear after the
darkness of the storm had passed, and it would be equally natural that
Ziusudu should address himself to the great light-god. Moreover, the
Gilgamesh Epic still retains traces of the Sumerian Version, as will be
seen from a comparison of their narratives,(1) the Semitic Version being
quoted from the point where the hurricane ceased and the sea became
still.

     (1) Col. V, ll. 7-11 are here compared with Gilg. Epic, XI,
     ll. 133-9.
