brother's boat."

"Steep as it may seem, you can't go," added Mr. Sherwood firmly.

"Can't I go, Lawry?" continued Ben.

"It is not for him to say. I have engaged this boat for my party to-day,
and, beyond his crew, it is not for him to say who shall go."

"I'm going, anyhow," replied Ben stubbornly.

"No, you are not."

"Yes, I am! if you want to fight, I'm all ready."

"Young man, you wanted to be captain of this boat; you have made a
mistake."

"No, I haven't. You and Lawry can't make a nobody out of me."

"You will do it yourself."

"You see."

"Will you go on shore?"

"No, I won't."

The sheriff stood on the wharf with Mrs. Wilford, waiting to see the
departure of the _Woodville_. Ben's mother begged him to come on
shore; but he was in that frame of mind which seemed to make
opposition a necessity to him. "Do you want any assistance, Mr.
Sherwood?" asked the sheriff, as he stepped on deck.

The reckless young man would have been very glad to have Mr.
Sherwood put his hand upon him, for it would have afforded him an
opportunity to revenge himself for his disappointment. It was another
thing to raise his hand against an officer of the law, and he
sullenly walked up the gangplank when that formidable individual
intimated his readiness to relieve the boat of her unwelcome passenger.

"Haul in the plank, and cast off the bow-line," said Lawry.

He rang the bell to back her, and when her bow pointed out from the
shore, the stern-line was cast off, and she moved slowly away from
the wharf.

"I'm sorry your brother behaves so badly, Lawry," said Mr. Sherwood,
after the steamer started.

"It makes me sick to think of it, sir," replied the pilot. "I'm
really afraid of him, for I don't know what he will do next."

"Do your duty, faithfully; that is all you need do."

"I feel almost sorry I didn't let him be captain, when I think the
matter over."

"He is not fit to be captain; and you did quite right in not
consenting to it. I'm sorry for you, Lawry, and sorry for your
mother, for he must be a sore trial to both of you."

"If he wasn't my brother I wouldn't care," added Lawry, restraining
the tears.

"Never mind it, my boy; we won't say anything more about it. Let us
hope your brother will grow better."

"I hope he will, sir."

The _Woodville_ was now going at full speed up the lake. The
party on board consisted of twenty-four ladies and gentlemen, most of
whom were summer visitors at Port Rock. They were delighted with the
beautiful little craft, and glad to know that she could be obtained
for pleasure-parties during the summer. They wandered about the deck,
saloon, and cabin till they had examined every part of her, and then
they gave themselves up to the enjoyment of the sail, and of the
magnificent scenery on the borders of the lake. They seated
themselves on the forward deck, and Lawry pointed out the objects of
interest as the steamer proceeded; and in this occupation he forgot
the conduct of Ben, and was as happy as the happiest of the party
before him. The ladies and gentlemen sang songs and psalm tunes, in
which the sweet voice of Fanny Jane Grant was so prominent that Ethan
was once enticed from the fascinating engine which occupied all his
thoughts.

In the meantime, Mrs. Light was busy with the dinner. Captain Lawry
was a little uneasy on this subject, for it was out of his line of
business. In the middle of the forenoon he gave the wheel to one of
the deck-hands, and went down into the kitchen to satisfy himself
that this important matter was receiving due attention. The cook was
so confident and enthusiastic that he was quite sure she would
realize the expectations of the passengers. In the cabin he found the
girls busy at the tables. Both of them had seen service in hotels,
and there was no danger of a failure in their department. At one
o'clock dinner was on the table, and the young captain went down
again to assure himself that it was all right.

"Come, Lawry, can't you dine with us?" said Mr. Sherwood, when the
bell had been rung.

"I can't leave the wheel, sir."

"But don't you want some dinner?"

"I'll have my dinner when we get to Whitehall. Haste makes waste,
you know; and if I should be in a hurry to eat my dinner we might get
aground, or be smashed up on the rocks."

"I suppose you are right, Lawry, and I will do the honors of the
table for you," laughed Mr. Sherwood.

The dinner was not only satisfactory, but it was warmly praised; and
Mrs. Light was made as happy as the captain by the enthusiastic
encomiums bestowed upon her taste and skill in the culinary art.

The _Woodville_ reached Whitehall at two o'clock, where the
party went on shore to spend an hour. While they were absent Lawry
and all hands had their dinner, the cabins and the deck were swept,
and everything put in order. Quite a number of people visited the
little steamer while she lay at the pier; and a gentleman engaged her
to take out a party the next Saturday, with dinner for twenty-four
persons. When Mr. Sherwood returned, he had let her for another day.

At three o'clock the _Woodville_ started for Port Rock. The
party were still in high spirits, and the singing was resumed when
the wheels began to turn. On the way down, she stopped at
Ticonderoga, while her appearance so delighted a party of
pleasure-seekers that she was engaged for another day, and a dinner
for twenty spoken for.

"Lawry, you must have an engagement-book, or you will forget some of
your parties," said Mr. Sherwood, who stood by the pilot, in the
wheel-house, when the steamer started.

"I have put them all down on a piece of paper, sir. I will get a
book when I go to Burlington."

"Which will be to-morrow. I had engaged her for four days when you
came up with her from Port Henry; but I'm afraid we shall work you
too hard."

"No fear of that, sir. I only hope I shall be able to pay you that
money you advanced this morning."

"Don't say a word about that. Let me see: you are engaged in
Burlington to-morrow, to me the next day, and in Whitehall on the
following day."

"I will get a book and put them down, sir."

"But you must be in Burlington by eight o'clock tomorrow morning."

"We can run up to-night."

"You will get no sleep if you run all night."

"I think we shall want another fireman."

"You will: for in order to keep your engagements you will
occasionally have to run nights."

At eight o'clock the _Woodville_ landed her passengers at Port
Rock, and as the gentlemen went ashore, they gave three cheers for
the little steamer and her little captain.




CHAPTER XVII

BURLINGTON TO ISLE LA MOTTE


On his way home, Mr. Sherwood went to the ferry-house and satisfied
himself that the mortgage on the place had been canceled. Mrs.
Wilford was profuse in the expression of her gratitude to him for his
kindness to the family, and hoped that Lawry and his father would be
able to pay him back the whole sum.

"Mrs. Wilford, so far as gratitude and obligation are concerned, the
balance is still largely against me. Millions of dollars would not
pay the debt I owe to your son."

"Oh, Lawry don't think anything of that, sir!"

"But I do. Madam, if your son had been five minutes later than he
was when the little steamer went down, Miss Fanny Grant would
certainly have been drowned, and my wife would doubtless have shared
her fate. And when I think that this exposure of their precious lives
was my own fault; that my wife and her sister had nearly perished by
my foolish haste and recklessness, I feel like giving every dollar I
have in the world to Lawry. You don't understand this matter as I do,
Mrs. Wilford."

"I didn't think you were in any great danger."

"Miss Fanny would certainly have been drowned; and I don't think it
would have been possible for me to save my wife, for I was nearly
exhausted when Lawry came. Now, Mrs. Wilford, do you suppose I shall
mind one, two, or ten thousand dollars, where my brave deliverer is
concerned? In one word, I will never take a dollar which I have
expended for Lawry or the family. Your son is a manly and independent
boy, and I don't like to hurt his feelings; so I shall not say
anything about this money at present."

"Lawry is a good boy," said Mrs. Wilford proudly.

"He is worth his weight in gold. I am sorry your oldest son is not
more like him."

"I don't know what to think of Benjamin."

"Where is he now?"

"I don't know; I haven't seen him since the steamer left, this
morning."

"Lawry is a good deal troubled about the ferry-boat."

"He needn't be."

"Can you hire a man to run the boat?"

"Yes; I can get a boy who will do it for half a dollar a day, and be
glad of the chance. I will engage one."

"Lawry goes to Burlington to-night to take out a party to-morrow."

"To-night?"

"Yes; he must be there by eight in the morning."

Mrs. Wilford thought her son was having a hard time with the
steamer; but she knew he would be satisfied as long as he was doing
well. Mr. Sherwood, assured that there was nothing at home to detain
the young pilot, left the house. Lawry soon after entered; but he had
not time to tell his mother the particulars of his first trip on the
_Woodville_. He could remain but a few moments, while the hands
were "coaling up," from a cargo of coal deposited on the wharf that
day, by the order of Mr. Sherwood.

At nine o'clock everything was ready for the departure. The fireman
grumbled at being called upon to work at night; but Lawry promised to
get another man to keep watch as soon as he could. It was a long
day's work for all hands. When the young captain had gone to the
wheel-house to start the boat, Mr. Sherwood rushed down the wharf,
and jumped aboard.

"I was afraid I should be too late," said he, as Lawry met him on
the main-deck. "I have been all over the village to find you another
fireman, and I have succeeded in getting you a first-rate one--an old
hand at the business."

"Thank you, sir; you are taking a great deal of trouble for me."

"There's another thing I quite forgot; I didn't pay you for the trip
nor the dinners. Here is the money."

"I can't take it, Mr. Sherwood," protested Captain Lawry.

"But you must take it; if you don't I can't engage the boat again."

"Not from you, sir."

"I am more interested than any other person in your success with the
steamer, and I insist that you take the money."

"I owe you for this cargo of coal, now."

"That was a present from Miss Fanny Grant."

"She is very generous."

"Generous! If she doesn't do more than that for you, I shall be
ashamed of her. By the way, captain, she paid the bill for repairing
the steamer at Port Henry."

"Indeed!" exclaimed Lawry, who had intended to discharge this debt
with the first money he earned. "She is very kind. I don't deserve so
much from her and you."

"More, my boy. We haven't done anything at my house but talk about
you for a week. Now, you must be reasonable. We intended to give you
a good start. Miss Grant wishes to put an upright pianoforte in the
saloon. There is just room for it at the end of the stateroom on the
starboard side. When that is put in, we shall let you alone. Now,
Lawry, take this money; if you don't, I shall be offended."

"I don't like to do so," pleaded Lawry. "It makes me feel mean."

"It need not; take it, Lawry, for you will want money to provision
your boat in the morning."

Captain Lawry took it, though it seemed to burn his fingers.

"Now, my boy, you shall have your own way. I will force nothing more
on you, except what I fairly owe you, and you shall make your fortune
without any help or hindrance from anybody."

"I owe you now---"

"Silence, Lawry!" laughed Mr. Sherwood. "There comes your second
fireman."

As the man came down the gangplank, he handed Mr. Sherwood a long
package, done up in brown paper.

"One thing more, Lawry," said his munificent friend, as he led the
way to the engine-room, which was lighted by a lantern. "Will you let
me put this sign up over the front windows in the wheel-house?"

"Certainly, sir. What is it?"

"It is the motto of the steamer, and fully explains how I lost the
boat," replied Mr. Sherwood, as he unrolled the package.

It was a small sign, about three feet in length, elegantly painted
and gilded, on which was the motto:

HASTE AND WASTE.

"While you were at Port Henry, repairing the boat, I went up to
Burlington, where I ordered this to be done. It came down to-day, and
I want it put up in the wheel-house, where it will be constantly
before your eyes, as the best axiom in the world for a steamboat man.
It will be the history of the _Woodville_ to you, and I hope you
will always act upon it, never running your boat above a safe speed,
nor leave your wharf when it is imprudent to do so."

"I shall be very glad to have those words always before me," replied
Lawry.

"When you are ready to go, captain, we are," said Mr. Sherwood.

"I'm all ready, sir."

Lawry turned, and to his astonishment saw Mrs. Sherwood and Miss
Fanny, who had been looking over his shoulder at the pretty sign.

"We are going with you, Captain Lawry," added Mr. Sherwood; "that
is, if you won't charge us anything for our passage."

"I am very happy to have you as passengers," stammered Lawry.

"We are so much in love with your boat, Lawry, that we could not
stay away from her," added Mrs. Sherwood.

"And her captain," said Miss Fanny.

Lawry was good for nothing at complimentary speeches, and he went
aft to give the girls directions to light up the cabin and the two
staterooms for the accommodation of his unexpected passengers.
