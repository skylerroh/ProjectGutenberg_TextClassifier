vibrate as the clamshells slammed shut. Kumiko and
Scarf moved up to stand behind Brad as pressure
equalizers hissed. Moments later, the air lock's
inner door slid aside and they passed through.
Opening their helmet faceplates, they returned
the glares of the receiving party.

"Rimov, and gunnery is my business," said the
officer, "what in hell are you gonna do to my guns?"

Brad wished he were beside the grizzled spacefarer
facing their common adversary, rather than
confronting him.

"Curtin, and my business is to make sure your
guns don't get you all killed. I want to check your
weapons control center, and every gun emplacement.
First, central control."

"Hey," chimed in Scarf. "How about a drink with the
ship's commander? Courtesies of the space-ways,
and all that? I'd sure like to sample some Inner Region
booze."

"You guys ain't invited guests, no way," Rimov
flashed back. "The Commander is fussy about
the people he drinks with."

"Well, you tell him..." Scarf raised a fist to add
gesture to his words, but Brad waved him off,
his eyes holding on Rimov.

"To hell with that," he snapped. "We're here to
do a job and get back to our ship. I repeat: first,
the fire control center, then each gun emplacement.
Now."

"Our fire control center has been deactivated. Why
do you have to see each gun?"

"You know damn well, Rimov," Brad said, putting as
much harshness into his tone as he could muster.
"Your pieces can be fired independent of central
control; I'm going to make sure they won't be.
Let's get on with it."

Brad noted that Rimov was staring at the intensity
slide visible on the breechblock of his sheathed
weapon. Rimov then tilted his head to scrutinize
the settings on Kumiko and Scarf's weapons. His
brows tightened, puzzled. It passed.

"OK, follow me," he said, pivoting and taking the
lead.

The passageways were narrow, confining them to two
abreast. Rimov and one of his men walked ahead, the
other three escorts followed close behind Brad and
his party. The corridors they traversed had been
cleared; no encounters.

Brad, familiar with transports of the line,
memorized their route. They had boarded
amidships, lower starboard, and were headed for
an armor-enclosed section near the stern. The
surveillance and tracking gear and the laser-quads'
fire control computers should be there. That
part should be relatively simple. They reached
a closed, heavy door. Rimov turned to Brad, his
face reflecting rage.

"You didn't answer my question," he growled.
"What're you gonna do to my guns?"

"Nothing you couldn't fix in a couple of work
shifts," Brad replied, motioning to the door.
"Let's move."

Grudgingly, Rimov placed his palm on the disk
lock. A click and the heavy door retracted into
the adjacent bulkhead.

As Brad expected, the fire control center consisted
of dozens of consoles, scopes, directional and power
control devices, and clusters of computer terminals.

Kumiko and Brad circled the small room as Scarf
watched from his position inside the entryway.
Rimov stood beside Scarf, his guards along the
bulkhead, tense, weapons directed at the deck.

Kumiko pointed to a console.

"I've got to see behind that panel, Brad," she
said, pointing. "The master firing system controls
should be concentrated there."

Brad turned and waved Rimov closer. Scarf didn't
move; he got it all on his helmet intercom.

"Remove the panel," Brad said, pointing.

"Won't take my word, will you," Rimov growled.

Reaching over, he snapped several quick
disconnects, slid the panel forward, reached into
the recess behind, fiddled a couple of seconds,
and pulled the panel forward again. It came loose,
and he stepped back with it in his hands.

"Cut the power to this console," Kumiko ordered.

Rimov shrugged, moved to another console and
snapped several switches. Kumiko watched closely.
Rimov turned back and observed her check several
lights and dials above the space from where the
panel had been removed.

Satisfied, Kumiko drew off her outer glove. Her
hand remained encased in translucent, skin-tight
insulation. Reaching into the cavity, she withdrew
a tiny black chip. Setting it down on a nearby
shelf, she repeated the operation. Shortly,
a dozen chips lay on the shelf.

Rimov flushed with fury as he watched Kumiko
work, but remained silent.

Finally, Kumiko stepped back, pulled a plastic
bag from a pocket in her suit, and dropped in
the assorted parts. Looking around the room,
she went to a wall cabinet, opened the door,
rummaged about and withdrew still more chips.

"Back up supplies," she said, adding them to
the others in the plastic bag.

Kumiko looked at Brad.

"The fire control center is out of action," she
said. "Even if they do have more spares stashed
away, it'll take them at least twenty hours to
install the parts and calibrate the system."

Brad turned to Rimov. "Let's start with the aft gun
turrets, and take them, in order, moving forward."





 Chapter TWENTY


The next two hours were given to rushing along
passageways, climbing companionways and ladders,
and crawling along narrow walkways. Several turrets
could only be reached from the outside; Kumiko's
advice to wear suits proved sound.

At each gun emplacement, Rimov, his guards and
Scarf watched Brad and Kumiko inspect sector
guides, range and directional interlocks and power
drives.

Once satisfied that a gun emplacement was not
booby-trapped, Kumiko inserted random realignment
parameters into laser blocks, twirled tracking
sequencers into disarray, and switched about chips
and connectors. When she was done with a turret,
the gun had a zero firing potential, and would take
hours to repair, calibrate and test.

Brad noted that Rimov, following Kumiko's work
closely, showed grudging admiration in his eyes.
She was disabling the guns with gentle care, not
damaging them, and Rimov knew it.

Finally, they were at the ship's bow. The final
turret had been rendered inoperative.

Brad faced Rimov.

"We'll be on our way. Back to the air lock."

Brad was relieved. They would soon be in the
utility, heading back to the Dragon, the job done.
Even Scarf could not fault them. Scarf's report
might even work to the Sentinel's advantage.

Rimov took the lead. The deckhands seemed less
tense. They sensed that Rimov was impressed
by Kumiko's professionalism, and they, too, had
observed the consideration that Kumiko had shown
for the ship's equipment. She was obviously not
a crowbar techie.

They moved toward the air lock single file, Rimov
in the lead, Brad, Kumiko and Scarf following, and
the four deckhands, two abreast, in the rear.

Rounding a corner, they stopped. Ahead, three
men crouched, laser-rifles at their shoulders
aimed at them.

"Rimov, and you guys in the rear, outta the way.
We're puttin' these bastards down."

The order came from a short, blond-haired buck,
eyes glaring above his gunfight.

"Wait," Rimov screamed. "What's the hell's goin'
on, Cordy? These guys got safe conduct from Bura."

"I don't buy that, Rimov. We got the word down
below that the ship's bein' taken over by Narval's
goons. We're gonna stop 'em. Come for'ard,
I'm tellin' ya. They're goin' down, right now. Get
ready, Joe, Pete."

The two guards behind Scarf and Kumiko dropped
to the deck and snaked back around the corner.
They were not about to shoot at shipmates.

Rimov dashed toward Cordy, his arms waving.

"Don't fire. Back off," he shouted.

The men with the rifles were momentarily confused,
uncertain; one began to lower his weapon. Rimov
was a ship's officer; they would be in deep trouble
if they disobeyed.

Without warning, the decision was taken from them.

Scarf panicked.

Stepping back and behind Kumiko, using her as
his shield, he frantically jerked his heavy hand
weapon loose, at the same time crouching in firing
position. Gripping the weapon with both hands,
he rammed the setting into max and fired around
Kumiko. Brad was out of his momentary line of
fire. Not so Rimov.

The burst hit Rimov between the shoulder blades.
There was a sharp, crackling sound as cloth and
Rimov's flesh carbonized. He fell forward, dead
before he struck the deck.

No one moved. Cordy and his men stared at their
fallen officer.

Brad didn't wait for them to recover.

"Back," he shouted to Kumiko and Scarf. "Around
the bend. Now."

Kumiko whirled and raced around the corner.
Scarf rolled back on to his feet and dashed after
her. Brad followed.

Rimov's guards were nowhere in sight.

There was a roar of rage behind them.

Cordy.

"They shot Rimov. After 'em. Shoot to kill."

The passageway was long; they would be at the
wrong end of a shooting gallery as soon as Cordy
reached the bend. The only break was a narrow
ladder through a hatch in the overhead.

"Up," Brad commanded. "Fast."

Kumiko first, then Scarf. Brad followed.

As Brad drew his legs up through the hatchway
a searing blast struck the frame, missing him
by centimeters. Brad twisted away as another
bolt flashed up through the hatch, scorching
the bulkhead from which he had just moved.

Brad shouted down. "First guy who shoves his head
through the hatch gets it burned off." Turning to
Kumiko and Scarf he whispered, "That won't hold
them for long."

"Listen, about that shooting...", Scarf began.

Brad snapped him short with an impatient gesture.
"Not now. Let's get to the utility."

They looked around. The space was almost dark;
the only light from widely spaced, low-power
neutro-lamps. They were standing on a narrow
platform, little more than a ledge, from which a
catwalk bridged a complex of girders and cables.

Brad mentally reconstructed their route before
Cordy's challenge. The portal through which they
boarded should be within fifty meters of where
they crouched. Their lives depended on the catwalk
passing close to it.

Studying the arrangement of the structures around
them and the coding on cable bundles, Brad peered
along the catwalk, first in one direction, then the
opposite.

He looked at the open hatch and shouted down. "We
demand safe conduct to our ship. Do you hear me?"

Silence.

Scarf shoved his face close to Brad.

"Are you kiddin'?" he said, his tone expressing his
disbelief. "I just killed one of their men. They're
not gonna give us safe conduct anywhere."

"I know that," Brad replied. "Even if they do
promise us safe conduct, it'll be just to get at
us. I want them to think we're going to hole up
here until they give us an answer. Bura must know
by now. We've got to get off before he personally
takes charge of the search."

Brad again scrutinized the ship's stringers and
cable insulation colors. He pointed.

"Stay close."

They crossed stretches where ledges and walkways
narrowed abruptly to barely enough for passage.
Sharp projections along the way snagged and abraded
their protective suits. They realized that they
might face serious seepage from their suits as
soon as they entered the vacuum of space.

A sudden, raking fire erupted behind them. Metal
frames around them darkened from the bolts of
energy.

Scarf jerked his weapon and returned the shots
before Brad could stop him. The flash of his weapon
provided the ideal target, and brought concentrated
fire in return.

Stooping and sliding, Brad and Kumiko stumbled
forward. Scarf scrambled along behind, firing
haphazardly to the rear.

Scarf howled with sudden pain. Brad looked back. In
the dim light, Scarf hung over a girder, motionless.
Brad raced back to his side. A wide strip from
sleeve and shoulder was burned away; blood oozed.

Kumiko bent beside Brad. She yanked her glove
off, reached in through the still smoking sleeve
and felt for a pulse in Scarf's neck.

"Alive."

She stepped back. Brad, in the cramped space,
hauled the unconscious Scarf upright, bent, and
with Kumiko's help, lifted him on to Brad's back.

Scarf's scream of pain had brought a pause to
the firing.

Grasping stanchions and cables for support,
Brad staggered along the catwalk.

"Hatch up ahead."

"Might be it."

Brad gasped. Even in the light pseudo-gravity,
Scarf's bulk was hard to maneuver.

"Take a peek."

Kumiko was gone and back in an instant.

"Looks clear."

"No choice. Down you go. I'll drop him through."

Kumiko dropped out of sight. Brad thrust Scarf
through the hatch and followed. The drop was not
deep.

The number 4 air lock was less than ten meters
ahead. Brad heaved Scarf across his shoulders, and
with Kumiko leading the way, they rushed toward it.

The deck carried the slap of running feet, fast and
closing.

Cordy appeared at the end of the passage. Seeing
them, he crouched on one knee and raised his weapon.

Kumiko beat him; at the sound of running, she had
raised her sidearm. As Cordy took aim, she fired.
Cordy fell back, stunned.

Brad had the door to the outer air lock open, Scarf
on the deck inside. Kumiko rushed past Brad and
he slammed the door and clipped it sealed. She
snatched an emergency space stretcher from
a bulkhead rack and snapped it open. It took the
two of them to roll Scarf's inert body into the
envelope, seal it around him and start an oxygen
flow.

They snapped their faceplates closed. Brad hit
switches. The outer portals slid apart. The catwalk
and other connections to the utility were still in
place. Carrying the stretcher between them, they
crossed over.





 Chapter TWENTY-ONE


Brad poked his head into Drummer's office at Fleet
Headquarters. Drummer, at his desk, bent over
a document, cast frequent glances at electronic
displays on the wall nearby. Racks of data
capsules, no space for them on the busy
desk, crowded the floor nearby. A conical view
tank, recessed in the wall to his left, glowed
with symbols of ships and their military
characteristics, along with tactical and logistical
links.

Scanning the monitors and view tank, Drummer
hefted a hand control and pressed keys. Eyes
half-closed, he silently transformed mental images
into memoranda and messages. Aware of Brad's
presence, he paused and focused on him in the doorway.

"I thought you planned to take a couple of days off
after Tornado Six," Brad said.

"Can't," Drummer replied, his eyes back to his notes.

"What's happening?"

"Until Tornado Six, our forces functioned as
