a fine Morning loaded and Set out at 7 oClock at 21/2 miles passed a
run on the Stard. Side haveing passed 2 Islands and two bad rapids at 3
miles lower passed a Creek on the Lard. with wide Cotton willow bottoms
haveing passed an Island and a rapid an Indian Camp of three Lodgs
below the Creek at 81/2 miles lower we arrived at the heade of a verry
bad riffle at which place we landed near 8 Lodges of Indians on the
Lard Side to view the riffle, haveing passed two Islands & Six rapids
Several of them verry bad-after view'g this riffle two Canoes were
taken over verry well; the third Stuck on a rock which took us an hour
to get her off which was effected without her receving a greater
injurey than a Small Split in her Side which was repared in a Short
time, we purchased fish & dogs of those people, dined and proceeded on-
here we met with an Indian from the falls at which place he Sais he Saw
white people, and expressd an inclination to accompany us, we passd. a
fiew miles above this riffle 2 Lodges and an Indian batheing in a hot
bath made by hot Stones thrown into a pon of water. at this riffle
which we Call ragid rapid took meridian altitude of the Suns upper Limb
with Sextt. 74 deg. 26' 0" Latd. produced ____ North at five miles lower and
Sixty miles below the forks arived at a large Southerly fork which is
the one we were on with the Snake or So-So-nee nation (haveing passed 5
rapids) This South fork or Lewis's River which has two forks which fall
into it on the South the ist Small the upper large and about 2 days
march up imediately parrelal to the first villages we Came to and is
called by those Indians Par-nash-te on this fork a little above its
mouth resides a Chief who as the Indian Say has more horses than he can
Count and further Sayeth that Louises River is navagable about 60 miles
up with maney rapids at which places the Indians have fishing Camps and
Lodjes built of an oblong form with flat ruffs. below the 1st river on
the South Side there is ten established fishing places on the 1st fork
which fall in on the South Side is one fishing place, between that and
the Par nash to River, five fishing places, above two, and one on that
river all of the Cho-pun-nish or Pierced Nose Nation many other Indians
reside high up those rivers The Countrey about the forks is an open
Plain on either Side I can observe at a distance on the lower Stard.
Side a high ridge of Thinly timbered Countrey the water of the South
fork-is a greenish blue, the north as clear as cristial

Imediately in the point is an Indian Cabin & in the South fork a Small
Island, we came to on the Stard. Side below with a view to make some
luner observations the night proved Cloudy and we were disapointed The
Indians Came down all the Couses of this river on each Side on horses
to view us as we were desending,--The man whome we saw at the ruged
rapid and expressed an inclination to accompany us to the great rapids,
came up with his Son in a Small Canoe and procisted in his intentions-
worthey of remark that not one Stick of timber on the river near the
forks and but a fiew trees for a great distance up the River we
decended I think Lewis's River is about 250 yards wide, the Koos koos
ke River about 150 yards wide and the river below the forks about 300
yards wide. a miss understanding took place between Shabono one of our
interpreters, and Jo. & R Fields which appears to have originated in
just--our diet extremely bad haveing nothing but roots and dried fish
to eate, all the Party have greatly the advantage of me, in as much as
they all relish the flesh of the dogs, Several of which we purchased of
the nativs for to add to our Store of fish and roots &c. &c.-

The Cho-pun-nish or Pierced nose Indians are Stout likeley men, handsom
women, and verry dressey in their way, the dress of the men are a white
Buffalow robe or Elk Skin dressed with Beeds which are generally white,
Sea Shells-i e the Mother of Pirl hung to ther hair & on a pice of
otter Skin about their necks hair Cewed in two parsels hanging forward
over their Sholders, feathers, and different Coloured Paints which they
find in their Countrey Generally white, Green & light Blue. Some fiew
were a Shirt of Dressed Skins and long legins, & Mockersons Painted,
which appears to be their winters dress, with a plat of twisted grass
about their necks.

The women dress in a Shirt of Ibex, or Goat Skins which reach quite
down to their anckles with a girdle, their heads are not ornemented,
their Shirts are ornemented with quilled Brass, Small peces of Brass
Cut into different forms, Beeds, Shells & curios bones &c. The men
expose those parts which are generally kept from view by other nations
but the women are more perticular than any other nation which I have
passed in Screting the parts

Their amusements appear but fiew as their Situation requires the utmost
exertion to prcure food they are generally employed in that pursute,
all the Summer & fall fishing for the Salmon, the winter hunting the
deer on Snow Shoes in the plains and takeing care of ther emence
numbers of horses, & in the Spring cross the mountains to the Missouri
to get Buffalow robes and meet &c. at which time they frequent meet
with their enemies & lose their horses & maney of ther people

Ther disorders are but fiew and those fiew of a Scofelous nature. they
make great use of Swetting. The hot and cold baethes, They are verry
Selfish and Stingey of what they have to eate or ware, and they expect
in return Something for everything give as presents or the Survices
which they doe let it be however Small, and fail to make those returns
on their part.

an Canoe to Shore with the Loss of Some bedding Tomahaws Shot pouches
Skins Clothes &c &c. all wet we had every articles exposed to the Sun
to dry on the Island, our loss in provisions is verry Considerable all
our roots was in the Canoe that Sunk, and Cannot be dried Sufficint to
Save, our loose powder was also in the Canoe and is all wett This I
think, we Shall saved.--In this Island we found some Split timber the
parts of a house which the Indians had verry Securely covered with
Stone, we also observed a place where the Indians had buried there
fish, we have made it a point at all times not to take any thing
belonging to the Indians even their wood. but at this time we are
Compelled to violate that rule and take a part of the Split timber we
find here bured for fire wood, as no other is to be found in any
direction. our Small Canoe which was a head returned at night with 2
ores which they found floating below. The wind this after noon from the
S. W. as usial and hard way of the forks to the Indian Camps at the
first were not one mouthfull to eate untill night as our hunters could
kill nothing and I could See & catch no fish except a few Small ones.
The Indians gave us 2 Sammon boiled which I gave to the men, one of my
men Shot a Sammon in the river about Sunset those fish gave us a
Supper. all the Camp flocked about me untill I went to Sleep--and I
beleve if they had a Sufficency to eate themselves and any to Spare
they would be liberal of it I detected the men to mend their Mockessons
to night and turn out in the morning early to hunt Deer fish birds &c.
&c. Saw great numbers of the large Black grass hopper. Some bars which
were verry wild, but few Birds. a number of ground Lizards; Some fiew
Pigions plainly See a rainge of mountains which bore S. E. & N. W. the
nearest point south about 60 miles, and becoms high toward the N. W.
The plaines on each Side is wavering. Labiesh killed 2 gees & 2 Ducks
of the large kind. at two oClock we loaded & Set out, our Powder &
Provisions of roots not Sufficently dry. we Shall put them out at the
forks or mouth of this river which is at no great distance, and at
which place we Shall delay to make Some Selestial observations &c.
passed Eleven Island and Seven rapids to day. Several of the rapids
verry bad and dificuelt to pass. The Islands of different Sizes and all
of round Stone and Sand, no timber of any kind in Sight of the river, a
fiew Small willows excepted; in the evening the countrey becomes lower
not exceding 90 or 100 feet above the water and back is a wavering
Plain on each Side, passed thro narrows for 3 miles where the Clifts of
rocks juted to the river on each Side compressing the water of the
river through a narrow chanel; below which it widens into a kind of
bason nearly round without any proceptiable current, at the lower part
of this bason is a bad dificuelt and dangerous rapid to pass, at the
upper part of this rapid we over took the three Indians who had Polited
us thro the rapids from the forks. those people with our 2 Chiefs had
proceeded on to this place where they thought proper to delay for us to
warn us of the difficulties of this rapid. we landed at a parcel of
Split timber, the timber of a house of Indians out hunting the Antilope
in the plains; and raised on Scaffolds to Save them from the Spring
floods. here we were obliged for the first time to take the property of
the Indians without the consent or approbation of the owner. the night
was cold & we made use of a part of those boards and Split logs for
fire wood. Killed two teel this evening. Examined the rapids which we
found more dificuelt to pass than we expected from the Indians
information. a Suckcession of Sholes, appears to reach from bank to
bank for 3 miles which was also intersepted with large rocks Sticking
up in every direction, and the chanel through which we must pass
crooked and narrow. we only made 20 miles today, owing to the detention
in passing rapids &c.

Oar. 16th 1805 Wednesday
a cool morning Set out early passed the rapid with all the Canoes
except Sgt. Pryors which run on a rock near the lower part of the rapid
and Stuck fast, by the assistance of the 3 other Canoes She was
unloaded and got off the rock without any further injorey than, the
wetting the greater part of her loading--loaded and proceeded on I
walked around this rapid

We halted a Short time above the Point and Smoked with the Indians, &
examined the Point and best place for our Camp, we Camped on the
Columbia River a little above the point I Saw about 200 men Comeing
down from their villages & were turned back by the Chief, after we
built our fires of what wood we Could Collect, & get from the Indians,
the Chief brought down all his men Singing and dancing as they Came,
formed a ring and danced for Some time around us we gave them a Smoke,
and they returned the village a little above, the Chief & Several delay
untill I went to bead. bought 7 dogs & they gave us Several fresh
Salmon & Som horse dried




[Clark, October 16, 1805]
October 16th Wednesday 1805
A cool morning deturmined to run the rapids, put our Indian guide in
front our Small Canoe next and the other four following each other, the
canoes all passed over Safe except the rear Canoe which run fast on a
rock at the lower part of the Rapids, with the early assistance of the
other Canoes & the Indians, who was extreamly ellert every thing was
taken out and the Canoe got off without any enjorie further than the
articles which it was loaded all wet. at 14 miles passed a bad rapid at
which place we unloaded and made a portage of 3/4 of a mile, haveing
passd. 4 Smaller rapids, three Islands and the parts of a house above,
I Saw Indians & Horses on the South Side below. five Indians came up
the river in great haste, we Smoked with them and gave them a piece of
tobacco to Smoke with their people and Sent them back, they Set out in
a run & continued to go as fast as They Could run as far as we Could
See them. after getting Safely over the rapid and haveing taken Diner
Set out and proceeded on Seven miles to the junction of this river and
the Columbia which joins from the N. W. passd. a rapid two Islands and
a graveley bare, and imediately in the mouth a rapid above an Island.
In every direction from the junction of those rivers the Countrey is
one Continued plain low and rises from the water gradually, except a
range of high Countrey which runs from S. W & N E and is on the opposit
Side about 2 miles distant from the Collumbia and keeping its detection
S W untill it joins a S W. range of mountains.

We halted above the point on the river Kimooenim to Smoke with the
Indians who had collected there in great numbers to view us, here we
met our 2 Chiefs who left us two days ago and proceeded on to this
place to inform those bands of our approach and friendly intentions
towards all nations &c. we also met the 2 men who had passed us Several
days ago on hors back, one of them we observed was a man of great
influence with those Indians, harranged them; after Smokeing with the
Indians who had collected to view us we formed a camp at the point near
which place I Saw a fiew pieces of Drift wood after we had our camp
fixed and fires made, a Chief came from their Camp which was about 1/4
of a mile up the Columbia river at the head of about 200 men Singing
and beeting on their drums Stick and keeping time to the musik, they
formed a half circle around us and Sung for Some time, we gave them all
Smoke, and Spoke to their Chiefs as well as we could by Signs informing
them of our friendly disposition to all nations, and our joy in Seeing
those of our Children around us, Gave the principal chief a large Medal
Shirt and Handkf. a 2nd Chief a Meadel of Small Size, and to the Cheif
who came down from the upper villages a Small Medal & Handkerchief.

The Chiefs then returned with the men to their camp; Soon after we
purchased for our Provisions Seven Dogs, Some fiew of those people made
us presents of fish and Several returned and delayed with us untill
bedtime--The 2 old Chiefs who accompanied us from the head of the river
precured us Some full Such as the Stalks of weed or plant and willow
bushes--one man made me a present of a about 20 lb. of verry fat Dried
horse meat.

Great quantities of a kind of prickley pares, much worst than any I
have before Seen of a tapering form and attach themselves by bunches.




[Clark, October 17, 1805]
October 17th Thursday 1805 Forks of Columbia
This morning after the Luner observations, the old chief came down, and
Several men with dogs to Sell & womin with fish &c. the Dogs we
purchased the fish not good.

I took 2 men and Set out in a Small Canoe with a view to go as high up
the Columbia river as the 1st forks which the Indians made Signs was
but a Short distance, I set out at 2 oClock firs course was N. 83 deg. W 6
miles to the lower point of a Island on the Lard. Side, passed an
Island in the middle of the river at 5 miles, at the head of which is a
rapid not bad at this rapid 3 Lodges of mats on the Lard emenc
quantites of dried fish, then West 4 miles to the Lower point of an
Island on the Stard. Side, 2 lodges of Indians large and built of mats-
passed 3 verry large mat lodges at 2 mile on the Stard Side large
Scaffols of fish drying at every lodge, and piles of Salmon lying. the
Squars engaged prepareing them for the Scaffol--a Squar gave me a dried
Salmon from those lodes on the Island an Indian Showed me the mouth of
the river which falls in below a high hill on the Lard. N. 80 deg. W. 8 miles
from the Island. The river bending Lard.--This river is remarkably
Clear and Crouded with Salmon in maney places, I observe in assending
great numbers of Salmon dead on the Shores, floating on the water and
in the Bottoms which can be seen at the debth of 20 feet. the Cause of
the emence numbers of dead Salmon I can't account for So it is I must
have seen 3 or 400 dead and maney living the Indians, I believe make
use of the fish which is not long dead as, I Struck one nearly dead and
left him floating, Some Indians in a canoe behind took the fish on
board his canoe

The bottoms on the South Side as high as the Tarcouche tesse is from 1
to 2 miles wide, back of the bottoms rises to hilly countrey, the Plain
is low on the North & Easte for a great distance no wood to be Seen in
any direction.

The Tarcouche tesse bears South of West, the Columbia N W above range
of hills on the West Parrelel a range of mountains to the East which
appears to run nearly North & South distance not more than 50 miles--I
returned to the point at Dusk followed by three canoes of Indians 20 in
number--I killed a Fowl of the Pheasent kind as large as a turkey. The
length from his Beeck to the end of its tail 2 feet 6--3/4 Inches, from
the extremity of its wings across 3 feet 6 Inches. the tail feathers 13
Inches long, feeds on grass hoppers, and the Seed of wild Isoop 6

Those Indians are orderly, badly dressed in the Same fashions of those
above except the women who wore Short Shirts and a flap over them 22
Fishing houses of Mats robes of Deer, Goat & Beaver.




[Clark, October 17, 1805]
October 17th Thursday 1805
A fair morning made the above observations during which time the
principal Chief came down with Several of his principal men and Smoked
with us. Several men and woman offered Dogs and fish to Sell, we
purchased all the dogs we could, the fish being out of Season and
dieing in great numbers in the river, we did not think proper to use
them, Send out Hunters to Shute the Prarie Cock a large fowl which I
have only Seen on this river; Several of which I have killed, they are
the Size of a Small turkey, of the pheasant kind, one I killed on the
water edge to day measured from the Beek to the end of the toe 2 feet 6
& 3/4 Inches; from the extremities of its wings 3 feet 6 inches; the
tale feathers is 13 inches long; they feed on grasshoppers and the Seed
of the wild plant which is also peculiar to this river and the upper
parts of the Missoury somewhat resembling the whins-. Capt. Lewis took
a vocabelary of the Language of those people who call themselves So
hulk, and also one of the language of a nation resideing on a Westerly
fork of the Columbia which mouthes a fiew miles above this place who
Call themselves Chim na pum Some fiew of this nation reside with the So
kulks nation, Their language differ but little from either the Sokulks
or the Cho-pun-nish (or pierced nose) nation which inhabit the
Koskoskia river and Lewis's R below.

I took two men in a Small Canoe and assended the Columbia river 10
miles to an Island near the Stard. Shore on which two large Mat Lodges
of Indians were drying Salmon, (as they informed me by Signs for the
purpose of food and fuel, & I do not think at all improbable that those
people make use of Dried fish as fuel,) The number of dead Salmon on
the Shores & floating in the river is incrediable to Say and at this
Season they have only to collect the fish Split them open and dry them
on their Scaffolds on which they have great numbers, how far they have
to raft their timber they make their Scaffolds of I could not lern; but
there is no timber of any Sort except Small willow bushes in Sight in
any directionfrom this Island the natives showed me the enterance of a
large Westerly fork which they Call Tapetett at about 8 miles distant,
the evening being late I deturmined to return to the forks, at which
place I reached at Dark. from the point up the Columbia River is N. 83 deg.
W. 6 miles to the lower point of an Island near the Lard. Side passed a
Island in the middle of the river at 5 miles at the head of which is a
rapid, not dangerous on the Lard Side opposit to this rapid is a
fishing place 3 Mat Lodges, and great quants. of Salmon on Scaffolds
drying. Saw great numhers of Dead Salmon on the Shores and floating in
the water, great numbers of Indians on the banks viewing me and 18
canoes accompanied me from the point--The Waters of this river is
Clear, and a Salmon may be Seen at the deabth of 15 or 20 feet. West 4
miles to the lower point of a large Island near the Stard. Side at 2
Lodges, passed three large lodges on the Stard Side near which great
number of Salmon was drying on Scaffolds one of those Mat lodges I
entered found it crouded with men women and children and near the
enterance of those houses I saw maney Squars engaged Splitting and
drying Salmon. I was furnished with a mat to Sit on, and one man Set
about prepareing me Something to eate, first he brought in a piece of a
Drift log of pine and with a wedge of the elks horn, and a malet of
Stone curioesly Carved he Split the log into Small pieces and lay'd it
open on the fire on which he put round Stones, a woman handed him a
basket of water and a large Salmon about half Dried, when the Stones
were hot he put them into the basket of water with the fish which was
Soon Suflicently boiled for use. it was then taken out put on a platter
of rushes neetly made, and Set before me they boiled a Salmon for each
of the men with me, dureing those preperations, I Smoked with those
about me who Chose to Smoke which was but fiew, this being a custom
those people are but little accustomed to and only Smok thro form.
after eateing the boiled fish which was delicious, I Set out & halted
or came too on the Island at the two Lodges. Several fish was given to
me, in return for Which I gave Small pieces of ribbond from those
Lodges the natives Showed me the mouth of Tap teel River about 8 miles
above on the west Side this western fork appears to beare nearly West,
The main Columbia river N W.--a range of high land to the S W and
parralal to the river and at the distance of 2 miles on the Lard. Side,
the countrey low on the Stard. Side, and all Coverd. with a weed or
plant about 2 & three feet high and resembles the whins. I can proceive
a range of mountains to the East which appears to bare N. & South
distant about 50 or 60 miles. no wood to be Seen in any derection--On
my return I was followd. by 3 canoes in which there was 20 Indians I
shot a large Prairie Cock Several Grouse, Ducks and fish. on my return
found Great Numbr. of the nativs with Capt Lewis, men all employd in
dressing ther Skins mending their clothes and putting ther arms in the
best order the latter being always a matter of attention with us. The
Dress of those natives differ but little from those on the Koskoskia
and Lewis's rivers, except the women who dress verry different in as
much as those above ware long leather Shirts which highly ornimented
with heeds Shells &c. &c. and those on the main Columbia river only
ware a truss or pece of leather tied around them at their hips and
drawn tite between ther legs and fastened before So as barly to hide
those parts which are So Sacredly hid & Scured by our women. Those
women are more inclined to Copulency than any we have yet Seen, with
low Stature broad faces, heads flatened and the foward compressed so as
to form a Streight line from the nose to the Crown of the head, their
eyes are of a Duskey black, their hair of a corse black without
orniments of any kind braded as above, The orniments of each Sects are
Similar, Such as large blue & white beeds, either pendant from their
ears or encircling their necks, or wrists & arms. they also ware
bracelets of Brass, Copper & horn, and trinkets of Shells, fish bones
and curious feathers. Their garments Consists of a short Shirt of
leather and a roabe of the Skins of Deer or the Antilope but fiew of
them ware Shirts all have Short robes. Those people appears to live in
a State of comparitive happiness; they take a greater Share labor of
the woman, than is common among Savage tribes, and as I am informd.
Content with one wife (as also those on the Ki moo e nim river) Those
people respect the aged with veneration, I observed an old woman in one
of the Lodges which I entered She was entirely blind as I was informed
by Signs, had lived more than 100 winters, She occupied the best
position in the house, and when She Spoke great attention was paid to
what She Said-. Those people as also those of the flat heads which we
had passed on the Koskoske and Lewis's rivers are Subject to Sore eyes,
and maney are blind of one and Some of both eyes. this misfortune must
be owing to the reflections of the Sun &c. on the waters in which they
are continually fishing during the Spring Summer & fall, & the Snows
dureing the, winter Seasons, in this open countrey where the eye has no
rest. I have observed amongst those, as well in all other tribes which
I have passed on these waters who live on fish maney of different
Sectes who have lost their teeth about middle age, Some have their
teeth worn to the gums, perticelar those of the upper jaws, and the
tribes generally have bad teeth the cause of it I cannot account sand
attachd. to the roots &c the method they have of useing the dri'd
Salmon, which is mearly worming it and eating the rine & Scales with
the flesh of the fish, no doubt contributes to it

The Houses or Lodges of the tribes of the main Columbia river is of
large mats made of rushes, Those houses are from 15 to 60 feet in
length generally of an Oblong Squar form, Suported by poles on forks in
the iner Side, Six feet high, the top is covered also with mats
leaveing a Seperation in the whole length of about 12 or 15 inches
wide, left for the purpose of admitting light and for the Smok of the
fire to pass which is made in the middle of the house.--The roughfs are
nearly flat, which proves to me that rains are not common in this open
Countrey

Those people appeare of a mild disposition and friendly disposedThey
have in their huts independant of their nets gigs & fishing tackling
each bows & large quivers of arrows on which they use flint Spikes.
Theire ammusements are Similar to those of the Missouri. they are not
beggerley and receive what is given them with much joy.

I saw but flew horses they appeared make but little use of those
animals principally useing Canoes for their uses of procureing food &c.

little value, Such as beeds, bell, & thimbles, of which they appeard
verry fond, at 4 OClock we Set out down the Great Columbia accompand by
our two old Chiefs, one young man wished to accompany us, but we had no
room for more, & he could be of no Service to us

October 18th Friday 1805
This morning Cool and fare wind from the S. E. Six of the large Prarie
cock killed this morning. Several canoes of Indians Came down and
joined those with us, we had a council with those in which we informed
of our friendly intentions towards them and all other of our red
children; of our wish to make a piece between all of our red Children
in this quarter &c. &c. this was conveyed by Signs thro our 2 Chiefs
who accompanied us, and was understood, we made a 2d Chief and gave
Strings of wompom to them all in remembrance of what we Said--four men
in a Canoe came up from a large encampment on an Island in the River
about 8 miles below, they delayed but a fiew minits and returned,
without Speaking a word to us.

The Great Chief and one of the Chim-na pum nation drew me a Sketch of
the Columbia above and the tribes of his nation, living on the bank,
and its waters, and the Tape tett river which falls in 18 miles above
on the westerly side See Sketch below for the number of villages and
nations &c. &c.

We thought it necessary to lay in a Store of Provisions for our voyage,
and the fish being out of Season, we purchased forty dogs for which we
gave articles of little value, Such as bells, thimbles, knitting pins,
brass wire & a few beeds all of which they appeared well Satisfied and
pleased.

every thing being arranged we took in our Two Chiefs, and Set out on
the great Columbia river, haveing left our guide and the two young men
two of them enclined not to proceed on any further, and the 3rd could
be of no Service to us as he did not know the river below

Took our leave of the Chiefs and all those about us and proceeded on
down the great Columbia river passed a large Island at 8 miles about 3
miles in length, a Island on the Stard. Side the upper point of which
is opposit the center of the last mentioned Island and reaches 31/2
miles below the 1st. Island and opposit to this near the middle of the
river nine Lodges are Situated on the upper point at a rapid which is
between the lower point of the 1st Island and upper point of this;
great numbers of Indians appeared to be on this Island, and emence
quantites of fish Scaffold we landed a few minits to view a rapid which
Commenced at the lower point, passd this rapid which was verry bad
between 2 Small Islands two Still Smaller near the Lard. Side, at this
rapid on the Stard. Side is 2 Lodges of Indians Drying fish, at 21/2
miles lower and 141/2 below the point passed an Island Close under the
Stard. Side on which was 2 Lodges of Indians drying fish on Scaffolds
as above at 16 miles from the point the river passesinto the range of
high Countrey at which place the rocks project into the river from the
high clifts which is on the Lard. Side about 2/3 of the way across and
those of the Stard Side about the Same distance, the Countrey rises
here about 200 feet above The water and is bordered with black rugid
rocks, at the Commencement of this high Countrey on Lard Side a Small
riverlet falls in which appears to passed under the high County in its
whole cose Saw a mountain bearing S. W. Conocal form Covered with Snow.
passed 4 Islands, at the upper point of the 3rd is a rapid, on this
Island is two Lodges of Indians, drying fish, on the fourth Island
Close under the Stard. Side is nine large Lodges of Indians Drying fish
on Scaffolds as above at this place we were called to land, as it was
near night and no appearance of wood, we proceeded on about 2 miles
lower to Some willows, at which place we observed a drift log formed a
Camp on the Lard Side under a high hill nearly opposit to five Lodges
of Indians; Soon after we landed, our old Chiefs informed us that the
large camp above "was the Camp of the 1st Chief of all the tribes in
this quarter, and that he had called to us to land and Stay all night
with him, that he had plenty of wood for us &" This would have been
agreeable to us if it had have been understood perticelarly as we were
compelled to Use drid willows for fuel for the purpose of cooking, we
requested the old Chiefs to walk up on the Side we had landed and call
to the Chief to come down and Stay with us all night which they did;
late at night the Chief came down accompanied by 20 men, and formed a
Camp a Short distance above, the chief brought with him a large basket
of mashed berries which he left at our Lodge as a present. I saw on the
main land opposit those Lodges a number of horses feeding, we made 21
miles to day.

The great chief Yel-lep-pit two other chiefs, and a Chief of Band below
presented themselves to us verry early this morning. we Smoked with
them, enformed them as we had all others above as well as we Could by
Signs of our friendly intentions towards our red children Perticular
those who opened their ears to our Councils. we gave a Medal, a
Handkercheif & a String of Wompom to Yelleppit and a String of wompom
to each of the others. Yelleppit is a bold handsom Indian, with a
dignified countenance about 35 years of age, about 5 feet 8 inches high
and well perpotiond. he requested us to delay untill the Middle of the
day, that his people might Come down and See us, we excused our Selves
and promised to Stay with him one or 2 days on our return which
appeared to Satisfy him; great numbers of Indians Came down in Canoes
to view us before we Set out which was not untill 9 oClock A M. we
proceeded on passed a Island, close under the Lard Side about Six miles
in length opposit to the lower point of which two Isds. are situated on
one of which five Lodges vacent & Saffolds drying fish at the upper
point of this Island Swift water. a Short distance below passed two
Islands; one near the middle of the river on which is Seven lodges of
Indians drying fish, at our approach they hid themselves in their
Lodges and not one was to be seen untill we passed, they then Came out
in greater numbers than is common in Lodges of their Size, it is
probable that, the inhabitants of the 5 Lodges above had in a fright
left their lodges and decended to this place to defend them Selves if
attackted there being a bad rapid opposit the Island thro which we had
to pass prevented our landing on this Island and passifying those
people, about four miles below this fritened Island we arrived at the
head of a verry bad rapid, we came too on the Lard Side to view the
rapid before we would venter to run it, as the Chanel appeared to be
close under the oppd. Shore, and it would be necessary to liten our
canoe, I deturmined to walk down on the Lard Side, with the 2 Chiefs
the interpreter & his woman, and derected the Small canoe to prcede
down on the Lard Side to the foot of the rapid which was about 2 miles
in length I Sent on the Indian Chiefs &c. down and I assended a high
clift about 200 feet above the water from the top of which is a leavel
plain extending up the river and off for a great extent, at this place
the Countrey becoms low on each Side of the river, and affords a
prospect of the river and countrey below for great extent both to the
right and left; from this place I descovered a high mountain of emence
hight covered with Snow, this must be one of the mountains laid down by
Vancouver, as Seen from the mouth of the Columbia River, from the
Course which it bears which is West I take it to be Mt. St. Helens,
destant 156 miles a range of mountains in the Derection crossing, a
conacal mountain S. W. toped with Snow This rapid I observed as I
passed opposit to it to be verry bad interseped with high rock and
Small rockey Islands, here I observed banks of Muscle Shells banked up
in the river in Several places, I Delayed at the foot of the rapid
about 2 hours for the Canoes which I Could See met with much dificuelty
in passing down the rapid on the oposit Side maney places the men were
obliged to get into the water and haul the canoes over Sholes--while
Setting on a rock wateing for Capt Lewis I Shot a Crain which was
flying over of the common kind. I observed a great number of Lodges on
the opposit Side at Some distance below and Several Indians on the
opposit bank passing up to where Capt. Lewis was with the Canoes,
others I Saw on a knob nearly opposit to me at which place they delayed
but a Short time before they returned to their Lodges as fast as they
could run, I was fearfull that those people might not be informed of
us, I deturmined to take the little Canoe which was with me and proceed
with the three men in it to the Lodges, on my aproach not one person
was to be Seen except three men off in the plains, and they Sheared off
as I aproached near the Shore, I landed in front of five Lodges which
was at no great distance from each other, Saw no person the enteranc or
Dores of the Lodges wer Shut with the Same materials of which they were
built a mat, I approached one with a pipe in my hand entered a lodge
which was the nearest to me found 32 persons men, women and a few
children Setting permiscuesly in the Lodg, in the greatest agutation,
Some crying and ringing there hands, others hanging their heads. I gave
my hand to them all and made Signs of my friendly dispotion and offered
the men my pipe to Smok and distributed a fiew Small articles which I
had in my pockets,-this measure passified those distressed people verry
much, I then Sent one man into each lodge and entered a Second myself
the inhabitants of which I found more fritened than those of the first
lodge I destributed Sundrey Small articles amongst them, and Smoked
with the men, I then entered the third 4h & fifth Lodge which I found
Somewhat passified, the three men, Drewer Jo. & R. Fields, haveing
useed everey means in their power to convince them of our friendly
disposition to them, I then Set my Self on a rock and made Signs to the
men to come and Smoke with me not one Come out untill the Canoes
arrived with the 2 Chiefs, one of whom spoke aloud, and as was their
Custom to all we had passed the Indians came out & Set by me and Smoked
They said we came from the clouds &c &c and were not men &c. &c. this
time Capt. Lewis came down with the Canoes rear in which the Indian, as
Soon as they Saw the Squar wife of the interperters they pointed to her
and informed those who continued yet in the Same position I first found
them, they imediately all came out and appeared to assume new life, the
sight of This Indian woman, wife to one of our interprs. confirmed
those people of our friendly intentions, as no woman ever accompanies a
war party of Indians in this quarter--Capt Lewis joined us and we
Smoked with those people in the greatest friendship, dureing which time
one of our Old Chiefs informed them who we were from whence we Came and
where we were going giveing them a friendly account of us, those people
do not Speak prosisely the Same language of those above but understand
them, I Saw Several Horses and persons on hors back in the plains maney
of the men womin and children Came up from the Lodges below; all of
them appeared pleased to See us, we traded some fiew articles for fish
and berries, Dined, and proceeded on passed a Small rapid and 15 Lodges
below the five, and Encamped below an Island Close under the Lard Side,
nearly opposit to 24 Lodges on an Island near the middle of the river,
and the Main Stard Shor Soon after we landed which was at a fiew willow
trees about 100 Indians Came from the different Lodges, and a number of
them brought wood which they gave us, we Smoked with all of them, and
two of our Party Peter Crusat & Gibson played on the violin which
delighted them greatly, we gave to the principal man a String of wompon
treated them kindly for which they appeared greatfull, This Tribe can
raise about 350 men their Dress are Similar to those at the fork except
their robes are Smaller and do not reach lower than the waste and 3/4
of them have Scercely any robes at all, the women have only a Small
pece of a robe which Covers their Sholders neck and reaching down
behind to their wastes, with a tite piece of leather about the waste,
the brests are large and hang down verry low illy Shaped, high Cheeks
flattened heads, & have but fiew orniments, they are all employed in
fishing and drying fish of which they have great quantites on their
Scaffolds, their habits customs &c. I could not lern. I killed a Duck
that with the Crain afforded us a good Supper. the Indians continued
all night at our fires

This day we made 36 miles.




[Clark, October 20, 1805]
October 20th 1805 Sunday
a very cold morning wind S. W. about 100 Indians Came over this morning
to See us, after a Smoke, a brackfast on Dogs flesh we Set out. about
350 men

Killed 2 large speckle guts 4 Duck in Malade Small ducks the flavour of
which much resembles the Canvis back no timber of any kind on the

Some have scarlet & blue cloth robes. one has a Salors jacket, The
women have a Short indiferent Shirt, a Short robe of Deer or Goat

[Clark, October 20, 1805]
October 20th Sunday 1805
A cool morning wind S. W. we concluded to delay untill after brackfast
which we were obliged to make on the flesh of dog. after brackfast we
gave all the Indian men Smoke, and we Set out leaveing about 200 of the
nativs at our Encampment; passd. three Indian Lodges on the Lard Side a
little below our Camp which lodges I did not discover last evening,
passed a rapid at Seven miles one at a Short distance below we passed a
verry bad rapid, a chane of rocks makeing from the Stard. Side and
nearly Chokeing the river up entirely with hugh black rocks, an Island
below close under the Stard. Side on which was four Lodges of Indians
drying-fish,--here I Saw a great number of pelicons on the wing, and
black Comerants. at one oClock we landed on the lower point of an
Island at Some Indian Lodges, a large Island on the Stard Side nearly
opposit and a Small one a little below on the Lard Side on those three
Island I counted Seventeen Indian Lodges, those people are in every
respect like those above, prepareing fish for theire winter consumption
here we purchased a fiew indifferent Dried fish & a fiew berries on
which we dined-(On the upper part of this Island we discovered an
Indian vault) our curiosity induced us to examine the methot those
nativs practicd in diposeing the dead, the Vaut was made by broad poads
and pieces of Canoes leaning on a ridge pole which was Suported by 2
forks Set in the ground Six feet in hight in an easterly and westerly
direction and about 60 feet in length, and 12 feet wide, in it I
observed great numbers of humane bones of every description
perticularly in a pile near the Center of the vault, on the East End 21
Scul bomes forming a circle on Mats-; in the Westerley part of the
Vault appeared to be appropriated for those of more resent death, as
many of the bodies of the deceased raped up in leather robes lay on
board covered with mats, &c we observed, independant of the canoes
which Served as a Covering, fishing nets of various kinds, Baskets of
different Sizes, wooden boles, robes Skins, trenchers, and various Kind
of trinkets, in and Suspended on the ends of the pieces forming the
vault; we also Saw the Skeletons of Several Horses at the vault & great
number of bones about it, which Convinced me that those animals were
Sacrefised as well as the above articles to the Deceased.) after diner
we proceeded on to a bad rapid at the lower point of a Small Island on
which four Lodges of Indians were Situated drying fish; here the high
countrey Commences again on the Stard. Side leaveing a vallie of 40
miles in width, from the mustle Shel rapid. examined and passed this
rapid close to the Island at 8 miles lower passed a large Island near
the middle of the river a brook on the Stard. Side and 11 Islds. all in
view of each other below, a riverlit falls in on the Lard. Side behind
a Small Island a Small rapid below. The Star Side is high rugid hills,
the Lard. Side a low plain and not a tree to be Seen in any Direction
except a fiew Small willow bushes which are Scattered partially on the
Sides of the bank

The river to day is about 1/4 of a mile in width; this evening the
Countrey on the Lard. Side rises to the hight of that on the Starboard
Side, and is wavering--we made 42 miles to day; the current much more
uniform than yesterday or the day before. Killed 2 Speckle guls Severl.
ducks of a delicious flavour.

October 21st 1805 Monday
a verry Cold morning we Set out early wind from the S W. we Could not
Cook brakfast before we embarked as usial for the want of wood or
Something to burn.-




[Clark, October 21, 1805]
October 21st Monday 1805
A verry cool morning wind from the S. W. we Set out verry early and
proceeded on, last night we could not Collect more dry willows the only
fuel, than was barely Suffient to cook Supper, and not a Sufficency to
cook brackfast this morning, passd. a Small Island at 51/2 miles a
large one 8 miles in the middle of the river, Some rapid water at the
head and Eight Lodges of nativs opposit its Lower point on the Stard.
Side, we came too at those lodges, bought some wood and brackfast.
Those people recived us with great kindness, and examined us with much
attention, their employments custom Dress and appearance Similar to
those above; Speak the Same language, here we Saw two Scarlet and a
blue cloth blanket, also a Salors Jacket the Dress of the men of this
tribe only a Short robe of Deer or Goat Skins, and that of the womn is
a Short piece of Dressed Skin which fall from the neck So as to Cover
the front of the body as low as the waste, a Short robe, which is of
one Deer or antilope Skin, and a Hap, around their waste and Drawn tite
between their legs as before described, their orniments are but fiew,
and worn as those above.

we got from those people a fiew pounded rotes fish and Acorns of the
white oake, those Acorns they make use of as food, and inform us they
precure them of the nativs who live near the falls below which place
they all discribe by the term Timm at 2 miles lower passed a rapid,
large rocks Stringing into the river of large Size opposit to this
rapid on the Stard. Shore is Situated two Lodges of the nativs drying
fish here we halted a fiew minits to examine the rapid before we
entered it which was our constant Custom, and at all that was verry
dangerous put out all who could not Swim to walk around, after passing
this rapid we proceeded on passed anoothe rapid at 5 miles lower down,
above this rapid on five Lodges of Indians fishing &c. above this rapid
maney large rocks on each Side at Some distance from Shore, one mile
passed an Island Close to the Stard. Side, below which is two Lodge of
nativs, a little below is a bad rapid which is bad crouded with hugh
rocks Scattered in every Direction which renders the pasage verry
Difficuelt a little above this rapid on the Lard. Side emence piles of
rocks appears as if Sliped from the Clifts under which they lay, passed
great number of rocks in every direction Scattered in the river 5
Lodges a little below on the Stard. Side, and one lodge on an Island
near the Stard. Shore opposit to which is a verry bad rapid, thro which
we found much dificuelty in passing, the river is Crouded with rocks in
every direction, after Passing this dificult rapid to the mouth of a
Small river on the Larboard Side 40 yards wide descharges but little
water at this time, and appears to take its Sourse in the Open plains
to the S. E. from this place I proceved Some fiew Small pines on the
tops of the high hills and bushes in the hollars. imediately above &
below this little river comences a rapid which is crouded with large
rocks in every direction, the pasage both crooked and dificuelt, we
halted at a Lodge to examine those noumerous Islands of rock which apd.
to extend maney miles below,-. great numbs. of Indians came in Canoes
to View us at this place, after passing this rapid which we
accomplished without loss; winding through between the hugh rocks for
about 2 miles-. (from this rapid the Conocil mountain is S. W. which
the Indians inform me is not far to the left of the great falls; this I
call the Timm or falls mountain it is high and the top is covered with
Snow) imediately below the last rapids there is four Lodges of Indians
on the Stard. Side, proceeded on about two miles lower and landed and
encamped near five Lodges of nativs, drying fish those are the
relations of those at the Great falls, they are pore and have but
little wood which they bring up the river from the falls as they Say,
we purchased a little wood to cook our Dog meat and fish; those people
did not recive us at first with the same cordiality of those above,
they appeare to be the Same nation Speak the Same language with a
little curruption of maney words Dress and fish in the Same way, all of
whome have pierced noses and the men when Dressed ware a long taper'd
piece of Shell or beed put through the nose-this part of the river is
furnished with fine Springs which either rise high up the Sides of the
hills or on the bottom near the river and run into the river. the hills
are high and rugid a fiew scattering trees to be Seen on them either
Small pine or Scrubey white oke.

The probable reason of the Indians residing on the Stard. Side of this
as well as the waters of Lewis's River is their fear of the Snake
Indians who reside, as they nativs Say on a great river to the South,
and are at war with those tribes, one of the Old Chiefs who accompanies
us pointed out a place on the lard. Side where they had a great battle,
not maney years ago, in which maney were killed on both Sides-, one of
our party J. Collins presented us with Some verry good beer made of the
Pashi-co-quar-mash bread, which bread is the remains of what was laid
in as Stores of Provisions, at the first flat heads or Cho-punnish
Nation at the head of the Kosskoske river which by being frequently wet
molded & Sowered &c. we made 33 miles to day.

October 22nd Tuesday 1805
a fine morning Calm. we Set out at 9 oClock and on the Course S. 52 deg. W.
10 miles passed lodges & Inds. and rapids as mentioned in the Cours of
yesterday, from the expiration of

Took our Baggage & formed a Camp below the rapids in a cove on the
Stard Side the distance 1200 yards haveing passed at the upper end of
the portage 17 Lodges of Indians, below the rapids & above the Camp 5
large Loges of Indians, great numbers of baskets of Pounded fish on the
rocks Islands & near their Lodges thos are neetly pounded & put in
verry new baskets of about 90 or 100 pounds wight. hire Indians to take
our heavy articles across the portage purchased a Dog for Supper Great
numbers of Indians view us, we with much dificuelty purchd. as much
wood as Cooked our dogs this evening, our men all in helth--The Indians
have their grave yards on an Island in the rapids. The Great Chief of
those Indians is out hunting. no Indians reside on the Lard Side for
fear of the Snake Indians with whome they are at war and who reside on
the large fork on the lard. a little above




[Clark, October 22, 1805]
October 22d Tuesday 1805
A fine morning calm and fare we Set out at 9 oClock passed a verry bad
rapid at the head of an Island close under the Stard. Side, above this
rapid on the Stard Side is Six Lodges of nativs Drying fish, at 9 mls.
passed a bad rapid at the head of a large Island of high, uneaven
rocks, jutting over the water, a Small Island in a Stard. Bend opposit
the upper point, on which I counted 20 parcels of dryed and pounded
fish; on the main Stard Shore opposit to this Island five Lodges of
Indians are Situated Several Indians in Canoes killing fish with gigs,
&c. opposit the center of this Island of rocks which is about 4 miles
long we discovered the enterence of a large river on the Lard. Side
which appeared to Come from the S. E.--we landed at Some distance above
the mouth of this river and Capt. Lewis and my Self Set out to view
this river above its mouth, as our rout was intersepted by a deep
narrow Chanel which runs out of this river into the Columbia a little
below the place we landed, leaveing a high dry rich Island of about 400
yards wide and 800 yards long here we Seperated, I proceeded on to the
river and Struck it at the foot of a verry Considerable rapid, here I
beheld an emence body of water Compressd in a narrow Chanel of about
200 yds in width, fomeing over rocks maney of which presented their
tops above the water, when at this place Capt. Lewis joined me haveing
delayed on the way to examine a root of which the nativs had been
digging great quantities in the bottoms of this River. at about two
miles above this River appears to be confined between two high hils
below which it divided by numbers of large rocks, and Small Islands
covered with a low groth of timber, and has a rapid as far as the
narrows three Small Islands in the mouth of this River, this River
haveing no Indian name that we could find out, except "the River on
which the Snake Indians live," we think it best to leave the nameing of
it untill our return.

we proceeded on pass the mouth of this river at which place it appears
to discharge 1/4 as much water as runs down the Columbia. at two miles
below this River passed Eight Lodges on the Lower point of the Rock
Island aforesaid at those Lodges we saw large logs of wood which must
have been rafted down the To war-ne hi ooks River, below this Island on
the main Stard Shore is 16 Lodges of nativs; here we landed a fiew
minits to Smoke, the lower point of one Island opposit which heads in
the mouth of Towarnehiooks River which I did not observe untill after
passing these lodges about 1/2 a mile lower passed 6 more Lodges on the
Same Side and 6 miles below the upper mouth of Towarnehiooks River the
comencement of the pitch of the Great falls, opposit on the Stard. Side
is 17 Lodges of the nativs we landed and walked down accompanied by an
old man to view the falls, and the best rout for to make a portage
which we Soon discovered was much nearest on the Stard. Side, and the
distance 1200 yards one third of the way on a rock, about 200 yards
over a loose Sand collected in a hollar blown by the winds from the
bottoms below which was disagreeable to pass, as it was Steep and
loose. at the lower part of those rapids we arrived at 5 Large Lodges
of nativs drying and prepareing fish for market, they gave us
Philburts, and berries to eate, we returned droped down to the head of
the rapids and took every article except the Canoes across the portag
where I had formed a camp on ellegable Situation for the protection of
our Stores from Thieft, which we were more fearfull of, than their
arrows. we despatched two men to examine the river on the opposit Side,
and reported that the Canoes could be taken down a narrow Chanel on the
opposit Side after a Short portage at the head of the falls, at which
place the Indians take over their Canoes. Indians assisted us over the
portage with our heavy articles on their horses, the waters is divided
into Several narrow chanels which pass through a hard black rock
forming Islands of rocks at this Stage of the water, on those Islands
of rocks as well as at and about their Lodges I observe great numbers
of Stacks of pounded Salmon neetly preserved in the following manner, i
e after Suffiently Dried it is pounded between two Stones fine, and put
into a speces of basket neetly made of grass and rushes of better than
two feet long and one foot Diamiter, which basket is lined with the
Skin of Salmon Stretched and dried for the purpose, in theis it is
pressed down as hard as is possible, when full they Secure the open
part with the fish Skins across which they fasten tho the loops of the
basket that part very Securely, and then on a Dry Situation they Set
those baskets the Corded part up, their common Custom is to Set 7 as
close as they can Stand and 5 on the top of them, and secure them with
mats which is raped around them and made fast with cords and Covered
also with mats, those 12 baskets of from 90 to 100 w. each form a
Stack. thus preserved those fish may be kept Sound and Sweet Several
years, as those people inform me, Great quantities as they inform us
are Sold to the whites people who visit the mouth of this river as well
as to the nativs below.

on one of those Island I saw Several tooms but did not visit them The
principal Chiefs of the bands resideing about this Place is out hunting
in the mountains to the S. W.--no Indians reside on the S. W.side of
this river for fear (as we were informed) of the Snake Indians, who are
at war with the tribes on this river---they represent the Snake Indians
as being verry noumerous, and resideing in a great number of villages
on Towarnehiooks River which falls in 6 miles above on the Lard. Side
and is reaches a great ways and is large a little abov its mouth at
which part it is not intersepted with rapids, they inform that one
considerable rapid & maney Small ones in that river, and that the Snake
live on Salmon, and they go to war to their first villages in 12 days,
the Couse they pointed is S. E. or to the S of S. E. we are visited by
great numbers of Indians to Day to view us, we purchased a Dog for
Supper, Some fish and with dificuelty precured as much wood as Cooked
Supper, which we also purchased we made 19 miles to day




[Clark, October 23, 1805]
October 23rd (Saturday) Wednesday 1805
Took the Canoes over the Portage on the Lard. Side with much
dificuelty, description on another Paper one Canoe got loose & cought
by the Indians which we were obliged to pay. our old Chiefs over herd
the Indians from below Say they would try to kill us & informed us of
it, we have all the arm examined and put in order, all th Inds leave us
early, Great numbers of flees on the Lard Side--Shot a Sea Oter which I
did not get, Great Numbers about those rapids we purchased 8 dogs,
Small & fat for our party to eate, the Indians not verry fond of
Selling their good fish, compells us to make use of dogs for food
Exchanged our Small canoe for a large & a very new one built for riding
the waves obsd Merdn. altd. 66 deg. 27' 30" Latd. prodsd. 45 deg. 42' 57 3/10" North




[Clark, October 23, 1805]
October 23d Wednesday 1805
a fine morning, I with the greater part of the men Crossed in the
Canoes to opposit Side above the falls and hauled them across the
portage of 457 yards which is on the Lard. Side and certainly the best
side to pass the canoes I then decended through a narrow chanel of
about 150 yards wide forming a kind of half circle in it course of a
mile to a pitch of 8 feet in which the chanel is divided by 2 large
rocks at this place we were obliged to let the Canoes down by Strong
ropes of Elk Skin which we had for the purpose, one Canoe in passing
this place got loose by the Cords breaking, and was cought by the
Indians below. I accomplished this necessary business and landed Safe
with all the Canoes at our Camp below the falls by 3 oClock P.M. nearly
covered with flees which were So thick amongst the Straw and fish Skins
at the upper part of the portage at which place the nativs had been
Camped not long Since; that every man of the party was obliged to Strip
naked dureing the time of takeing over the canoes, that they might have
an oppertunity of brushing the flees of their legs and bodies--Great
numbers of Sea Otters in the river below the falls, I Shot one in the
narrow chanel to day which I could not get. Great numbers of Indians
visit us both from above and below---one of the old Chiefs who had
accompanied us from the head of the river, informed us that he herd the
Indians Say that the nation below intended to kill us, we examined all
the arms &c. complete the amunition to 100 rounds. The nativs leave us
earlyer this evening than usial, which gives a Shadow of Confirmation
to the information of our Old Chief, as we are at all times & places on
our guard, are under no greater apprehention than is common.

we purchased 8 Small fat dogs for the party to eate the nativs not
being fond of Selling their good fish, compells us to make use of Dog
meat for food, the flesh of which the most of the party have become
fond of from the habits of useing it for Some time past. The Altitude
of this day 66 deg. 27' 30" gave for Latd. 45 deg. 42' 57 1/10 N.

I observed on the beach near the Indian Lodges two Canoes butifull of
different Shape & Size to what we had Seen above wide in the midde and
tapering to each end, on the bow curious figures were Cut in the wood
&c. Capt. Lewis went up to the Lodges to See those Canoes and exchanged
our Smallest Canoe for one of them by giveing a Hatchet & few trinkets
to the owner who informed that he purchased it of a white man below for
a horse, these Canoes are neeter made than any I have ever Seen and
Calculated to ride the waves, and carry emence burthens, they are dug
thin and are suported by cross pieces of about 1 inch diamuter tied
with Strong bark thro holes in the Sides. our two old Chiefs appeared
verry uneasy this evening.

October 24th Thursday 1805
a fine morning the Indians approached us with caution. our 2 old Chiefs
deturmin to return home, Saying they were at war with Indians below and
they would kill them we pursuaded them to Stay 2 nights longer with us,
with a view to make a peace with those Indians below as well as to have
them with us dureing our Delay with this tribe. Capt Lewis went to view
the falls I Set out with the party at 9 oClock a m at 21/2 miles passed
a rock which makes from the Stard Side 4 Lodges above 1 below and
Confined the river in a narrow channel of about 45 yards this continued
for about 1/4 of a mile & widened to about 200 yards, in those narrows
the water was agitated in a most Shocking manner boils Swell & whorl
pools, we passed with great risque It being impossible to make a
portage of the Canoes, about 2 miles lower passed a verry Bad place
between 2 rocks one large & in the middle of the river here our Canoes
took in Some water, I put all the men who Could not Swim on Shore; &
Sent a fiew articles Such as guns & papers, and landed at a village of
20 houses on the Stard Side in a Deep bason where the river ap-prd. to
be blocked up with emence rocks I walked down and examined the pass
found it narrow, and one verry bad place a little in the narrows I
pursued this Chanel which is from 50 to 100 yards wide and Swels and
boils with a most Tremendeous manner; prosued this channel 5 ms &
returned found Capt Lewis & a Chief from below with maney of his men on
a visit to us, one of our Party Pete Crusat played on the violin which
pleased the Savage, the men danced, Great numbers of Sea Orter Pole
Cats about those fishories. the houses of those Indians are 20 feet
Square and Sunk 8 feet under ground & Covered with bark with a Small
door round at top rose about 18 Inches above ground, to keep out the
Snow I saw 107 parcels of fish Stacked, and great quantites in the
houses




[Clark, October 24, 1805]
October 24th Thursday 1805
The morning fare after a beautifull night, the nativs approached us
this morning with great caution. our two old chiefs expressed a desire
to return to their band from this place, Saying "that they Could be of
no further Service to us, as their nation extended no further down the
river than those falls, and as the nation below had expressed hostile
intentions against us, would Certainly kill them; perticularly as They
had been at war with each other;" we requested them to Stay with us two
nights longer, and we would See the nation below and make a peace
between them, they replied they "were anxious to return and See our
horses" we insisted on their Staying with us two nights longer to which
they agreed; our views were to detain those Chiefs with us untill we
Should pass the next falls, which we were told was verry bad, and at no
great distance below, that they might inform us of any designs of the
nativs, and if possible to bring about a peace between them and the
tribes below.

The first pitch of this falls is 20 feet perpendicular, then passing
thro a narrow Chanel for 1 mile to a rapid of about 18 feet fall below
which the water has no perceptable fall but verry rapid See Sketch No.
1. It may be proper here to remark that from Some obstruction below,
the cause of which we have not yet learned, the water in high fluds
(which are in the Spring) rise below these falls nearly to a leavel
with the water above the falls; the marks of which can be plainly
trac'd around the falls. at that Stage of the water the Salmon must
pass up which abounds in Such great numbers above--below those falls
are Salmon trout and great numbers of the heads of a Species of trout
Smaller than the Salmon. those fish they catch out of the Salmon
Season, and are at this time in the act of burrying those which they
had drid for winter food. the mode of buring those fish is in holes of
various Sizes, lined with Straw on which they lay fish Skins in which
they inclose the fish which is laid verry close, and then Covered with
earth of about 12 or 15 inches thick. Capt Lewis and three men crossed
the river and on the opposit Side to view the falls which he had not
yet taken a full view of--At 9 oClock a.m. I Set out with the party and
proceeded on down a rapid Stream of about 400 yards wide at 21/2 miles
the river widened into a large bason to the Stard. Side on which there
is five Lodges of Indians. here a tremendious black rock Presented
itself high and Steep appearing to choke up the river nor could I See
where the water passed further than the Current was drawn with great
velocity to the Lard Side of this rock at which place I heard a great
roreing. I landed at the Lodges and the natives went with me to the top
of this rock which makes from the Stard. Side; from the top of which I
could See the dificuelties we had to pass for Several miles below; at
this place the water of this great river is compressed into a Chanel
between two rocks not exceeding forty five yards wide and continues for
a 1/4 of a mile when it again widens to 200 yards and continues this
width for about 2 miles when it is again intersepted by rocks. This
obstruction in the river accounts for the water in high floods riseing
to Such a hite at the last falls. The whole of the Current of this
great river must at all Stages pass thro this narrow chanel of 45 yards
wide. as the portage of our canoes over this high rock would be
impossible with our Strength, and the only danger in passing thro those
narrows was the whorls and Swills arriseing from the Compression of the
water, and which I thought (as also our principal watermen Peter
Crusat) by good Stearing we could pass down Safe, accordingly I detur
mined to pass through this place notwithstanding the horrid appearance
of this agitated gut Swelling, boiling & whorling in every direction
(which from the top of the rock did not appear as bad as when I was in
it;) however we passed Safe to the astonishment of all the Inds. of the
last Lodges who viewed us from the top of the rock. passed one Lodge
below this rock and halted on the Stard. Side to view a verry bad
place, the Current divided by 2 Islands of rocks the lower of them
large and in the middle of the river, this place being verry bad I Sent
by land all the men who could not Swim and Such articles as was most
valuable to us Such as papers Guns & amunition, and proceeded down with
the Canoes two at a time to a village of 20 wood housies in a Deep bend
to the Stard. Side below which a rugid black rock about 20 feet biter
than the Common high fluds of the river with Several dry Chapels which
appeared to Choke the river up quite across; this I took to be the 2d
falls or the place the nativs above call timm, The nativs of this
village reived me verry kindly, one of whome envited me into his house,
which I found to be large and comodious, and the first wooden houses in
which Indians have lived Since we left those in the vicinty of the
Illinois, they are scattered permiscuisly on a elivated Situation near
a mound of about 30 feet above the Common leavel, which mound has Some
remains of houses and has every appearance of being artificial--those
houses are about the Same Shape Size and form 20 feet wide and 30 feet
long with one Dore raised 18 Inches above ground, they are 291/2 inches
high & 14 wide, forming in a half Circle above those houses were Sunk
into the earth Six feet, the roofs of them was Supported by a ridge
pole resting on three Strong pieces of Split timber thro one of which
the dore was cut that and the walls the top of which was just above
ground Suported a certain number of Spars which are Covered with the
Bark of the white Ceadar, or Arber Vitea; and the whole attached and
Secured by the fibers of the Cedar. the eaves at or near the earth, the
gable ends and Side walls are Secured with Split boards which is
Seported on iner Side with Strong pieces of timber under the eves &c.
to keep those pieces errect & the earth from without pressing in the
boards, Suported by Strong posts at the Corners to which those poles
were attached to give aditional Strength, Small openings were left
above the ground, for the purpose, as I conjectured, of deschargeing
Their arrows at a besiegeing enimey; Light is admited Thro an opening
at top which also Serves for the Smoke to pass through. one half of
those houses is apropriated for the Storeing away Dried & pounded fish
which is the principal food The other part next the dore is the part
occupied by the nativs who have beds raised on either Side, with a fire
place in the center of this Space each house appeared to be occupied by
about three families; that part which is apropriated for fish was
crouded with that article, and a fiew baskets of burries--I dispatched
a Sufficent number of the good Swimers back for the 2 canoes above the
last rapid and with 2 men walked down three miles to examine the river
Over a bed of rocks, which the water at verry high fluds passes over,
on those rocks I Saw Several large Scaffols on which the Indians dry
fish; as this is out of Season the poles on which they dry those fish
are tied up verry Securely in large bundles and put upon the Scaffolds,
I counted 107 Stacks of dried pounded fish in different places on those
rocks which must have contained io,ooo w. of neet fish, The evening
being late I could not examine the river to my Satisfaction, the Chanel
is narrow and compressed for about 2 miles, when it widens into a deep
bason to the Stard. Side, & again contracts into a narrow chanel
divided by a rock I returned through a rockey open countrey infested
with pole-cats to the village where I met with Capt. Lewis the two old
Chiefs who accompanied us & the party & canoes who had all arrived
Safe; the Canoes haveing taken in Some water at the last rapids. here
we formed a Camp near the Village, The principal Chief from the nation
below with Several of his men visited us, and afforded a favourable
oppertunity of bringing about a Piece and good understanding between
this chief and his people and the two Chiefs who accompanied us which
we have the Satisfaction to Say we have accomplished, as we have every
reason to believe and that those two bands or nations are and will be
on the most friendly terms with each other. gave this Great Chief a
Medal and Some other articles, of which he was much pleased, Peter
Crusat played on the violin and the men danced which delighted the
nativs, who Shew every civility towards us. we Smoked with those people
untill late at night, when every one retired to rest.




[Clark, October 25, 1805]
October 25th Friday 1805
A Cold morning, we deturmined to attempt the Chanel after brackfast I
took down all the party below the bad places with a load & one Canoe
passed well, a 2d passed well I had men on the Shore with ropes to
throw in in Case any acidence happened at the Whirl &c--the Inds on the
rocks veiwing us the 3rd Canoe nearly filled with water we got her Safe
to Shore. The last Canoe Came over well which to me was truly
gratifying Set out and had not passed 2 mils before 3 Canoes run
against a rock in the river with great force no damg. met with a 2d
Chief of the nation from hunting, we Smoked with him and his party and
gave a medal of The Small Size & Set out passed great numbers of rocks,
good water and Came to at a high point of rocks below the mouth of a
Creek which falls in on the Lard Side and head up towards the high Snow
mountain to the S W. this Creek is 20 yards wide and has Some beaver
Signs at its mouth river about 1/2 a mile wide and Crouded with Sea
otters, & drum was Seen this evening we took possession of a high Point
of rocks to defend our Selves in Case the threts of those Indians below
Should be put in execution against us. Sent out Some hunters to look if
any Signs of game, one man killed a Small deer & Several others Seen I
killed a goose, and Suped hartily on venison & goose. Camped on the
rock guard under the hill.




[Clark, October 25, 1805]
October 25th Friday 1805
a cool morning Capt Lewis and my Self walked down to See the place the
Indians pointed out as the worst place in passing through the gut,
which we found difficuelt of passing without great danger, but as the
portage was impractiable with our large Canoes, we Concluded to Make a
portage of our most valuable articles and run the canoes thro
accordingly on our return divided the party Some to take over the
Canoes, and others to take our Stores across a portage of a mile to a
place on the Chanel below this bad whorl & Suck, with Some others I had
fixed on the Chanel with roapes to throw out to any who Should
unfortunately meet with difficuelty in passing through; great number of
Indians viewing us from the high rocks under which we had to pass, the
3 firt Canoes passed thro very well, the 4th nearly filled with water,
the last passed through by takeing in a little water, thus Safely below
what I conceved to be the worst part of this Chanel, felt my Self
extreamly gratified and pleased. we loaded the Canoes & Set out, and
had not proceeded, more than two mile before the unfortunate Canoe
which filled crossing the bad place above, run against a rock and was
in great danger of being lost, This Chanel is through a hard rough
black rock, from 50-100 yards wide. Swelling and boiling in a most
tremendious maner Several places on which the Indians inform me they
take the Salmon as fast as they wish; we passed through a deep bason to
the Stard Side of 1 mile below which the River narrows and divided by a
rock The Curent we found quit jentle, here we met with our two old
Chiefs who had been to a village below to Smoke a friendly pipe, and at
this place they met the Cheif & party from the village above on his
return from hunting all of whome were then crossing over their horses,
we landed to Smoke a pipe with this Chief whome we found to be a bold
pleasing looking man of about 50 years of age dressd. in a war jacket a
cap Legins & mockersons. he gave us Some meat of which he had but
little and informed us he in his rout met with a war party of Snake
Indians from the great river of the S. E. which falls in a few miles
above and had a fight. we gave this Chief a Medal, &c. a parting Smoke
with our two faithful friends the Chiefs who accompanied us from the
head of the river, (who had purchased a horse each with 2 robes and
intended to return on horse back) we proceeded on down the water fine,
rocks in every derection for a fiew miles when the river widens and
becoms a butifull jentle Stream of about half a mile wide, Great
numbers of the Sea Orter about those narrows and both below and above.
we Came too, under a high point of rocks on the Lard. Side below a
creek of 20 yards wide and much water, as it was necessary to make Some
Selestial observations we formed our Camp on the top of a high point of
rocks, which forms a kind of fortification in the Point between the
river & Creek, with a boat guard, this Situation we Concieve well
Calculated for defence, and Conveniant to hunt under the foots of the
mountain to the West & S. W. where timber of different kinds grows, and
appears to be handsom Coverts for the Deer, in oke woods, Sent out
hunters to examine for game G. D. Killed a Small Deer & other Saw much
Sign, I killed a goose in the creek which was verry fat--one of the
guard saw a Drum fish to day as he Conceved our Situation well
Calculated to defend our Selves from any designs of the natives, Should
They be enclined to attack us.

This little Creek heads in the range of mountains which run S S W & N W
for a long distance on which is Scattering pine white Oake &c. The
Pinical of the round toped mountain which we Saw a Short distance below
the forks of this river is S. 43 deg. W. of us and abt 37 miles, it is at
this time toped with Snow we called this the falls mountain or Timm
mountain. The face of the Countrey, on both Side of the river above and
about the falls, is Steep ruged and rockey open and contain but a Small
preportion of erbage, no timber a fiew bushes excepted, The nativs at
the upper falls raft their timber down Towarnehooks River & those at
the narrows take theirs up the river to the lower part of the narrows
from this Creek, and Carry it over land 3 miles to their houses &c. at
the mouth of this creek Saw Some beaver Sign, and a Small wolf in a
Snare Set in the willows The Snars of which I saw Several made for to
catch wolves, are made as follows vz: a long pole which will Spring is
made fast with bark to a willow, on the top of this pole a String




[Clark, October 26, 1805]
October 26th 1805 Saturday
a fine morning Sent out Six men to hunt deer & Collect rozin to Pitch
our Canoes, had all our articles put out to dry--Canoes drawed out and
repaired, the injories recved in drawing them over the rocks, every
article wet in the Canoe which nearly Sunk yesterday-

In the evening 2 Chief and 15 men came over in a Single Canoe, those
Chf's proved to be the 2 great Chiefs of the tribes above, one gave me
a dressed Elk Skin, and gave us Som deer meet, and 2 Cakes of white
bread made of white roots, we gave to each Chief a Meadel of the Small
Size a red Silk handkerchief & a knife to the 1st a arm ban & a pin of
Paint & a Comb to his Son a Piece of riben tied to a tin gorget and 2
hams of Venison They deturmined to Stay with us all night, we had a
fire made for them & one man played on the violin which pleased them
much my Servent danced--our hunters killed five Deer, 4 verry large
gray Squirrels, a goose & Pheasent, one man giged a Salmon trout which
we had fried in a little Bears oil which a Chief gave us yesterday and
I think the finest fish I ever tasted, Saw great numbers of white Crams
flying in Different directions verry high. The river has rose nearly 8
Inches to day and has every appearance of a tide, from what Cause I
can't Say--our hunters Saw Elk & bear signs to day in the white oake
woods the Country to the Lard is broken Country thinly timbered with
pine and white oake, a mountain which I must call Timm or falls
Mountain rises verry high and bears to S W the Course it has bore Sinc
we first Saw it. our men danced to night. dried all our wet articles
and repaired our Canoes

The flees my Self and the men got on them in passing thro the plains
the Indians had lately lived in Lodges on the Lard. Side at the falls,
are very troublesom and with every exertion the men Can't get rid of
them, perticilarly as they have no clothes to change those which they
wore Those Indians are at Ware with the Snake Indians on the river
which falls in a few miles above this and have lately had a battle with
them, their loss I cannot lern.




[Clark, October 26, 1805]
October 26th Saturday 1805
A fine morning Sent Six men out to hunt Deer, and Collect rozin to
pitch the Canoes which has become verry leakey, by frequently hauling
them over rocks &c as well Striking rocks frequently in passing down.
all our articles we have exposed to the Sun to Dry; and the Canoes
drawn out and turned up--maney of our Stores entirely Spoiled by being
repeetedly wet; A number of Indians came to the Oposit Side of the
river in the fore part of the day and Shew that they were anxious to
Cross to us, we did not think proper to cross them in our Canoes and
did not Send for them. in the evening two Chiefs and 15 men came over
in a Small Canoe, those two Chiefs proved to be the two Principal
Chiefs of the tribes above at the falls, and above, who was out hunting
at the time we passed their bands; one of those Chiefs made Capt Lewis
and my Self each a Small present of Deer meat, and Small Cakes of white
bread made of roots. we gave to each Chief a Meadel of the Small Size a
red Silk handkerchief, arm band, Knife & a piece of Paint, and
acknowledged them as chiefs; as we thought it necessary at this time to
treat those people verry friendly & ingratiate our Selves with them, to
insure us a kind & friendly reception on our return, we gave Small
presents to Several, and half a Deer to them to eate. we had also a
fire made for those people to Sit around in the middle of our Camp, and
Peter Crusat Played on the violin, which pleased those nativs
exceedingly. the two Chiefs and Several men deturmined to delay all
night (yorked Danced for the Inds) with us all the others returned,
leaving the horses for those who Staied on the opposit Side. our
hunters returned in the evening Killed five Deer, four verry large grey
Squirels and a grouse. one of the guard at the river guiged a Salmon
Trout, which we had fried in a little Bears Oil which the Chief we
passed below the narrows gave us; this I thought one of the most
delicious fish I have ever tasted Great numbers of white Crain flying
in different Directions verry high--The river rose 8 Inches today from
what cause I cannot Say certainly, as the tides cannot effect the river
here as there is a falls below, I conjecture that the rise is owing to
the winds which has Set up the river for 24 hours past. our hunters
inform that the countrey back is broken, Stoney and thinly timbered
with pine and White Oake. They Saw Elk & Bear Sign in the mountains.
Dried all our wet articles and repared our Canoes to day, and the Party
amused themselves at night danceing. The Flees which the party got on
them at the upper & great falls, are very troublesom and dificuelt to
get rid of, perticularly as the men have not a Change of Clothes to put
on, they Strip off their Clothes and kill the flees, dureing which time
they remain neckid.

The nations in the vicinity of this place is at War with the Snake
Indians who they Say are noumerous and live on the river we passed
above the falls on the Same Side on which we have encamped, and the
nearest town is about four days march they pointed nearly S. E. and
informed that they had a battle with those Inds. laterly, their loss I
could not assertain

and party Continue with us, we treat them well give them to eate &
Smoke, they were joined by Seven others, from below who Stayed about 3
hours and returned down the river in a pet, Soon after the Chiefs
deturmined to go home we had them put across the river the wind verry
high, we took a vocabelary of the Languages of the 2 nations, the one
liveing at the Falls call themselves E-nee-shur The other resideing at
the levels or narrows in a village on the Std. Side call themselves
E-chee-lute not withstanding those people live only 6 miles apart, but
fiew words of each others language--the language of those above having
great Similarity with those tribes of flat heads we have passed--all
have the Clucking tone anexed which is predomint. above, all flatten
the heads of their female children near the falls, and maney above
follow the Same Custom The language of the Che-luc-it-to-quar a fiew
miles below is different from both in a Small degree. The wind
increased in the evening and blew verry hard from the Same point W. day
fair and Cold--The Creek at which we are Encamped is Called by the
natives-Que-nett Some words with Shabono about his duty--The pinical of

to eate & Smoke Several of those from below returned down the river in
a bad humer, haveing got into this pet by being prevented doeing as
they wished with our articles which was then exposed to dry--we took a
Vocabelary of the Languages of those two chiefs which are verry
different notwithstanding they are Situated within Six miles of each
other, Those at the great falls Call themselves E-nee-shur and are
understood on the river above. Those at the Great Narrows Call
themselves Eche-lute and is understood below, maney words of those
people are the Same, and Common to all the flat head Bands which we
have passed on the river, all have the clucking tone anexed which is
prodomonate above. all the Bands flatten the heads of the female
Children, and maney of the male children also. Those two Chief leave us
this evening and returned to their bands, the wind verry high & from
the West, day proved fair and Cool.

The nativs Call this Creek near which we are encamped-Que-nett.

October 28th Monday 1805
A cool windey morning we loaded our Canoes and Set out at 9 oClock,
a.m. as we were about to Set out 3 canoes from above and 2 from below
came to view us in one of those Canoes I observed an Indian with round
hat jacket & wore his hair cued we proceeded on river inclosed on each
Side in high Clifts of about 90 feet of loose dark coloured rocks at
four miles we landed at a village of 8 houses on the Stard. Side under
Some rugid rocks, Those people call themselves Chil-luckit-tequaw, live
in houses Similar to those described, Speake Somewhat different
language with maney words the Same & understand those in their
neighbourhood Cap Lewis took a vocabilary of this Language I entered
one of the houses in which I Saw a British musket, a cutlass and
Several brass Tea kittles of which they appeared verry fond Saw them
boiling fish in baskets with Stones, I also Saw figures of animals &
men Cut & painted on boards in one Side of the house which they
appeared to prize, but for what purpose I will not venter to Say,-.
here we purchased five Small Dogs, Some dried buries, & white bread
made of roots, the wind rose and we were obliged to lie by all day at 1
mile below on the Lard. Side. we had not been long on Shore before a
Canoe came up with a man woman & 2 children, who had a fiew roots to
Sell, Soon after maney others joined them from above, The wind which is
the cause of our delay, does not retard the motions of those people at
all, as their canoes are calculated to ride the highest waves, they are
built of white cedar or Pine verry light wide in the middle and tapers
at each end, with aperns, and heads of animals carved on the bow, which
is generally raised. Those people make great use of Canoes, both for
transpotation and fishing, they also use of bowls & baskets made of
Grass & Splits to hold water and boil their fish & meat. Maney of the
nativs of the last Village Came down Set and Smoke with us, wind blew
hard accompanied with rain all the evening, our Situation not a verry
good one for an encampment, but Such as it is we are obliged to put up
with, the harbor is a Safe one, we encamped on the Sand wet and
disagreeable one Deer killed this evening, and another wounded near our
Camp.

A cloudy morning wind from the West but not hard, we Set out at day
light, and proceeded on about five miles Came too on the Stard. Side at
a village of 7 houses built in the Same form and materials of those
above, here we found the Chief we had Seen at the long narrows named
____

we entered his lodge and he gave us to eate Pounded fish, bread made of
roots, Filberts nuts, & the berries of Sackecomme. we gave to each
woman of the lodge a brace of Ribon of which they were much pleased.
each of those houses may be calculated to contain 8 men and 30 Soles,
they are hospitable and good humered Speak the Same language of the
inhabitants of the last village, we call this the friendly village. I
observed in the lodge of the Chief Sundery articles which must have
been precured from the white people, Such a Scarlet & blue Cloth Sword
Jacket & hat. I also observed two wide Split boards with images on them
Cut and painted in emitation of a man; I pointed to this image and
asked a man to what use he put them to, he Said Something the only word
I understood was "good," and then Steped to the image and took out his
Bow & quiver to Show me, and Some other of his war emplemints, from
behind it.

The Chief then directed his wife to hand him his medison bag which he
opened and Showed us 14 fingers which he Said was the fingers of his
enemies which he had taken in war, and pointed to S. E. from which
direction I concluded they were Snake Indians; this is the first
Instance I ever knew of the Indians takeing any other trofea of their
exploits off the dead bodies of their Enimies except the Scalp.--The
Chief painted those fingers with Several other articles which was in
his bag red and Securely put them back, haveing first mad a Short
harrang which I Suppose was bragging of what he had done in war. we
purchased 12 Dogs and 4 Sacks of fish, & Some fiew ascid berries, after
brackfast we proceeded on, the mountains are high on each Side,
