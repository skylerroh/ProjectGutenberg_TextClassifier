two centres being about thirteen miles apart, and the line joining
them running nearly the same distance to the west of Charleston. The
approximate depth of the principal focus is given as twelve miles,
with a possible error of less than two miles; that of the minor one as
roughly eight miles.

The Charleston earthquake was felt as a tremor of more or less force
through a wide area, embracing 900,000 square miles, and affecting
nearly the whole country east of the Mississippi. It is said that the
yield of the Pennsylvania natural gas wells decreased, and that a geyser
in the Yellowstone valley burst into action after four years of rest.
The movement of the earth-wave was in general north and south, deflected
to east and west, and the snake-like fashion in which rails on the
railroad were bent indicated both a vertical and a lateral force.

This earthquake has been attributed to various causes, but geological
experts think that it was due to a slip in the crust along the
Appalachian Mountain chain. There is a line of weakness along the
eastern slope of this chain, characterized by fissures and faults, and
it was thought that a strain had been gradually brought to bear upon
this through the removal of earth from the land by rains and rivers and
its deposition in thick strata on the sea-bottom. It is supposed that
this variation in weight in time caused a yielding of the strata and a
slip seaward of the great coastal plain. Professor Mendenhall, however,
thinks it was due to a readjustment of the earth's crust to its
gradually sinking nucleus.



CHAPTER XVIII.

The Volcano and the Earthquake, Earth's Demons of Destruction.


To most of us, dwellers upon the face of the earth, this terrestrial
sphere is quite a comfortable place of residence. The forces of Nature
everywhere and at all times surround us, forces capable, if loosened
from their bonds, of bringing death and destruction to man and the work
of his hands. But usually they are mild and beneficent in their action,
not agents of destruction and lords of elemental misrule. The air,
without whose presence we could not survive a minute, is usually a
pleasant companion, now resting about us in soft calm, now passing by in
mild breezes. The alternation of summer and winter is to us generally an
agreeable relief from the monotony of a uniform climate. The variation
from sunlight to cloud, from dry weather to rainfall, is equally viewed
as a pleasant escape from the weariness of too great fixity of natural
conditions. The change from day to night, from hours of activity to
hours of slumber, are other agreeable variations in the events of our
daily life. In short, a great pendulum seems to be swinging above us,
held in Nature's kindly hand, and adapting its movements to our best
good and highest enjoyment.

But has Nature,--if we are justified in personifying the laws and forces
of the universe,--has mother Nature really our pleasure and benefit in
mind, or does she merely suffer us to enjoy life like so many summer
insects, until she is in the mood to sweep us like leaves from her
path? It must seem the latter to many of the inhabitants of the earth,
especially to the dwellers in certain ill-conditioned regions. For all
the beneficent powers above named may at a moment's notice change to
destructive ones.


THE WIND IS A DEMON IN CHAINS


The wind, for instance, is a demon in chains. At times it breaks its
fetters and rushes on in mad fury, rending and destroying, and sweeping
such trifles as cities and those who dwell therein to common ruin.
Sunshine and rain are subject to like wild caprices. The sun may pour
down burning rays for weeks and months together, scorching the fertile
fields, drying up the life-giving streams, bringing famine and misery
to lands of plenty and comfort, almost making the blood to boil in our
veins. Its antithesis, the rainstorm, is at times a still more terrible
visitant. From the dense clouds pour frightful floods, rushing down
the lofty hills, sweeping over fertile plains, overflowing broad river
valleys, and, wherever they go, leaving terror and death in their path.
We may say the same of the alternation of the seasons. Summer, while
looked forward to with joyous anticipation, may bring us only
suffering by its too ardent grasp; and winter, often welcomed with like
pleasurable anticipations, may prove a period of terror from cold and
destitution.

Such is the make-up of the world in which we live, such the vagaries of
the forces which surround us. But those enumerated are not the whole.
Can we say, with a stamp of the foot upon the solid earth, "Here at
least I have something I can trust; let the winds blow and the rains
descend, let the summer scorch and the winter chill, the good earth
still stands firm beneath me, and of it at least I am sure?"

Who says so speaks hastily and heedlessly, for the earth can show itself
as unstable as the air, and our solid footing become as insecure as the
deck of a ship laboring in a storm at sea. The powers of the atmosphere,
great as they are and mighty for destruction as they may become, are at
times surpassed by those which abide within the earth, deep laid in the
so-called everlasting rocks, slumbering often through generations, but
at any time likely to awaken in wrath, to lift the earth into quaking
billows like those of the sea, or pour forth torrents of liquid fire
that flow in glowing and burning rivers over leagues of ruined land.
Such is the earth with which we have to deal, such the ruthless powers
of nature that spread around us and lurk beneath us, such the terrific
forces which only bide their time to break forth and sweep too-confident
man from the earth's smiling face.


THE SUBTERRANEAN POWERS


The subterranean powers here spoken of, those we had denominated earth's
demons of destruction, are the volcano and the earthquake, the great
moulding forces of the earth, tearing down to rebuild, rending to
reconstitute, and in this elemental work often bringing ruin to man's
boasted fanes and palaces.

No one who has ever seen a volcano or "burning mountain" casting forth
steam, huge red-hot stones, smoke, cinders and lava, can possibly forget
the grandeur of the spectacle. At night it is doubly terrible, when
the darkness shows the red-hot lava rolling in glowing streams down
the mountain's side. At times, indeed, the volcano is quiet, and only
a little smoke curls from its top. Even this may cease, and the once
burning summit may be covered over with trees and grass, like any other
hill. But deep down in the earth the gases and pent-up steam, are ever
preparing to force their way upward through the mountain, and to carry
with them dissolved rocks, and the stones which block their passage.
Sometimes, while all is calm and beautiful on the mountains, suddenly
deep-sounding noises are heard, the ground shakes, and a vast torrent
tears its way through the bowels of the volcano, and is flung hundreds
of feet high in the air, and, falling again to the earth, destroys every
living thing for miles around.

It is the same with the earthquake as with the volcano. The surface of
the earth is never quite still. Tremors are constantly passing onward
which can be distinguished by delicate instruments, but only rarely are
these of sufficient force to become noticeable, except by instrumental
means. At intervals, however, the power beneath the surface raises
the ground in long, billow-like motions, before which, when of violent
character, no edifice or human habitation can for a moment stand. The
earth is frequently rent asunder, great fissures and cavities being
formed. The course of rivers is changed and the waters are swallowed up
by fissures rent in the surface, while ruin impends in a thousand
forms. The cities become death pits and the cultivated fields are buried
beneath floods of liquid mud. Fortunately these convulsions, alike of
the earthquake and volcano, are comparative rarities and are confined
to limited regions of the earth's surface. What do we know of those
deep-lying powers, those vast buried forces dwelling in uneasy isolation
beneath our feet? With all our science we are but a step beyond the
ancients, to whom these were the Titans, great rebel giants whom Jupiter
overthrew and bound under the burning mountains, and whose throes of
agony shook the earth in quaking convulsions. To us the volcanic crater
is the mouth from which comes the fiery breath of demon powers which
dwell far down in the earth's crust. The Titans themselves were dwarfs
beside these mighty agents of destruction whose domain extends for
thousands of miles beneath the earth's surface and which in their
convulsions shake whole continents at once. Such was the case in 1812,
when the eruption of Mont Soufriere on St. Vincent, as told in a later
chapter, formed merely the closing event in a series of earthquakes
which had made themselves felt under thousands of miles of land.


ANCIENT AWE OF VOLCANOES


In olden times volcanoes were regarded with superstitious awe, and it
would have been considered highly impious to make any investigation of
their actions. We are told by Virgil that Mt. Etna marks the spot where
the gods in their anger buried Enceladus, one of the rebellious giants.
To our myth-making ancestors one of the volcanoes of the Mediterranean,
set on a small island of the Lipari group, was the workshop of Vulcan,
the god of fire, within whose depths he forged the thunderbolts of the
gods. From below came sounds as of a mighty hammer on a vast anvil.
Through the mountain vent came the black smoke and lurid glow from
the fires of Vulcan's forge. This old myth is in many respects more
consonant with the facts of nature than myths usually are. In agreement
with the theory of its internal forces, the mountain in question was
given the name of Volcano. To-day it is scarcely known at all, but its
name clings to all the fire-breathing mountains of the earth.

As before said, at the present day we are little in advance of the
ancients in actual knowledge of what is going on so far beneath our
feet. We speak of forces where they spoke of fettered giants, but can
only form theories where they formed myths. Is the earth's centre made
up of liquid fire? Does its rock crust resemble the thick ice crust on
the Arctic Seas, or is the earth, as later scientists believe, solid to
the core? Is it heated so fiercely, miles below our feet, that at every
release of pressure the solid rock bursts into molten lava? Is the steam
from the contact of underground rivers and deep-lying fires the origin
of the terrible rending powers of the volcano's depths? Truly we can
answer none of these questions with assurance, and can only guess
and conjecture from the few facts open to us what lies concealed far
beneath.


RARITY OF ANCIENT ACCOUNTS


In the history of earthquakes nothing is more remarkable than the
extreme fewness of those recorded before the beginning of the Christian
era, in comparison with those that have been registered since that time.
It is to be borne in mind, however, that before the birth of Christ only
a small portion of the globe was inhabited by those likely to make a
record of natural events. The vast apparent increase in the number
of earthquakes in recent times is owing to a greater knowledge of
the earth's surface and to the spread of civilization over lands once
inhabited by savages. The same is to be said of volcanic eruptions,
which also have apparently increased greatly since the beginning of the
Christian era. There may possibly have been a natural increase in these
phenomena, but this is hardly probable, the change being more likely due
to the increase in the number of observers.

The structure of a volcano is very different from that of other
mountains, really consisting of layers of lava and volcanic ashes,
alternating with each other and all sloping away from the center. These
elevations, in fact, are formed in a different manner from ordinary
mountains. The latter have been uplifted by the influence of pressure in
the interior of the earth, but the volcano is an immediate result of the
explosive force of which we have spoken, the mountain being gradually
built up by the lava and other materials which it has flung up from
below. In this way mountains of immense height and remarkable regularity
have been formed. Mount Orizabo, near the City of Mexico, for instance,
is a remarkably regular cone, undoubtedly formed in this way, and the
same may be said of Mount Mayon, on the Island of Luzon.

In many cases the irregularity of the volcano is due to subsequent
action of its forces, which may blow the mountain itself to pieces.
In the case of Krakatoa, in the East Indies, for instance, the whole
mountain was rent into fragments, which were flung as dust miles high
into the air. The main point we wish to indicate is that volcanoes are
never formed by ordinary elevating forces and that they differ in this
way from all other mountains. On the contrary, they have been piled up
like rubbish heaps, resembling the small mountains of coal dust near the
mouths of anthracite mines.

It is to the burning heat of the earth's crust and the influence of
pressure, and more largely to the influx of water to the molten rocks
which lie miles below the surface, that these convulsions of nature are
due. Water, on reaching these overheated strata, explodes into volumes
of steam, and if there is no free vent to the surface, it is apt to rend
the very mountain asunder in its efforts to escape. Such is supposed
to have been the case in the eruption of Krakatoa, and was probably the
case also in the recent case of Mt. Pelee.


GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF ERUPTIONS


If we should seek to give a general description of volcanic eruptions,
it would be in some such words as follows: An eruption is usually
preceded by earthquakes which affect the whole surrounding country,
and associated with which are underground explosions that seem like
the sound of distant artillery. The mountain quivers with internal
convulsions, due to the efforts of its confined forces to find an
opening. The drying up of wells and disappearance of springs are apt to
take place, the water sinking downward through cracks newly made in the
rocks. Finally the fierce unchained energy rends an opening through the
crater and an eruption begins. It comes usually with a terrible burst
that shakes the mountain to its foundation; explosions following rapidly
and with increasing violence, while steam issues and mounts upward in
a lofty column. The steam and escaping gases in their fierce outbreaks
hurl up into the air great quantities of solid rock torn from the sides
of the opening. The huge blocks, meeting each other in their rise and
fall, are gradually broken and ground into minute fragments, forming
dust or so-called ashes, often of extreme fineness, and in such
quantities as frequently to blot out the light of the sun. There is
another way in which a great deal of volcanic dust is made; the lava is
full of steam, which in its expansion tears the molten rock into atoms,
often converting it into the finest dust.

The eruption of Mt. Skaptar, in Iceland, in 1783, sent up such volumes
of dust that the atmosphere was loaded with it for months, and it
was carried to the northern part of Scotland, 600 miles away, in such
quantities as to destroy the crops. During the eruption of Tomboro, in
the East Indies, in 1815, so great was the quantity of dust thrown up
that it caused darkness at midday in Java 300 miles away and covered the
ground to a depth of several inches. Floating pumice formed a layer
on the ocean surface two and a half feet in thickness, through which
vessels had difficulty in forcing their way.

The steam which rises in large volumes into the air may become suddenly
condensed with the chill of the upper atmosphere and fall as rain,
torrents of which often follow an eruption. The rain, falling through
the clouds of volcanic dust, brings it to the earth as liquid mud, which
pours in thick streams down the sides of the mountain. The torrents of
flowing mud are sometimes on such a great scale that large towns, as in
the instance of the great city of Herculaneum, may be completely buried
beneath them. Over this city the mud accumulated to the depth of over 70
feet. In addition to these phenomena, molten lava often flows from the
lip of the crater, occasionally in vast quantities. In the Icelandic
eruption of 1783 the lava streams were so great in quantity as to fill
river gorges 600 ft. deep and 200 ft. wide, and to extend over an open
plain to a distance of 12 to 15 miles, forming lakes of lava 100 feet
deep. The volcanoes of Hawaii often send forth streams of lava which
cover an area of over 100 square miles to a great depth.


GREAT OUTFLOWS OF LAVA


In the course of ages lava outflows of this kind have built up in Hawaii
a volcanic mountain estimated to contain enough material to cover the
whole of the United States with a layer of rock 50 feet deep. These
great outflows of lava are not confined to mountains, but take place now
and then from openings in the ground, or from long cracks in the surface
rocks. Occasionally great eruptions have taken place beneath the
ocean's surface, throwing up material in sufficient quantity to form new
islands.

The formation of mud is not confined to the method given, but great
quantities of this plastic material flow at times from volcanic craters.
In the year 1691 Imbaburu, one of the peaks of the Andes, sent out
floods of mud which contained dead fish in such abundance that their
decay caused a fever in the vicinity. The volcanoes of Java have often
buried large tracts of fertile country under volcanic mud.

An observation of volcanoes shows us that they have three well marked
phases of action. The first of these is the state of permanent eruption,
as in case of the volcano of Stromboli in the Mediterranean. This state
is not a dangerous one, since the steam, escaping continually, acts as
a safety valve. The second stage is one of milder activity with an
occasional somewhat violent eruption; this is apt to be dangerous,
though not often very greatly so. The safety valve is partly out of
order. The third phase is one in which long periods of repose, sometimes
lasting for centuries, are followed by eruptions of intense energy.
These are often of extreme violence and cause widespread destruction. In
this case the safety valve has failed to work and the boiler bursts.


OFTEN REST FOR LONG TERMS OF YEARS


Such are the general features of action in the vast powers which
dwell deep beneath the surface, harmless in most parts of the earth,
frightfully perilous in others. Yet even here they often rest for long
terms of years in seeming apathy, until men gather above their lurking
places in multitudes, heedless or ignorant of the sleeping demons that
bide their time below. Their time is sure to come, after years, perhaps
after centuries. Suddenly the solid earth begins to tremble and quake;
roars as of one of the buried giants of old strike all men with dread;
then, with a fierce convulsion, a mountain is rent in twain and vast
torrents of steam, burning rock, and blinding dust are hurled far upward
into the air, to fall again and bury cities, perhaps, with all their
inhabitants in indiscriminate ruin and death.



CHAPTER XIX.

Theories of Volcanic and Earthquake Action.


Though the first formation of a volcano (Italian, vulcano, from Vulcan,
the Roman god of fire) has seldom been witnessed, it would seem that it
is marked by earthquake movements followed by the opening of a rent or
fissure; but with no such tilting up of the rocks as was once supposed
to take place. From this fissure large volumes of steam issue,
accompanied by hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrochloric
acid, and sulphur dioxide. The hydrogen, apparently derived from the
dissociation of water at a high temperature, flashes explosively into
union with atmospheric oxygen, and, having exerted its explosive force,
the steam condenses into cloud, heavy masses of which overhang the
volcano, pouring down copious rains. This naturally disturbs the
electrical condition of the atmosphere, so that thunder and lightning
are frequent accompaniments of an eruption. The hydrochloric acid
probably points to the agency of sea-water. Besides the gases just
mentioned, sulphuretted hydrogen, ammonia and common salt occur; but
mainly as secondary products, formed by the union of the vapors issuing
from the volcano, and commonly found also in the vapors rising from
cooling lava streams or dormant volcanic districts. It is important to
notice that the vapors issue from the volcano spasmodically, explosions
succeeding each other with great rapidity and noise.

All substances thrown out by the volcano, whether gaseous, liquid or
solid, are conveniently united under the term ejectamenta (Latin, things
thrown out), and all of them are in an intensely heated, if not an
incandescent state. Most of the gases are incombustible, but the
hydrogen and those containing sulphur burn with a true flame, perhaps
rendered more visible by the presence of solid particles. Much of the
so-called flame, however, in popular descriptions of eruptions is
an error of observation due to the red-hot solid particles and the
reflection of the glowing orifice on the over-hanging clouds.


ENORMOUS FORCE DISPLAYED


Solid bodies are thrown into the air with enormous force and to
proportionally great heights, those not projected vertically falling in
consequence at considerable distances from the volcano. A block weighing
200 tons is said to have been thrown nine miles by Cotopaxi; masses
of rock weighing as much as twenty tons to have been ejected by
Mount Ararat in 1840; and stones to have been hurled to a distance
of thirty-six miles in other cases. The solid matter thrown out by
volcanoes consists of lapilli, scoriae, dust and bombs.

Though on the first formation of the volcano, masses of non-volcanic
rock may be torn from the chimney or pipe of the mountain, only slightly
fused externally owing to the bad conducting power of most rocks,
and hurled to a distance; and though at the beginning of a subsequent
eruption the solid plug of rock which has cooled at the bottom of the
crater, or, in fact, any part of the volcano, may be similarly blown up,
the bulk of the solid particles of which the volcano itself is composed
is derived from the lake of lava or molten rock which seethes at the
orifice. Solid pieces rent from this fused mass and cast up by the
explosive force of the steam with which the lava is saturated are known
as lapilli. Cooling rapidly so as to be glassy in texture externally,
these often have time to become perfectly crystalline within.

Gases and steam escaping from other similar masses may leave them
hollow, when they are termed bombs, or may pit their surfaces with
irregular bubble-cavities, when they are called scoriae or scoriaceous.
Such masses whirling through the air in a plastic state often become
more or less oblately spheroidal in form; but, as often, the explosive
force of their contained vapors shatters them into fragments, producing
quantities of the finest volcanic dust or sand. This fine dust darkens
the clouds overhanging the mountain, mixes with the condensed steam to
fall as a black mud-rain, or lava di aqua (Italian, water lava), or
is carried up to enormous heights, and then slowly diffused by upper
currents of the atmosphere. In the eruption of Vesuvius of A.D. 79, the
air was dark as midnight for twelve or fifteen miles round; the city of
Pompeii was buried beneath a deposit of dry scoriae, or ashes and dust,
and Herculaneum beneath a layer of the mud-like lava di aqua, which on
drying sets into a compact rock. Rocks formed from these fragmentary
volcanic materials are known as tuff.


VOLCANIC CONES HAVE SIMILAR CURVATURES


It is entirely of these cindery fragments heaped up with marvellous
rapidity round the orifice that the volcano itself is first formed. It
may, as in the case of Jorullo in Mexico in 1759, form a cone several
hundred feet high in less than a day. Such a cone may have a slope as
steep as 30 or 40 degrees, its incline in all cases depending simply on
the angle of repose of its materials; the inclination, that is, at which
they stop rolling. The great volcanoes of the Andes, which are formed
mainly of ash, are very steep. Owing to a general similarity in their
materials, volcanic cones in all parts of the world have very similar
curvatures; but older volcanic mountains, in which lava-streams have
broken through the cone, secondary cones have arisen, or portions
have been blown up, are more irregular in outline and more gradual in
inclination.

In size, volcanoes vary from mere mounds a few yards in diameter, such
as the salses or mud volcanoes near the Caspian, to Etna, 10,800 feet
high, with a base 30 miles in diameter; Cotopaxi, in the Andes, 18,887
feet high; or Mauna Loa, in the Sandwich Isles, 13,700 feet high; with
a base 70 miles in diameter, and two craters, one of which, Kilauea, the
largest active crater on our earth, is seven miles in circuit. Larger
extinct craters occur in Japan; but all our terrestrial volcanic
mountains are dwarfed by those observed on the surface of the moon,
which, owing to its smaller size, has cooled more rapidly than our
earth. It is, of course, the explosive force from below which keeps
