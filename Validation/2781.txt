risking destruction if he pushed on. He therefore turned and marched
back to the city. Had he continued his way Peterborough's force must
have been destroyed, as Stanhope had not yet come up, and he had with
him only the little force with which he had marched out from camp, of
whom more than a fourth were already captured or slain. Such are the
circumstances upon which the fate of battles and campaigns depend.



CHAPTER VIII: A TUMULT IN THE CITY


As the Spanish column retired to Barcelona under the idea that the
whole English army was on the hill, the Miquelets, as the armed bands
of peasants were called, swarmed down from the hills. Incapable of
withstanding an attack by even a small force, they were in their element
in harassing a large one in retreat. Halfway between Montjuich and the
town was the small fort of San Bertram. The garrison, seeing the column
in retreat toward the town, pursued by the insurgent peasantry, feared
that they themselves would be cut off, and so abandoned their post and
joined the retreat.

The peasants at once took possession of San Bertram, where there were
five light guns. As soon as the news reached Peterborough he called
together two hundred men and led them down to the little fort. Ropes
were fastened to the guns, and with forty men to each gun these were
quickly run up the hill and placed in position in the captured bastions.
So quickly was this done that in less than an hour from the abandonment
of San Bertram by the Spanish the guns had opened fire upon Montjuich.

While the troops worked these five guns and the three captured in
Southwell's first attack Jack Stilwell was sent off on horseback at full
speed with an order for the landing of the heavy guns and mortars from
the fleet. The news of the attack on Montjuich and the retreat of the
Spanish column spread with rapidity through the country, and swarms of
armed peasants flocked in. These the earl dispersed among the ravines
and groves round the city, so as to prevent any parties from coining
out to ascertain what was going on round Montjuich, and to mask the
movements of the besiegers.

Velasco appeared paralyzed by the energy and daring of his opponent,
and although he had in hand a force equal if not superior to that which
Peterborough could dispose of, he allowed two days to pass without
attempting to relieve Montjuich. In those two days wonders had been
performed by the soldiers and sailors, who toiled unweariedly in
dragging the heavy guns from the landing place to the hill of Montjuich.
The light cannon of the besiegers had had but little effect upon the
massive walls of the fortress, and the Prince Caraccioli held out for
two days even against the heavier metal of the mortars and siege guns
that were quickly brought to bear upon him.

On the 17th, however, Colonel Southwell by a well aimed shot brought
the siege to a close. He noticed that a small chapel within the fort
appeared to be specially guarded by the besieged, and ordered a Dutch
sergeant of artillery, who was working a heavy mortar, to try to drop
a shell upon it. The artilleryman made several attempts, but each time
missed the mark. Colonel Southwell undertook the management of the
mortar himself, and soon succeeded in dropping a shell upon the roof
of the building, which proved, as he had suspected, to be in use as a
magazine. There was a tremendous explosion, the chapel was shattered
into fragments, Caraccioli and three other officers were killed, and a
great breach was blown in the main rampart.

A loud cheer broke from the besiegers, and Colonel Southwell at once put
himself at the head of the men in the trenches and advanced to storm
the breach before the enemy could recover from their confusion. The
disastrous effects of the explosion had, however, scared all idea of
further resistance out of the minds of the defenders, who at once
rushed out of the works and called out that they surrendered, the senior
surviving officer and his companions delivering up their swords to
Colonel Southwell, and begging that protection might at once be given to
their soldiers from the Miquelets, whose ferocity was as notorious then
as it was a hundred years afterward.

Peterborough appointed Colonel Southwell governor of Montjuich, and
at once turned his attention to the city. The brilliant result of the
attack on the citadel had silenced all murmurs and completely restored
Lord Peterborough's authority. Soldiers and sailors vied with each other
in their exertions to get the guns into position, and the Miquelets,
largely increased in number, became for once orderly and active, and
labored steadily in the trenches.

The main army conducted the attack from the side at which it had been
originally commenced, while General Stanhope, his force considerably
increased by troops from the main body, conducted the attack from the
side of Montjuich. Four batteries of heavy guns and two of mortars soon
opened fire upon the city, while the smaller vessels of the fleet moved
close in to the shore and threw shot and shell into the town.

A breach was soon effected in the rampart, and Velasco was summoned to
surrender; but he refused to do so, although his position had become
almost desperate. The disaffection of the inhabitants was now openly
shown. The soldiers had lost confidence and heart, and the loyalty of
many of them was more than doubtful. The governor arrested many of the
mutinous soldiers and hostile citizens, and turned numbers of them out
of the city.

On the 3d of October the English engineers declared the breach on the
side of Montjuich to be practicable, and Peterborough himself wrote to
the governor offering honorable terms of capitulation, but declaring
that if these were rejected he would not renew his offer.

Velasco again refused. He had erected a formidable intrenchment within
the breach, and had sunk two mines beneath the ruins in readiness to
blow the assailing columns into the air.

The guns again opened fire, and in a very short time a Dutch artillery
officer threw two shells upon the intrenchment and almost destroyed
it, while a third fell on the breach itself, and crashing through the
rubbish fired Velasco's two mines and greatly enlarged the breach. The
earl could now have carried the town by storm had he chosen, but with
his usual magnanimity to the vanquished he again wrote to Velasco and
summoned him to surrender.

The governor had now no hope of a successful resistance, and he
therefore agreed to surrender in four days should no relief arrive. The
terms agreed upon were that the garrison should march out with all
the honors of war, and should be transported by sea to San Felix, and
escorted thence to Gerona; but as a few hours later the news arrived
that Gerona had declared for King Charles, Velasco requested to be
conveyed to Rosas instead. The capitulation was signed on the 9th of
October, and the garrison were preparing to march out on the 14th, when,
in the English camp, the sound of a tumult in the city was heard.

"Quick, Stilwell!" the earl cried, running out of his tent, "to horse!
The rascals inside are breaking out into a riot, and there will be a
massacre unless I can put a stop to it."

The earl leaped on to his horse, called to a few orderly dragoons
who were at hand to accompany him, and ordered that four companies of
grenadiers should follow as quickly as possible.

Galloping at full speed Peterborough soon arrived at the gate of San
Angelo, and ordered the Spanish guard to open it. This they did without
hesitation, and followed by his little party he rode into the city. All
was uproar and confusion. The repressive measures which the governor had
been obliged to take against the disaffected had added to the Catalan
hatred of the French, and the Austrian party determined to have
vengeance upon the governor. A report was circulated that he intended
to carry away with him a number of the principal inhabitants in spite
of the articles of capitulation. This at once stirred up the people to
fury, and they assailed and plundered the houses of the French and of
the known partisans of the Duke d'Anjou.

They then turned upon the governor and garrison. The latter dispersed
through the city, and, unprepared for attack, would speedily have
been massacred had not their late enemy been at hand to save them.
Peterborough, with his little party of dragoons, rode through the
streets exhorting, entreating, and commanding the rioters to abstain.
When, as in some cases, the mob refused to listen to him, and continued
their work, the dragoons belabored them heartily with the flats of their
swords; and the surprise caused by seeing the British uniforms in their
midst, and their ignorance of how many of the British had entered, did
more even than the efforts of the dragoons to allay the tumult. Many
ladies of quality had taken refuge in the convent, and Peterborough at
once placed a guard over this.

Dashing from street to street, unattended even by his dragoons,
Peterborough came upon a lady and gentleman struggling with the mob, who
were about to ill treat them. He charged into the thick of the tumult.

His hat had been lost in the fray, and the mob, not recognizing the
strange figure as the redoubted English general, resisted, and one
discharged a musket at him at a distance of a few feet, but the ball
passed through his periwig without touching the head under it.

Fortunately two or three of his dragoons now rode up, and he was able
to carry the lady and gentleman to their house hard by, when, to his
satisfaction, he found that the gentleman he had saved was the Duke of
Popoli, and the lady his wife, celebrated as one of the most beautiful
women in Europe.

Jack Stilwell had soon after they entered the town become separated from
his general. Seeing a mob gathered before a house in a side street, and
hearing screams, he turned off and rode into the middle of the crowd.
Spurring his horse and making him rear, he made his way through them to
the door, and then leaping off, drawing as he did so a pistol from his
holster, he ran upstairs.

It was a large and handsomely furnished house. On the first floor was a
great corridor. A number of men were gathered round a doorway. Within he
heard the clashing of steel and the shouts of men in conflict. Bursting
his way in through the doorway he entered the room.

In a corner, at the furthest end, crouched a lady holding a little boy
in her arms. Before her stood a Spanish gentleman, sword in hand. A
servant, also armed, stood by him. They were hard pressed, for six or
eight men with swords and pikes were cutting and thrusting at them.
Three servants lay dead upon the ground, and seven or eight of the
townspeople were also lying dead or wounded. Jack rushed forward,
and with his pistol shot the man who appeared to be the leader of the
assailants, and then, drawing his sword, placed himself before the
gentleman and shouted to the men to lay down their arms. The latter,
astounded at the appearance of an English officer, drew back. Seeing he
was alone, they would, however, have renewed the attack, but Jack ran to
the window and opened it, and shouted as if to some soldiers below.

The effect was instantaneous. The men dropped upon their knees, and
throwing down their arms begged for mercy. Jack signified that he
granted it, and motioned to them to carry off their dead and wounded
comrades. Some of the men in the corridor came in to aid them in so
doing. Jack, sword in hand, accompanied them to the door, and saw them
out of the house. Then he told a boy to hold his horse, and closing
the door returned upstairs. He found the gentleman sitting on a chair
exhausted, while his wife, crying partly from relief, partly from
anxiety, was endeavoring to stanch the blood which flowed from several
wounds.

Jack at once aided her in the task, and signed to the servant to bring
something to drink. The man ran to a buffet and produced some cordials.
Jack filled a glass and placed it at the lips of the wounded man, who,
after drinking it, gradually recovered his strength.

"My name, sir," he said, "is Count Julian de Minas, and I owe you my
life and that of my wife and child. To whom am I indebted so much?"

Jack did not, of course, understand his words, but the title caught his
ear, and he guessed that the Spaniard was introducing himself.

"My name is Stilwell," Jack said; "I am one of General Peterborough's
aides de camp. I am very glad to be of assistance; and now, seeing you
are so far recovered, I must leave you, for there is much to do in the
town, and the general has entered with only a few troops. I think you
need not fear any return on the part of these ruffians. The English
troops will enter the town in the coarse of a few hours."

So saying Jack immediately hurried away, and mounting his horse rode off
to find the general.

The news that Lord Peterborough and the English had entered spread
rapidly through the city, and the rioters, fearing to excite the wrath
of the man who in a few hours would be master of the town, scattered to
their homes, and when all was quiet Peterborough again rode off to the
camp with his troops and there waited quietly until the hour appointed
for the capitulation. The Spanish then marched out, and the earl entered
with a portion of his troops.

He at once issued a proclamation that if any person had any lawful
grievances against the late governor they should go to the town house
and lay them in proper form, and that he would see that justice was
done. An hour later some of the principal inhabitants waited upon him,
and asked which churches he desired to have for the exercise of his
religion. He replied:

"Wherever I have my quarters I shall have conveniency enough to worship
God, and as for the army they will strictly follow the rules of war, and
perform divine service among themselves without giving any offense to
any one."

This answer gave great satisfaction to the people, as the French had
spread a report among them that the Protestants, if they captured the
town, would take their churches from them.

In the evening the earl gave a great banquet, at which he entertained
all the people of distinction of both parties, and his courtesy and
affability at once won for him the confidence of all with whom he came
in contact. The next day the shops were all opened, the markets filled,
and there were no signs that the tranquillity of Barcelona had ever
been disturbed. Soon after breakfast Jack, who was quartered in the
governor's palace with the general, was informed that a gentleman wished
to speak to him, and the Count de Minas was shown in. He took Jack's
hand and bowed profoundly. As conversation was impossible Jack told his
orderly to fetch one of the interpreters attached to the general.

"I tried to come last night," the count said, "but I found that I was
too weak to venture out. I could not understand what you said when you
went away so suddenly, but I guessed that it was the call of duty. I
did not know your name, but inquiring this morning who were the officers
that entered with the general yesterday, I was told that his aide de
camp, Lieutenant Stilwell, was alone with him. That is how I found
you. And now, let me again thank you for the immense service you have
rendered me and my wife and child. Remember, henceforth the life of the
Count de Minas and all that he possesses is at your service."

When the interpreter had translated this, Jack said in some confusion,
"I am very glad, count, to have been of service to you. It was a piece
of good fortune, indeed, on my part that I happened so providentially
to ride along at the right moment. I was about this morning to do myself
the honor of calling to inquire how the countess and yourself were after
the terrible scene of yesterday."

"The countess prayed me to bring you round to her," the count said.
"Will you do me the honor of accompanying me now?"

Jack at once assented, and, followed by the interpreter, proceeded with
the count to his house. The room into which the count led him was not
that in which the fray had taken place the day before. The countess rose
as they entered, and Jack saw that, though still pale and shaken by the
events of the previous day, she was a singularly beautiful woman.

"Ah, senor," she said, advancing to meet him, and taking his hand and
laying it against her heart, "how can I thank you for the lives of my
husband and my boy! One more minute and you would have arrived too late.
It seemed to me as if heaven had opened and an angel had come to our aid
when you entered."

Jack colored up hotly as the interpreter translated the words. If he had
expressed his thoughts he would have said, "Please don't make any more
fuss about it;" but he found that Spanish courtesy required much more
than this, so he answered:

"Countess, the moment was equally fortunate to me, and I shall ever feel
grateful that I have been permitted to be of service to so beautiful a
lady."

The countess smiled as Jack's words were translated.

"I did not know that you English were flatterers," she said. "They told
us that you were uncouth islanders, but I see that they have calumniated
