The Project Gutenberg Etext This Country Of Ours, by H. E. Marshall
*******This file should be named 3761.txt or 3761.zip*******

Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless
a copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep
any of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at: http://gutenberg.net
http://promo.net/pg


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement can
surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is also
a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the indexes
our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an announcement
goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.


or ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want, as
it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etexts, is a "public domain"
work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart through the Project
Gutenberg Association (the "Project").  Among other things, this

to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain works.  Despite
these efforts, the Project's etexts and any medium they may be on may
contain "Defects".  Among other things, Defects may take the form
of incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a
copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective

Chapter 1 - How the Vikings of Old Sought and Found New Lands




In days long long ago there dwelt in Greenland a King named Eric the
Red.  He was a man mighty in war, and men held him in high honour.

Now one day to the court of Eric there came Bjarni the son of
Heriulf.  This Bjarni was a far traveler.  He had sailed many times
upon the seas, and when he came home he had ever some fresh tale
of marvel and adventure to tell.  But this time he had a tale to
tell more marvelous than any before.  For he told how far away across
the sea of Greenland, where no man had sailed before, he had found
a new, strange land.

But when the people asked news of this unknown land Bjarni could
tell them little, for he had not set foot upon those far shores.
Therefore the people scorned him.

"Truly you have little hardihood," they said, "else you had gone
ashore, and seen for yourself, and had given us good account of
this land."

But although Bjarni could tell nought of the new strange land, save
that he had seen it, the people thought much about it, and there
was great talk about voyages and discoveries, and many longed to
sail forth and find again the land which Bjarni the Traveler had
seen.  But more than any other in that kingdom, Leif the son of Eric
the Red, longed to find that land.  So Leif went to Eric and said:

"Oh my father, I fain would seek the land which Bjarni the Traveler
has seen.  Give me gold that I may buy his ship and sail away upon
the seas to find it."

Then Eric the Red gave his son gold in great plenty. "Go, my son,"
he said, "buy the ship of Bjarni the Traveler, and sail to the land
of which he tells."

Then Leif, quickly taking the gold, went to Bjarni and bought his
ship.

Leif was a tall man, of great strength and noble bearing.  He was
also a man of wisdom, and just in all things, so that men loved
and were ready to obey him.

Now therefore many men came to him offering to be his companions
in adventure, until soon they were a company of thirty-five men.
They were all men tall and of great strength, with fair golden hair
and eyes blue as the sea upon which they loved to sail, save only
Tyrker the German.

Long time this German had lived with Eric the Red and was much
beloved by him.  Tyrker also loved Leif dearly, for he had known
him since he was a child, and was indeed his foster father.  So he
was eager to go with Leif upon this adventurous voyage.  Tyrker was
very little and plain.  His forehead was high and his eyes small and
restless.  He wore shabby clothes, and to the blue-eyed, fair-haired
giants of the North he seemed indeed a sorry-looking little fellow.
But all that mattered little, for he was a clever craftsman, and
Leif and his companions were glad to have him go with them.

Then, all things being ready, Leif went to his father and, bending
his knee to him, prayed him to be their leader.

But Eric the Red shook his head. "Nay, my son," he said, " I am old
and stricken in years, and no more able to endure the hardships of
the sea."

"Yet come, my father," pleaded Leif, "for of a certainty if you
do, good luck will go with us."

Then Eric looked longingly at the sea.  His heart bade him go out
upon it once again ere he died.  So he yielded to the prayers of
his son and, mounting upon his horse, he rode towards the ship.

When the sea-farers saw him come they set up a shout of welcome.
But when Eric was not far from the ship the horse upon which he
was riding stumbled, and he was thrown to the ground.  He tried to
rise but could not, for his foot was sorely wounded.

Seeing that he cried out sadly, "It is not for me to discover new
lands; go ye without me."

So Eric the Red returned to his home, and Leif went on his way to
his ship with his companions.

Now they busied themselves and set their dragon-headed vessel
in order.  And when all was ready they spread their gaily-coloured
sails, and sailed out into the unknown sea.

Westward and ever westward they sailed towards the setting of the
sun.  For many days they sailed yet they saw no land: nought was
about them but the restless, tossing waves.  But at length one day
to their watching eyes there appeared a faint grey line far on the
horizon.  Then their hearts bounded for joy.  They had not sailed in
vain, for land was near.

"Surely," said Leif, as they drew close to it, "this is the land
which Bjarni saw.  Let it not be said of us that we passed it by as
he did."

So, casting anchor, Leif and his companions launched a boat and
went ashore.  But it was no fair land to which they had come.  Far
inland great snow-covered mountains rose, and between them and the
sea lay flat and barren rock, where no grass or green thing grew.
It seemed to Leif and his companions that there was no good thing
in this land.

"I will call it Helluland or Stone Land," said Leif.

Then he and his companions went back to the ship and put out to
sea once more.  They came to land again after some time, and again
they cast anchor and launched a boat and went ashore.  This land
was flat.  Broad stretches of white sand sloped gently to the sea,
and behind the level plain was thickly wooded.

"This land," said Leif, "shall also have a name after its nature."
So he called it Markland or Woodland.

Then again Leif and his companions returned to the ship, and mounting
into it they sailed away upon the sea.  And now fierce winds arose,
and the ship was driven before the blast so that for days these
seafarers thought no more of finding new lands, but only of the
safety of their ship.

But at length the wind fell, and the sun shone forth once more.  Then
again they saw land, and launching their boat they rowed ashore.

To the eyes of these sea-faring men, who for many days had seen
only the wild waste of waters, the land seemed passing fair.  For
the grass was green, and as the sun shone upon it seemed to sparkle
with a thousand diamonds.  When the men put their hands upon the
grass, and touched their mouths with their hands, and drank the
dew, it seemed to them that never before had they tasted anything
so sweet.  So pleasant the land seemed to Leif and his companions
that they determined to pass the winter there.  They therefore drew
their ship up the river which flowed into the sea, and cast anchor.

Then they carried their hammocks ashore and set to work to build
a house

When the house was finished Leif called his companions together
and spoke to them.

"I will now divide our company into two bands," he said, "so that
we may explore the country round about.  One half shall stay at
home, and the other half shall explore the land.  But they who go
to explore must not go so far away that they cannot return home at
night, nor must they separate from each other, lest they be lost."

And as Leif said so it was done.  Each day a company set out
to explore, and sometimes Leif went with the exploring party, and
sometimes he stayed at home.  But each day as evening came they all
returned to their house, and told what they had seen.

At length, however, one day, when those who had gone abroad returned,
one of their number was missing, and when the roll was called it
was found that it was Tyrker the German who had strayed.  Thereat
Leif was sorely troubled, for he loved his foster-father dearly.  So
he spoke sternly to his men, reproaching them for their carelessness
in letting Tyrker separate from them, and taking twelve of his men
with him he set out at once to search for his foster-father.  But
they had not gone far when, to their great joy, they saw their lost
comrade coming towards them.

"Why art thou so late, oh my foster-father?" cried Leif, as he ran
to him.  "Why hast thou gone astray from the others?"

But Tyrker paid little heed to Leif's questions.  He was strangely
excited, and rolling his eyes wildly he laughed and spoke in German
