PREFATORY NOTE.


I cannot permit this Edition of "The Ancient Church" to appear before
the citizens of the United States without acknowledging my obligations
to Mr Charles Scribner of New York. Mr Scribner was the first gentleman
connected with the noble profession to which he belongs, either in the
Old or in the New World, from whom I received encouragement in this
undertaking; and his prompt and generous offers aided me materially in
making arrangements for the publication of the work in Great Britain.
Every line of the present impression has been corrected by myself, and
should my life be spared, any future Edition which Mr Scribner may
publish is to appear under the same supervision. I trust that the Trade
throughout the Union will recognize the debt of gratitude which I owe to
my American friend. There is a higher law than the law of international
copyright, and I feel confident that no Publisher of honour and
integrity in the Great Republic will repudiate its claims.

PREFACE.


The appearance of another history of the early Church requires some
explanation. As the progress of the Christian commonwealth for the first
three hundred years has been recently described by British, German, and
American writers of eminent ability, it may, perhaps, be thought that
the subject is now exhausted. No competent judge will pronounce such an
opinion. During the last quarter of a century, various questions
relating to the ancient Church, which are almost, if not altogether,
ignored in existing histories, have been earnestly discussed; whilst
several documents, lately discovered, have thrown fresh light on its
transactions. There are, besides, points of view, disclosing unexplored
fields for thought, from which the ecclesiastical landscape has never
yet been contemplated. The following work is an attempt to exhibit some
of its features as seen from a new position.

The importance of this portion of the history of the Church can scarcely
be over-estimated. Our attention is here directed to the life of Christ,
to the labours of the apostles and evangelists, to the doctrines which
they taught, to the form of worship which they sanctioned, to the
organization of the community which they founded, and to the indomitable
constancy with which its members suffered persecution. The practical
bearing of the topics thus brought under review must be sufficiently
obvious.

In the interval between the days of the apostles and the conversion of
Constantine, the Christian commonwealth changed its aspect. The Bishop
of Rome--a personage unknown to the writers of the New Testament--
meanwhile rose into prominence, and at length took precedence of
all other churchmen. Rites and ceremonies, of which neither Paul nor
Peter ever heard, crept silently into use, and then claimed the rank of
divine institutions. Officers, for whom the primitive disciples could
have found no place, and titles, which to them would have been
altogether unintelligible, began to challenge attention, and to be named
apostolic. It is the duty of the historian to endeavour to point out the
origin, and to trace the progress of these innovations. A satisfactory
account of them must go far to settle more than one of our present
controversies. An attempt is here made to lay bare the causes which
produced these changes, and to mark the stages of the ecclesiastical
revolution. When treating of the rise and growth of the hierarchy,
several remarkable facts and testimonies which have escaped the notice
of preceding historians are particularly noticed.

Some may, perhaps, consider that, in a work such as this, undue
prominence has been given to the discussion of the question of the
Ignatian epistles. Those who have carefully examined the subject will
scarcely think so. If we accredit these documents, the history of the
early Church is thrown into a state of hopeless confusion; and men,
taught and honoured by the apostles themselves, must have inculcated the
most dangerous errors. But if their claims vanish, when touched by the
wand of truthful criticism, many clouds which have hitherto darkened the
ecclesiastical atmosphere disappear; and the progress of corruption can
be traced on scientific principles. The special attention of all
interested in the Ignatian controversy is invited to the two chapters of
this work in which the subject is investigated. Evidence is there
produced to prove that these Ignatian letters, even as edited by the
very learned and laborious Doctor Cureton, are utterly spurious, and
that they should be swept away from among the genuine remains of early
Church literature with the besom of scorn.

Throughout the work very decided views are expressed on a variety of
topics; but it must surely be unnecessary to tender an apology for the
free utterance of these sentiments; for, when recording the progress of
a revolution affecting the highest interests of man, the narrator cannot
be expected to divest himself of his cherished convictions; and very few
will venture to maintain that a writer, who feels no personal interest
in the great principles brought to light by the gospel, is, on that
account, more competent to describe the faith, the struggles, and the
triumphs of the primitive Christians. I am not aware that mere prejudice
has ever been permitted to influence my narrative, or that any statement
has been made which does not rest upon solid evidence. Some of the views
here presented may not have been suggested by any previous investigator,
and they may be exceedingly damaging to certain popular theories; but
they should not, therefore, be summarily condemned. Surely every honest
effort to explain and reconcile the memorials of antiquity is entitled
to a candid criticism. Nor, from those whose opinion is really worthy of
respect, do I despair of a kindly reception for this volume. One of the
most hopeful signs of the times is the increasing charity of evangelical
Christians. There is a growing disposition to discountenance the spirit
of religious partisanship, and to bow to the supremacy of TRUTH. I trust
that those who are in quest of the old paths trodden by the apostles and
the martyrs will find some light to guide them in the following pages.

Polity of the Christian Church borrowed from the institutions of

No higher and lower houses  of convocation  in  the apostolic Church,  ib.

The unity of the apostolic Church--in what it consisted, to
    what it may be compared,                                           262

    but individuals,                                                   265
The name angel probably not taken from that of an officer of the
    synagogue,                                                         ib.

The angels of the Churches not diocesan bishops,                       267
The stars, not attached to the candlesticks, but in the hand of
    Christ,                                                            268
The angels of the Churches were their messengers sent to visit
    John in Patmos,                                                    ib.
Why only seven angels named,                                           271
