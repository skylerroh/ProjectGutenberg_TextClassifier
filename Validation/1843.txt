with the freedom that we have, but must needs set on the chance of a die
whether we shall be masters or servants, let us devise some way by which
the one may win dominion over the other without great loss and shedding
of blood." Now King Tullus was a great warrior, and would willingly
have fought, being confident that he and his people would prevail;
nevertheless the thing that Mettus of Alba had said pleased him. And
when they came to consider the matter, there seemed by good fortune
to be a way ready to their hands. There were in the army of Alba three
brothers that had been born at one birth, whose name was Curiatius.
And in the army of the Romans there were other three, and these born
likewise at one birth, whose name was Horatius. Nor was there much
difference in respect either of age or of strength between the brothers
of Alba and the brothers of Rome. Then King Tullus and Mettus of Alba
called for the brothers, and enquired of them whether they were willing
to fight, each three for their own country, agreement being first
made that that people should bear rule for ever whose champions should
prevail in the battle. And as the young men were willing, a place was
appointed for the battle and a time also. But first there was made a
treaty in this fashion, for the fashion of making treaties is the same
always, though their conditions be different. The herald said, "Wilt
thou, King Tullus, that I make a treaty with the minister of the people
of Alba?" And when the King answered "Yea," the herald said, "I will
that thou give me the sacred herbs." Then the King made reply, "Take
them, and see that they be clean." So the herald took them clean from
the hill of the citadel. Having done this, he said to the King, "Dost
thou appoint me to do the pleasure of the people of Rome, me and my
implements and my attendants with me?" And the King answered, "So that
it be without damage to the people of Rome." Then the herald appointed
one Spurius to be minister that he should take the oath, and touched his
hair with the sacred herbs. And when Spurius had taken the oath, and the
conditions of the treaty had been read aloud, he spake, saying, "Hear
thou, Jupiter, and thou also, minister of the people of Alba, and ye men
of Alba; as these conditions have been duly read aloud this day from
the beginning even to the end from these tables, and after the
interpretation by which they may be the most easily understood, even
so shall the Roman people abide by them. And if this people, acting by
common consent, shall falsely depart from them, then do thou, O Jupiter,
smite the Roman people, even as I shall smite this swine to-day. And
smite them by so much the more strongly as thou art stronger than I."
And when he had said this he smote the swine with a knife of stone.
The men of Alba also took the oath, and confirmed it after their own
fashion. These things having been thus ordered, the champions made them
ready for battle. And first their fellows exhorted them severally in
many words, saying that the gods of their country, their countrymen
also and kinsfolk, whether they tarried at home or stood in the field,
regarded their arms that day; and afterwards they went forth into the
space that lay between the two armies. And these sat and watched them
before their camps, being quit indeed of the peril of battle, but full
of care how the matter should end, seeing that so great things, even
sovereignty and freedom, should be decided by the valour and good luck
of so few men. Then, the signal of battle being given, the three met the
three with such courage and fierceness as though there were a whole army
on either side. And as their swords rang against each other and flashed,
all men trembled to see, and could scarcely speak or breathe for fear
of what should happen. And for a while, in so narrow a space did the men
fight, nought could be seen but how they swayed to and fro, and how the
blood ran down upon the ground. But afterwards it was plain to see that
of the three Romans two were fallen dead upon the ground, and that of
the three champions of Alba each man was wounded.

[Illustration: Death of the Horatti and Curiattii 056]

At this sight the Alban host shouted for joy, but the men of Rome had
no more any hope but only fear, to think what should befall their one
champion that had now three enemies against him. Now, by good luck, it
had so fallen out that this one had received no wound, so that, though
he was no match for the three together, he did not doubt but that he
should prevail over them severally one by one. Wherefore, that he might
so meet them, dividing them the one from the other, he made a feint to
fly, thinking that they would follow him each as quickly as his wound
might suffer him. And so it fell out. For when he had fled now no
small space from the ground where they had fought at the first, he
saw, looking behind him, that the three were following him at a great
distance one from the other, and that one was very near to himself. Then
he turned himself and ran fiercely upon the man; and behold even while
the men of Alba cried aloud to the two that they should help their
brother, he had slain him, and was now running towards the second. And
when the men of Rome saw what had befallen, they set up a great shout,
as men are wont when they have good luck beyond their hopes; and their
champion made such haste to do his part that or ever the third of the
Alban three could come up, though indeed he was close at hand, he had
slain the second also. And now, seeing that there remained one only on
either side, there was in some sort an equality, yet were the two
not equal either in hope or in strength. For the champion of Rome had
suffered no wound, and having overcome his foes now once and again
was full of courage; but the champion of Alba being now spent with his
wound, and wearied also with running, was as it were vanquished already.
Nor indeed was there a battle between the two; for the Roman cried, "One
and another of my foes have I offered to the spirits of my brothers; but
this third will I offer to the cause for which we have fought this day,
even that Rome may have the dominion over Alba." And when the champion
of Alba could now scarce bear up his shield, he stood over and ran his
sword downwards into his throat Afterwards, as the man lay dead upon
the ground, he spoiled him of his arms. Then did the men of Rome receive
their champion with much rejoicing, having all the more gladness because
they had been in so great fear. Afterwards each host set themselves to
bury their dead, whose tombs remain to this day, each in the spot where
he fell, for the two Romans are buried in one sepulchre nearer to
Alba, and the three champions of Alba as you go towards Rome, but with
somewhat of space between them, even as they fought.

Before the armies departed to their homes, Mettus of Alba inquired of
Tullus what he would have him to do according to treaty. And the King
answered, "Keep the young men under arms. I shall call for them if I
have war against the men of Veii."

And now the men of Rome went back to the city, and Horatius went before
them, carrying the spoils of the three whom he had slain. But at the
Capene gate there met him his sister, who was betrothed to one of the
champions of Alba; and when the maiden saw upon his shoulders the cloak
of her betrothed (and indeed she had wrought it with her own hands) she
tore her hair and cried to the dead man by name with a lamentable voice.
But Horatius was wroth to hear the words of mourning on the day when
he had won so great a victory and the people rejoiced; and he drew his
sword and slew the maiden, crying, "Depart hence to thy lover with
the love that thou cherishest out of season; thou that forgettest thy
brethren that are dead, and thy brother that is yet alive, and thine own
people also. So perish whosoever shall make lamentations for an enemy
of Rome." And when the Fathers and the Commons saw what was done, they
thought it a wicked deed, but remembered what great service the man had
newly rendered to Rome. Nevertheless they laid hands on him and took him
to the King that he should judge him. But the King being loath to judge
such a matter, or to give sentence against the man, said, "I appoint
two men as the law commands, who shall judge Horatius for murder." Now
the law was this: "If a man do murder, two men shall judge him; if he
appeal against the two, let the appeal be tried; if their sentence be
confirmed, ye shall cover his head and scourge him within the walls
or without the walls, and hang him by a rope upon the gallows." Then
there were appointed two men according to the law, who affirmed that they
could not let the man go free, whether his guilt was small or great,
seeing that he had manifestly done the deed. Therefore said one of them,
"Publius Horatius, we adjudge thee to be guilty of murder. Go, lictor,
bind his hands." But when the lictor came and was now ready to cast the
rope about him, Horatius cried, "I appeal to the people;" for the King
himself, being mercifully disposed to him, bade him do so. Then was
there a trial before the people, in which that which most wrought upon
the hearts of men was that the father of Horatius constantly affirmed
that his daughter had been rightly slain. "Nay," said he, "verily, if
the young man had not slain her, I had used against him my right as a
father, and had condemned him to die."

Then again he besought them that they should not leave him desolate and
bereaved of his children, he who but the day before had had so fair a
stock. Afterwards, throwing his arms about the young man, he stretched
out his hands to the spoils of the Curiatii, crying, "Will ye endure,
men of Rome, to see him bound under the gallows and beaten with stripes
whom ye beheld but yesterday adorned with these spoils and rejoicing in
his victory? Not so. Surely the men of Alba themselves had not borne to
see such a sight. Go, lictor, bind his hands, though but yesterday they
won so great a dominion for the people of Rome. Go, cover the head of
him that made this people free; hang him upon the accursed tree; scourge
him, whether within the walls, so that thou do it among the spoils
of them that he slew, or without the walls, so that it be near to the
sepulchres of the champions of Alba. Whither can ye take this youth
that the memorials of his valour shall not save him from so foul a
punishment?" And when the people saw the tears of the old man, and
bethought them also what great courage the youth had shown in danger,
they could not endure to condemn him; but regarding his valour rather
than the goodness of his cause, let him go free. Only, because the deed
had been so manifest, a command was laid upon the father that he should
make a trespass offering for his son at the public charge. Then the
father, having made certain sacrifices of expiation--which are performed
to this day in the house of Horatius--set up a beam across the way and
covered his son's head, and led him beneath it. As for the maiden, they
built her tomb of hewn stone in the place where she was slain.

Now the men of Alba were wroth to think that the fortunes of the whole
people had been thus trusted to the hands of three soldiers; and Mettus,
being of an unstable mind, was led away to evil in his desire to do
them a pleasure. And as before he had sought for peace when others were
desirous of war, so now he desired war when others were minded to be at
peace. But because he knew that the men of Alba were not able of their
own strength to do that which they desired, he stirred up certain others
of the nations round about, that they should make war openly against
Rome. As for himself and his people, he purposed that they should seem
indeed to be friends and allies, but should be ready for treachery when
occasion served. Thereupon the men of Fidenae, being colonists from Rome,
and the men of Veii promised that they would make war, and Mettus on
his part promised that he would come over to them with his army in
the battle. First the men of Fidenae rebelled, and King Tullus marched
against them, bidding Mettus come also with his army, and having crossed
the river Anio, pitched his camp where Anio flows into Tiber. And by
this time the men of Veii also had come up with their army, and these
were on the right wing next to the river, and the men of Fidenae on the
left, next to the mountains. The ordering of King Tullus was that he and
his men should do battle with the men of Veii, and Mettus and the Albans
with the men of Fidenae. Now Mettus, as he was not minded to do right, so
had no courage to do wrong boldly; and because he dared not to go over
to the enemy, led his men away slowly towards the mountains. Being come
thither, he set out his men in battle array, being minded to join them
whom he should perceive to prevail. At first the Romans marvelled that
Mettus and his men should so depart from them; and after a while they
sent a messenger to the King, saying, "The men of Alba have left us."
Then the King knew in his heart that there was treachery, and he vowed
that he would build temples to Paleness and Panic, if he should win the
victory that day. Nevertheless he showed no sign of fear, but cried to
the horsemen with a loud voice, that the enemy might hear, saying, "Go
thou back to the battle, and bid thy comrades be of good courage. Mettus
does my bidding that he may take the men of Fidenae in the rear." Also
he bade the cavalry raise their spears in the air, that so the Romans
might, for the most part, be hindered from seeing that the men of Alba
had deserted them; and they that saw, believing what the King had said,
fought with the more courage. Then there fell a great fear upon the
enemy, for these also had heard the saying, which, being in the Latin
tongue, was understood of the men of Fidenae. They, therefore, fearing
lest Mettus and the army of Alba should come down from the mountains and
shut them off from their town, began to give ground. And when the King
had broken their array, he turned the more fiercely on the men of Veii.
These also fled before him, but were hindered from escape by the river.
And some, throwing away their arms, ran blindly into the water, and some
while they lingered on the bank, and knew not whether they should fight
or fly, so perished. Never before had the Romans so fierce a fight with
their enemies.

After this the army of Alba came down from the mountains, and Mettus
said to the King that he rejoiced that he had won so great a victory,
and the King on his part spake friendly to him, and would have him join
his camp with the camp of the Romans. Also he appointed a sacrifice of
purification for the next day. And when it was day, all things being now
ready after the custom of such sacrifices, the King commanded that both
armies should be called to an assembly. And the heralds summoned the men
of Alba first, so that they might be in the inner place; to which also
they came of their own accord, for they sought to be near the King,
greatly desiring to hear what he should say. And the King so ordered it
to the end that the army of Rome might surround them on all sides. Also
he gave his commands to certain captains of hundreds that they fulfil
without delay whatsoever commands he should give them. After this the
King spoke in this fashion, "Men of Rome, if ever before ye had occasion
to give thanks for victory won, first to the immortal Gods, and secondly
to your own valour, such occasion ye found in the battle of yesterday.
For ye fought not only with the enemy, but with that from which there
is peril greater by far, even treachery in allies. I would not have you
ignorant of the truth. It was not by any ordering of mine that the men
of Alba went towards the mountains. I gave no such command; yet did I
feign that I had given it to this end, that ye might not know that ye
were deserted, and so might fight with the better courage, and that our
enemies, thinking that they should be assailed from behind, might be
stricken with fear and so fly before us. Yet I say not that all the men
of Alba are guilty of this matter. They followed their captain, even as
ye, men of Rome, would have followed me whithersoever I might have led
you. Mettus only is guilty. He contrived this departure, even as he
brought about this war, and brake the covenant that was between Alba and
Rome. And what he hath done others may dare hereafter, if I do not so
deal with him that he shall be an ensample for all that come after."
Then the captains of hundreds, having arms in their hands, laid hold
upon Mettus. After this the King spake again: "May the Gods bless to the
people of Rome, and to me, and to you also, men of Alba, that which I
purpose to do. For my purpose is to carry away the people of Alba to
Rome; the commons of Alba will I make citizens of Rome, and the nobles
will I number among our Senators. So shall there be one city and one
commonwealth." When the men of Alba heard these words, all had not
the same mind about the matter, but all kept silence, fearing to speak,
because being without arms they were compassed on every side with armed
men.

Then said the King, "Mettus, if indeed thou couldst learn faith and the
keeping of treaties, I had suffered thee to live that thou mightest have
such teaching from me. But now, seeing that thy disease is past healing,
thou shalt teach other men to hold in reverence the holy things which
thou hast despised. For even as thou wast divided in heart between Rome
and Fidenae, so shall thy body be divided." Then at the King's bidding,
they brought two chariots, with four horses harnessed to each of them;
and binding the body of Mettus to the chariots, they drave the horses
divers ways so that the man was torn asunder.

In the meanwhile there had been sent horsemen to Alba who should bring
the people to Rome; and now the army also was led thither that they
might destroy the city utterly. Great sorrow was there in Alba that day,
men knowing not for fear and grief what they should carry with them or
leave behind. For a while, indeed, they wandered through their houses,
knowing that they should not see them any more. But when the horsemen
shouted to them that they should depart, and the crash of houses which
men were now destroying began to be heard, and the dust rising up from
the outskirts of the city covered all things as with a cloud, then they
snatched up in haste each such things as they could, and so departed the
home in which they had been born and bred. Very lamentable was their cry
as they went, more especially of the women, when they saw armed men
in the temples wherein they had been wont to worship, the very gods
themselves being left, as it seemed, in captivity. And when the people
were now gone forth from their city the Romans left not one stone upon
another of all that was in the city; so that that which had been four
hundred years in building (for so long had Alba endured) perished in
one hour. Nevertheless they harmed not the temples, for so the King had
commanded.

But because Alba was thus brought to destruction, Rome increased
greatly; for the number of the citizens was increased twofold. The
Coelian hill was added to the city, in which hill, that others might the
more readily dwell there, the King himself commanded that they should
build him a palace. Also the chief houses of Alba, as the house of
Julius and of Servilius, were chosen into the Senate; and that there
might be a place of meeting for the Senate being thus multiplied, the
King built a temple and called it Hostilia, after his own name. Also
ten squadrons of horsemen were chosen out of the men of Alba. But after
certain days, when the Romans had now conquered the Sabines, and had
made treaties of peace with the Etrurians, and were in great peace and
prosperity, they and their King, there was brought tidings to Rome that
there had fallen a shower of stones on Mount Alba. Which when men could
scarce believe, they sent messengers to learn if these things were true,
who having come to Alba, found the stones lying on the ground, even as
it had been hail. Also there was heard a voice from the grove that was
on the top of the hill, saying, "Let the men of Alba do worship after
the manner of their fathers;" for they having left their country, had
left also their gods, and did worship after the manner of the Romans, or
for wrath at that which had befallen them, as is wont to be with men
in such case, had ceased from worship altogether. The Romans also, by
reason of this same voice that was heard on Mount Alba, or by warning of
the soothsayers, kept a festival of nine days. And this became a custom
for the time to come, that when there came tidings of such marvels to
Rome, there was kept a like festival. Now the end of King Tullus was
this. There came a pestilence upon the land. And when for this cause
the people were wearied of war, nevertheless the King, both because he
delighted in war, and because he believed that the young men should have
better health if they went abroad than if they tarried at home, gave
them no rest But after a while he also fell into a tedious sickness,
which so brake him both in body and mind that, whereas in time past he
thought it unworthy of a King to busy himself with matters of religion,
now he gave himself up wholly to superstition, and filled the minds of
his people also with the like thoughts, so that they regarded nothing
but this, how they should make atonement to the Gods, and so be rid of
their present distress. As for the King himself, men say that reading
the sacred book of King Numa he found therein certain sacrifices, very
secret and solemn, that should be done to Jupiter by such as would
bring him down from heaven, and that he shut himself up to do these
sacrifices; but because he set not about them rightly or did them not in
due form, there appeared to him no similitude of the immortal gods
(for such he had hoped to see); but Jupiter, having great wrath at such
unlawful dealings, struck him with lightning, and consumed both him and
his house.




CHAPTER III. ~~ THE STORY OF THE ELDER TARQUIN.

Demaratus was lord of Corinth in the land of Greece. This Demaratus had
a son who, having been driven from Corinth by strife among the citizens,
came to Tarquinii that is in the land of Etruria, and dwelt there. And
having married a wife, he had two sons born to him, Lucumo and Aruns.
(It was the custom of the princes of the Etrurians to call the eldest
son Lucumo and the younger Aruns.) This Lucumo, being very wealthy (for
his father had left to him all his riches, his brother Aruns having
died), took to wife a certain Tanaquil that was a noble lady in those
parts. Now Tanaquil could not endure that any should be preferred before
him, wherefore when the people of Tarquinii despised Lucumo, because he
was the son of a stranger, Tanaquil could not endure it, and caring
not for her country, if only she could see her husband held in honour,
purposed to depart thence and dwell elsewhere. And of all places Rome
seemed to her the best, being a new country wherein men were honoured
for their deservings rather than for their birth, and he that should
show himself brave and diligent would find occasion to win renown. So
Numa, coming from Cures that is in the land of the Sabines, had been
called to the kingdom. King Ancus also was born of a mother that was a
Sabine, nor was noble at all save for his kinship to Numa. With these
words she easily persuaded her husband, so that, gathering together all
his possessions, he departed from Tarquinii to Rome. And when he came
near to the city, at the hill that is called Janiculum, there happened
to him this marvel. As he sat in the chariot with his wife, an eagle,
having its wings stretched out, descended slowly upon him from the sky,
and carried off the hat that was upon his head. Then for a while it flew
over the chariot, making a great crying, and afterwards, as it had been
inspired to do this office, set it back upon his head, and so vanished
into the air. Now all the women of the Etrurians have great knowledge
of augury (for so they call the signs and tokens of birds), and Tanaquil
was of good courage when she saw what the eagle had done, and she
embraced her husband, and bade him hope for great honours in Rome; for
the bird, she said, had come from the sky, and the sign that it showed
concerned the crown of a man, for it had taken from his head the glory
that man's hand set upon it, that it might give it back to him from the
gods. So Lucumo and Tanaquil his wife came to Rome, hoping to do
great things; and the man dwelt there, giving out that his name was
Tarquinius. And because he was a new comer and wealthy, men took the
more note of him; also he would speak courteously to all men, and use
much hospitality, and do such service as he could to them that had need
of it And after a while King Ancus heard of him, and made acquaintance
with him, which acquaintance grew into friendship, till at the last,
having found him faithful and ready in all that was put into his charge,
whether at home or abroad, he appointed him to be guardian to his
children.

After this King Ancus died, having reigned twenty and four years, and
left two sons, not yet old enough to reign, yet nearly grown to manhood.
And some would have delayed the choosing of a king till these should
be come to full age, but Tarquinius counselled that he should be chosen
forthwith. And when the day for this choosing was appointed, having sent
out the lads to hunt, he spake to the people after this manner. "This
is no new thing that I seek the kingdom at your hands; for Tatius the
Sabine became your king, having been before not a stranger only but also
an enemy; and Numa also was called to this dignity, though he sought not
for it. As for me, I came hither so soon as I was master of myself; and
of the years of my manhood, I have lived in Rome more than in my own
country; nor have I been ill taught the ways of a King, ministering to
Ancus both at home and abroad."

With these words he persuaded the people that they chose him to be king.
Being so chosen he did many things that pleased the people; for having
waged war with the Latins, and taken one of their cities and with it
much booty, he built the great circus, and fetched horses and boxers
from the land of Etruria to make sport. This became a custom year by
year; and they called these games the Great Games of Rome.

Afterwards he would have compassed the city with a wall of stone; but
while he was busy with the building of it the Sabines came upon him. And
this they did with such speed that they had crossed the Anio before ever
the Romans were ready to meet them; and when they fought many were slain
on both sides, but neither had the victory. Now when the King, the enemy
having returned to their camp, had space to consider how he might best
make his army the stronger, it seemed that it would profit him most if
he should increase the number of his horsemen, of whom there were three
companies only. But when he was minded to add others to them, and
to call them after his own name, one Attus Navius, that was a famous
soothsayer in those days, withstood him. "For," said he, "King Romulus
made these companies in due form, and thou mayest not add to their
number, unless the gods permit, signifying their will by the voices
of birds." But the King was wroth to hear these words, and mocked the
soothsayers art, saying, "Come now, thou wise man, divine unto me, can
that which I think in my heart be done, or no?" Attus answered, having
first made trial of his art, "Of a surety it can be done." Then said the
King, "I thought this thing in my heart, that thou shouldest cut asunder
this whetstone with a razor. Take it, therefore, and cut it asunder; for
thy birds will have it that thou canst." And straightway Attus took the
whetstone and cut it asunder. So they made a statue of him, standing
with his head covered, in the place where the thing was done; even in
the place of assembly, on the right hand of the steps by which a man
goes up to the senate-house. And by his side they laid the stone to be a
memorial of this miracle to them that should come after. Certainly there
came such honour to the soothsayers that nothing thereafter was done at
home or abroad except they first allowed it; and if an assembly of the
people was called or the army gathered together, it must be dispersed
again unless the birds should signify that it was according to the
pleasure of the gods. King Tarquin, therefore, changed not the number or
the name of the companies. Only he added to each as many more horsemen
as it had at the first.

After this there was yet another battle with the Sabines; and these fled
before the Romans, the horsemen especially doing good service against
them. And the King sent them that were taken captive and the booty to
Rome; but the arms of those that were slain he made into a great heap,
and burned them with fire, for he had vowed thus to Vulcan, that is the
god of fire. And the King took Collatia, that is a town of the Sabines,
from them, and afterwards he subdued the whole nation of the Latins that
it became obedient to Rome.

They tell this story also of King Tarquin. There came to him one day
a woman bearing twelve books, which she said were books of prophecies,
wherein were written all things that should come to pass thereafter
concerning the city of Rome. These books she would have sold to him. But
because he knew not who she was, nor what she brought, and also because
the price of the books seemed great out of measure, he would have none
of them. Then the woman departed, and having burned three of the books
with fire, brought back the nine that remained, and would sell them. And
the price that she had demanded for the twelve, this she asked without
abatement for the nine. And when the King would not buy, she departed
and burned three more; and so returning would sell the six; but the
price was that which she demanded for the twelve. Then the King, being
greatly astonished, asked counsel of the priests and the soothsayers,
and so bought the books. These were kept with great care and honour at
Rome; and when in time to come there arose great need or peril in the
city, then there were appointed men of repute who should open the books
and learn what had best be done.

In those days there happened, in the palace of the King, a great marvel.
There was a certain slave boy whose name was Servius Tullius. The head
of this boy, as he slept, was seen to burn with fire; and when the King
and the Queen had been called to see this strange thing, and certain
of the servants would have fetched water wherewith to quench the fire,
Queen Tanaquil would not suffer them, but commanded that they should
leave the child as he lay. And when he woke from his sleep, lo! the
flame departed. Then said Queen Tanaquil to her husband, "Seest thou
this boy whom we rear in this humble fashion? Know that he will be in
time to come a light in our darkness, and a succour to our house in its
great trouble. Let us, therefore, use all favour and kindness to him."
Thereafter they dealt with the lad as though he were free-born and not
a slave, and gave him such teaching as befits them that are born to
high place. The lad also, on his part, showed such parts and temper as
befitted the house of a king; and when Tarquin would choose a husband
for his daughter there was not found one fitter for such honour than
Servius. So the King betrothed to him his daughter. Yet is it scarce
to be believed that he would have done this thing if Servius had been
indeed born of a bond-woman. Some say, therefore, and the story seems
worthy of belief, that he was the son of a great lady of Corniculum,
which was a town of the Latins; that this town being taken by King
Tarquin, Servius Tullius, that was its chief ruler, was slain, whose
wife, being with child, was carried to Rome; and that because she was of
noble birth she was not sold into slavery with the other women but taken
into the King's palace, and there bare this child, of whom, because his
mother had been taken captive in war, men said that he was the son of a
slave.

Now the sons of Ancus, since they had been grown to manhood, had taken
it ill that Tarquin had been preferred before them to the throne of
their father, and now they were the more angry, seeing how he had chosen
another than them to be king after him. "See, now," they said, "this
fellow that is not a Roman, nay, nor an Italian, but a stranger from
Greece, how being made tutor to us by the King our father, he filched
the throne from us by craft, and now handeth it over to one that is the
son of a bond-woman. Surely this is a shameful thing for this city and
people. For the kingdom of Romulus, that is now a god in heaven, will
pass within the space of a hundred years to one that is a slave."
