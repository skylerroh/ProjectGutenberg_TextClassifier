PREFACE


After communication with many of the teachers who have
been using the Principles and Practice of Oral Reading in their
classes, the author has made a number of important additions and
changes. In its amended form the book is published under the
title of the "Ontario High School Reader."

As the book is intended for the teaching of oral reading it
contains an introductory chapter on the Principles of Reading, and
selections for practice, with appended notes. An effort has also
been made to grade the selections in the order of their difficulty.
Accordingly, a number of selections, each illustrating in a marked
degree only one, or at most two, of the various elements of Vocal
Expression, have been placed at the beginning; these should, of
course, be taught before the more complex selections are attempted.

It is not intended that the pupil shall master the chapter on
the principles before beginning to read the selections; he should
become familiar with each topic as it is illustrated in the lesson.
In dealing with each lesson the teacher should first ascertain the
elements of vocal expression that it best exemplifies. He should
then discuss these elements with the pupils, using the necessary
paragraphs of the Introduction, and such black-board exercises as
he may deem necessary, until he is satisfied that the pupils are
ready to undertake the study of the selection. At the oral reading
the pupils should be able to show their mastery of the principles
thus taught. Toward the close of the course, they will naturally
read connectedly the various sections of the Introduction, in order
to obtain a comprehensive and systematic view of the principles.

To secure good reading, systematic drill on the exercises in
Vowel Sounds and in Articulation is also necessary.

PRINCIPLES OF READING

=Importance of Oral Reading=


There are several reasons why every boy or girl should strive to
become a good reader. In the first place, good oral reading is an
accomplishment in itself. It affords a great deal of pleasure to
others as well as to ourselves. In the second place, it improves our
everyday speech and is also a preparation for public speaking; for the
one who reads with distinctness and an accent of refinement is likely
to speak in the same way, whether in private conversation or on the
public platform. Moreover, it is only one step from reading aloud
before the class to recitation, and another step from recitation to
public speaking. Lastly, oral reading is the best method of bringing
out and conveying to others and to oneself all that a piece of
literature expresses. For example, the voice is needed to bring out
the musical effects of poetry. The following lines will illustrate
this point:

  But the sea-caves rung, and the wild winds sung
  The dirge of lovely Rosabelle.

Here the music of the rhythm and the harmony between sound and sense
would be almost entirely lost in silent reading.

The voice, too, is often the surest and most effective means of
conveying differences of meaning and feeling in both prose and poetry.
The following words from _Herve Riel_ (pp. 241-247) may be made to
convey different meanings according to the intonation of the voice:

  Burn the fleet and ruin France?

This may be read to express hesitation and deliberation, or, as is
the evident intention, shewn by the context as well as by the
punctuation, to express Herve Riel's surprise and indignation that
such a thought should be entertained.


=Mechanical Side of Oral Reading=

Now in what does oral reading consist? It consists, first of all, in
recognizing the words, pronouncing them correctly, and articulating
them distinctly. The pupil in the First Book, who is learning to read,
is trying to master this side of reading, which is the mechanical
side. He cannot be too careful as to the habits of speech he forms;
for correct position of the organs of speech and proper control of the
breath make for correct pronunciation and distinct articulation, which
are two of the foundation stones of good reading.

By =Correct Pronunciation=, we mean the pronunciation approved by a
standard dictionary. Elegance and refinement of speech depend largely
on the correct pronunciation of the vowel sounds. The vowel _a_, which
is sounded in seven different ways in the English language, presents
the greatest difficulty. Many people recognize at most, only the sound
of a in _at_, _ate_, _all_, _far_, and _mortal_ respectively. They
ignore the sound as in _air_, and the shorter quantity of the Italian
_a_ in _ask_, giving the sound of a in _ate_ to the former and of _a_
in _at_ or _a_ in _all_ or _a_ in _far_ to the latter. Another
difficulty is that of distinguishing the sound of _oo_ in _roof,
food_, etc., from the sound of _oo_ in _book_ and _good_, and from the
sound of _u_ in such words as _pure_ and _duke_.

Pronunciation, when perfectly pure, should be free from what we call
provincialisms; that is, from any peculiarity of tone, accent, or
vowel sound, which would mark the speaker as coming from any
particular locality. If our pronunciation is perfectly pure, it does
not indicate, in the slightest degree, the part of the country in
which we have lived.

=Distinct articulation= requires that each syllable should receive its
full value, and that the end of a word should be enunciated as
distinctly as the beginning. It depends largely on the way in which we
utter the consonants, just as correct pronunciation depends on the
enunciation of the vowels. Final consonants are easily slurred,
especially in the case of words ending in two or more consonants,
which present special difficulties of articulation. Such words are
_mends_, _seethes_, _thirsteth_, _breathed_, etc. Sometimes, too, the
careless reader fails to articulate two consonants separately when the
first word ends with the consonant or consonant sound with which the
second begins; for example, _Sir Richard Grenville lay_, _Spanish
ships_; or when the first word ends with a consonant and the second
begins with a vowel, as in _eats apples_, _not at all_, _an ox_, etc.
On the other hand, too evident an effort to secure the proper
enunciation of the sound elements should be avoided, since a stilted
mode of utterance is thus produced.

Exercises for drill in the vowel sounds and in articulation are
provided in Appendix A.


=Expression=

Oral reading, however, even in its earliest stages, consists in more
than recognizing words, pronouncing them correctly, and articulating
them distinctly. It includes thinking thoughts, seeing mental
pictures, (which is only another form of thinking) and feeling varied
