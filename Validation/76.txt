11.

  Keep my little tongue to-day,
  Keep it gentle while I play;
  Keep my hands from doing wrong.
  Keep my feet the whole day long;
  Keep me all, O Jesus mild,
  Keep me ever Thy dear child. Amen.


12.

  Jesus, keep me all this day.
  When at school and when at play;
  May I do all things I ought,
  May I hate each evil thought;
  Help me love and trust in Thee
  Now and through eternity. Amen.


13.

  O blessed Lord, protect Thou me
  And my dear parents graciously;
  With Thy strong arm be ever near
  To brothers and to sisters dear.
  And all our loved ones in the land,
  Protect them with Thine own right hand.
  From sin defend and keep me free;
  Help me a Christlike child to be. Amen.


14.

  My Father, for another night
  Of quiet sleep and rest.
  For all the joys of morning light,
  Thy holy name be blest. Amen.


15.

  Now with the new-born day I give
  Myself anew to Thee,
  That as Thou willest, I may live,
  And what Thou willest, be. Amen.


16.

  Lord, for the mercies of this night
  My humble thanks I pay
  And unto Thee I give myself
  To-day and every day. Amen.


17.

  Whate'er I do, things great or small
  Whate'er I speak or frame.
  Thy glory may I seek in all,
  Do all in Jesus' name.

  My Father, for His sake I pray.
  Thy child accept and bless
  And lead me by Thy grace to-day
  In paths of righteousness. Amen.


18.

I thank Thee, my heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son,
that Thou hast kept me this night from all harm and danger; and I pray
Thee that Thou wouldst keep me this day also from sin and every evil,
that all my doings and life may please Thee. For into Thy hands I
commend myself, my body and soul, and all things. Let Thy holy angel lie
with me, that the wicked Foe may have no power over me. Amen.




Evening Prayers.


19.

  Savior, lay Thy hand on me,
  Bless me, and remember me. Amen.


20.

  Now I lay me down to sleep;
  I pray Thee, Lord, my soul to keep.
  If I should die before I wake.
  I pray Thee, Lord, my soul to take;
  And this I ask for Jesus' sake. Amen.


21.

  Dear Father in heaven,
  Look down from above;
  Bless papa and mama,
  And those whom I love.

  May angels guard over
  My slumbers, and when
  The morning is breaking,
  Awake me. Amen.


22.

  Now the light has gone away;
  Savior, listen while I pray.
  Asking Thee to watch and keep
  And to send me quiet sleep.

  Jesus, Savior, wash away
  All that has been wrong to-day;
  Help me every day to be
  Good and gentle, more like Thee.

  Let my near and dear ones be
  Always near and dear to Thee.
  O bring me and all I love
  To Thy happy home above. Amen.


23.

  In my little bed I lie:
  Heavenly Father, hear my cry;
  Lord, keep Thou me through this night.
  Bring me safe to morning light. Amen.


24.

  The day is past and over,
  All thanks, O Lord, to Thee!
  O Jesus, keep me in Thy sight
  And save me through the coming night.
  Amen.


25.

  The day is done;
  O God the Son,
  Look down upon
  Thy little one!

  O Light of Light,
  Keep me this night,
  And shed round me
  Thy presence bright.

  I need not fear
  If Thou art near;
  Thou art my Savior
  Kind and dear. Amen.
