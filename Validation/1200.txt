Hansen was sitting at the control board in the single building on
Communications Relay Station 43.4SC, when the emergency light flashed
on for the first time in two hundred years.

With textbook-recommended swiftness, he located the position of the ship
sending the call, identified the ship and the name of its captain, and
made contact.

"This is Hansen on 43.4SC. Put me through to Captain Fromer."

"Fromer here," said an incredible deep voice, "what the devil do you want?"

"What do I want?" asked the astonished Hansen. "It was you, sir, who sent
the emergency call."

"I did no such thing," said Fromer with great certainty.

"But the light flashed--"

"How long have you been out of school?" Fromer asked.

"Almost a year, sir, but that doesn't change the fact that--"

"That you're imagining things and that you've been sitting on that asteroid
hoping that something would happen to break the monotony. Now leave me the
hell alone or I'll put you on report."

"Now look here," Hansen began, practically beside himself with frustration,
"I saw that emergency light go on. Maybe it was activated automatically
when something went out of order on your ship."

"I don't allow emergencies on the Euclid Queen," said Fromer with growing
anger. "Now, if you don't--"

Hansen spared himself the indignity of being cut off. He broke contact
himself. He sighed, reached for a book entitled _Emergency Procedure
Rules_, and settled back in his chair.

Fifteen minutes later the emergency light flashed on for the second time in
two hundred years. With its red glow illuminating his freckled excited
face, Hansen triumphantly placed another call to the Euclid Queen.

"This is Hansen on 43.4SC. Let me speak to Captain Fromer, please."

"Er--the Captain has asked me to contact you. I'm the navigator. I was just
about to call you. We have a small problem that--"

"I'll speak to the Captain," Hansen repeated grimly.

"Now see here. I'm perfectly capable of handling this situation. Actually,
it's hardly even an emergency. You were, it seems, signaled automatically
when--"

"If you'll check your emergency procedures," Hansen said, holding his thumb
in the Rule Book, "you'll note that the Relay Station Attendant contacts
the Captain personally during all emergencies. Of course, if you want to
violate--"

"Look, old man," said the navigator, now sounding on the verge of tears,
"try to realize the spot I'm in. Fromer has ordered me to handle this thing
without his assistance. He seems to feel that you have a grudge of some
kind--"

"If you don't put me in touch with Captain Fromer in five minutes, I'll put
through a call to Sector Headquarters." Hansen signaled off contact. If he
knew nothing else about the situation, he knew that he had the upper hand.

       *       *       *       *       *

Five minutes later Captain Fromer called him back. "I am calling in
accordance with emergency procedures," Fromer said between clinched teeth.
"The situation is this: We are reporting an emergency--"

"What class emergency?" Hansen interrupted.

"Class?" asked Fromer, obviously caught off guard.

"Yes, Captain. There are three classes of emergencies. Major class, which
would include death and injury. Mechanical class, including malfunction of
Hegler units and such. And General class--"
