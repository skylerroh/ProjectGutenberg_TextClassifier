  Bright, incorruptible; my limping son,
  Vulcan, shall fashion it himself with art
  Laborious, and, beneath, shall place a stool[3]
  For thy fair feet, at the convivial board.                     285
    Then answer thus the tranquil Sleep returned
  Great Saturn's daughter, awe-inspiring Queen!
  All other of the everlasting Gods
  I could with ease make slumber, even the streams
  Of Ocean, Sire of all.[4] Not so the King                      290
  The son of Saturn: him, unless himself
  Give me command, I dare not lull to rest,
  Or even approach him, taught as I have been
  Already in the school of thy commands
  That wisdom. I forget not yet the day                          295
  When, Troy laid waste, that valiant son[5] of his
  Sail'd homeward: then my influence I diffused
  Soft o'er the sovereign intellect of Jove;
  While thou, against the Hero plotting harm,
  Didst rouse the billows with tempestuous blasts,               300
  And separating him from all his friend,
  Brought'st him to populous Cos. Then Jove awoke,
  And, hurling in his wrath the Gods about,
  Sought chiefly me, whom far below all ken
  He had from heaven cast down into the Deep,                    305
  But Night, resistless vanquisher of all,
  Both Gods and men, preserved me; for to her
  I fled for refuge. So the Thunderer cool'd,
  Though sore displeased, and spared me through a fear
  To violate the peaceful sway of Night.[6]                      310
  And thou wouldst now embroil me yet again!
    To whom majestic Juno thus replied.
  Ah, wherefore, Sleep! shouldst thou indulge a fear
  So groundless?  Chase it from thy mind afar.
  Think'st thou the Thunderer as intent to serve                 315
  The Trojans, and as jealous in their cause
  As erst for Hercules, his genuine son?
  Come then, and I will bless thee with a bride;
  One of the younger Graces shall be thine,
  Pasithea, day by day still thy desire.                         320
    She spake; Sleep heard delighted, and replied.
  By the inviolable Stygian flood
  Swear to me; lay thy right hand on the glebe
  All-teeming, lay thy other on the face
  Of the flat sea, that all the Immortal Powers                  325
  Who compass Saturn in the nether realms
  May witness, that thou givest me for a bride
  The younger Grace whom thou hast named, divine
  Pasithea, day by day still my desire.
    He said, nor beauteous Juno not complied,                    330
  But sware, by name invoking all the powers
  Titanian call'd who in the lowest gulf
  Dwell under Tartarus, omitting none.
  Her oath with solemn ceremonial sworn,
  Together forth they went; Lemnos they left                     335
  And Imbrus, city of Thrace, and in dark clouds
  Mantled, with gliding ease swam through the air
  To Ida's mount with rilling waters vein'd,
  Parent of savage beasts; at Lectos[7] first
  They quitted Ocean, overpassing high                           340
  The dry land, while beneath their feet the woods
  Their spiry summits waved. There, unperceived
  By Jove, Sleep mounted Ida's loftiest pine
  Of growth that pierced the sky, and hidden sat
  Secure by its expanded boughs, the bird                        345
  Shrill-voiced resembling in the mountains seen,[8]
  Chalcis in heaven, on earth Cymindis named.
    But Juno swift to Gargarus the top
  Of Ida, soar'd, and there Jove saw his spouse.
  --Saw her--and in his breast the same love felt                350
  Rekindled vehement, which had of old
  Join'd them, when, by their parents unperceived,
  They stole aside, and snatch'd their first embrace.
  Soon he accosted her, and thus inquired.
    Juno! what region seeking hast thou left                     355
  The Olympian summit, and hast here arrived
  With neither steed nor chariot in thy train?
    To whom majestic Juno thus replied
  Dissembling. To the green earth's end I go,
  To visit there the parent of the Gods                          360
  Oceanus, and Tethys his espoused,
  Mother of all. They kindly from the hands
  Of Rhea took, and with parental care
  Sustain'd and cherish'd me;[9] to them I haste
  Their feuds innumerable to compose,                            365
  Who disunited by intestine strife
  Long time, from conjugal embrace abstain.
  My steeds, that lightly over dank and dry
  Shall bear me, at the rooted base I left
  Of Ida river-vein'd. But for thy sake                          370
  From the Olympian summit I arrive,
  Lest journeying remote to the abode
  Of Ocean, and with no consent of thine
  Entreated first, I should, perchance, offend.
    To whom the cloud-assembler God replied.                     375
  Juno! thy journey thither may be made
  Hereafter. Let us turn to dalliance now.
  For never Goddess pour'd, nor woman yet
  So full a tide of love into my breast;
  I never loved Ixion's consort thus                             380
  Who bore Pirithoues, wise as we in heaven;
  Nor sweet Acrisian Danaee, from whom
  Sprang Perseus, noblest of the race of man;
  Nor Phoenix' daughter fair,[10] of whom were born
  Minos unmatch'd but by the powers above,                       385
  And Rhadamanthus; nor yet Semele,
  Nor yet Alcmena, who in Thebes produced
  The valiant Hercules; and though my son
  By Semele were Bacchus, joy of man;
  Nor Ceres golden-hair'd, nor high-enthroned                    390
  Latona in the skies, no--nor thyself
  As now I love thee, and my soul perceive
  O'erwhelm'd with sweetness of intense desire.
    Then thus majestic Juno her reply
  Framed artful. Oh unreasonable haste!                          395
  What speaks the Thunderer? If on Ida's heights.
  Where all is open and to view exposed
  Thou wilt that we embrace, what must betide,
  Should any of the everlasting Gods
  Observe us, and declare it to the rest?                        400
  Never could I, arising, seek again,
  Thy mansion, so unseemly were the deed.
  But if thy inclinations that way tend,
  Thou hast a chamber; it is Vulcan's work,
  Our son's; he framed and fitted to its posts                   405
  The solid portal; thither let us his,
  And there repose, since such thy pleasure seems.
    To whom the cloud-assembler Deity.
  Fear thou not, Juno, lest the eye of man
  Or of a God discern us; at my word                             410
  A golden cloud shall fold us so around,
  That not the Sun himself shall through that veil
  Discover aught, though keenest-eyed of all.
    So spake the son of Saturn, and his spouse
  Fast lock'd within his arms. Beneath them earth                415
  With sudden herbage teem'd; at once upsprang
  The crocus soft, the lotus bathed in dew,
  And the crisp hyacinth with clustering bells;
  Thick was their growth, and high above the ground
  Upbore them. On that flowery couch they lay,                   420
  Invested with a golden cloud that shed
  Bright dew-drops all around.[11] His heart at ease,
  There lay the Sire of all, by Sleep and Love
  Vanquish'd on lofty Gargarus, his spouse
  Constraining still with amorous embrace.                       425
  Then, gentle Sleep to the Achaian camp
  Sped swift away, with tidings for the ear
  Of earth-encircler Neptune charged; him soon
  He found, and in wing'd accents thus began.
    Now Neptune, yield the Greeks effectual aid,                 430
  And, while the moment lasts of Jove's repose,
  Make victory theirs; for him in slumbers soft
  I have involved, while Juno by deceit
  Prevailing, lured him with the bait of love.
    He said, and swift departed to his task                      435
  Among the nations; but his tidings urged
  Neptune with still more ardor to assist
  The Danai; he leap'd into the van
  Afar, and thus exhorted them aloud.
    Oh Argives! yield we yet again the day                       440
  To Priameian Hector? Shall he seize
  Our ships, and make the glory all his own?
  Such is his expectation, so he vaunts,
  For that Achilles leaves not yet his camp,
  Resentful; but of him small need, I judge,                     445
  Should here be felt, could once the rest be roused
  To mutual aid. Act, then, as I advise.
  The best and broadest bucklers of the host,
  And brightest helmets put we on, and arm'd
  With longest spears, advance; myself will lead;                450
  And trust me, furious though he be, the son
  Of Priam flies. Ye then who feel your hearts
  Undaunted, but are arm'd with smaller shields,
  Them give to those who fear, and in exchange
  Their stronger shields and broader take yourselves.            455
    So he, whom, unreluctant, all obey'd.
  Then, wounded as they were, themselves the Kings,
  Tydides, Agamemnon and Ulysses
  Marshall'd the warriors, and from rank to rank
  Made just exchange of arms, giving the best                    460
  To the best warriors, to the worse, the worst.
  And now in brazen armor all array'd
  Refulgent on they moved, by Neptune led
  With firm hand grasping his long-bladed sword
  Keen as Jove's bolt; with him may none contend                 465
  In dreadful fight; but fear chains every arm.
    Opposite, Priameian Hector ranged
  His Trojans; then they stretch'd the bloody cord
  Of conflict tight, Neptune coerulean-hair'd,
  And Hector, pride of Ilium; one, the Greeks                    470
  Supporting firm, and one, the powers of Troy;
  A sea-flood dash'd the galleys, and the hosts
  Join'd clamorous. Not so the billows roar
  The shores among, when Boreas' roughest blast
  Sweeps landward from the main the towering surge;              475
  Not so, devouring fire among the trees
  That clothe the mountain, when the sheeted flames
  Ascending wrap the forest in a blaze;
  Nor howl the winds through leafy boughs of oaks
  Upgrown aloft (though loudest there they rave)                 480
  With sounds so awful as were heard of Greeks
  And Trojans shouting when the clash began.
    At Ajax, first (for face to face they stood)
  Illustrious Hector threw a spear well-aim'd,
  But smote him where the belts that bore his shield             485
  And falchion cross'd each other on his breast.
  The double guard preserved him unannoy'd.
  Indignant that his spear had bootless flown,
  Yet fearing death at hand, the Trojan Chief
  Toward the phalanx of his friends retired.                     490
  But, as he went, huge Ajax with a stone
  Of those which propp'd the ships (for numerous such
  Lay rolling at the feet of those who fought)
  Assail'd him. Twirling like a top it pass'd
  The shield of Hector, near the neck his breast                 495
  Struck full, then plough'd circuitous the dust.
  As when Jove's arm omnipotent an oak
  Prostrates uprooted on the plain, a fume
  Rises sulphureous from the riven trunk,
  And if, perchance, some traveller nigh at hand                 500
  See it, he trembles at the bolt of Jove,
  So fell the might of Hector, to the earth
  Smitten at once. Down dropp'd his idle spear,
  And with his helmet and his shield himself
  Also; loud thunder'd all his gorgeous arms.                    505
  Swift flew the Grecians shouting to the skies,
  And showering darts, to drag his body thence,
  But neither spear of theirs nor shaft could harm
  The fallen leader, with such instant aid
  His princely friends encircled him around,                     510
  Sarpedon, Lycian Chief, Glaucus the brave,
  Polydamas, AEneas, and renown'd
  Agenor; neither tardy were the rest,
  But with round shields all shelter'd Hector fallen.
  Him soon uplifted from the plain his friends                   515
  Bore thence, till where his fiery coursers stood,
  And splendid chariot in the rear, they came,
  Then Troy-ward drove him groaning as he went.
  Ere long arriving at the pleasant stream
  Of eddied Xanthus, progeny of Jove,                            520
  They laid him on the bank, and on his face
  Pour'd water; he, reviving, upward gazed,
  And seated on his hams black blood disgorged
  Coagulate, but soon relapsing, fell
  Supine, his eyes with pitchy darkness veil'd,                  525
  And all his powers still torpid by the blow.
    Then, seeing Hector borne away, the Greeks
  Rush'd fiercer on, all mindful of the fight,
  And far before the rest, Ajax the swift,
  The Oilean Chief, with pointed spear                           530
  On Satnius springing, pierced him. Him a nymph
  A Naiad, bore to Enops, while his herd
  Feeding, on Satnio's grassy verge he stray'd.
  But Oiliades the spear-renown'd
  Approaching, pierced his flank; supine he fell,                535
  And fiery contest for the dead arose.
  In vengeance of his fall, spear-shaking Chief
  The son of Panthus into fight advanced
  Polydamas, who Prothoeenor pierced
  Offspring of Areilocus, and urged                              540
  Through his right shoulder sheer the stormy lance.
  He, prostrate, clench'd the dust, and with loud voice
  Polydamas exulted at his fall.
    Yon spear, methinks, hurl'd from the warlike hand
  Of Panthus' noble son, flew not in vain,                       545
  But some Greek hath it, purposing, I judge,
  To lean on it in his descent to hell.
    So he, whose vaunt the Greeks indignant heard.
  But most indignant, Ajax, offspring bold
  Of Telamon, to whom he nearest fell.                           550
  He, quick, at the retiring conqueror cast
  His radiant spear; Polydamas the stroke
  Shunn'd, starting sideward; but Antenor's son
  Archilochus the mortal dint received,
  Death-destined by the Gods; where neck and spine               555
  Unite, both tendons he dissever'd wide,
  And, ere his knees, his nostrils met the ground.
    Then Ajax in his turn vaunting aloud
  Against renown'd Polydamas, exclaim'd.
  Speak now the truth, Polydamas, and weigh                      560
  My question well. His life whom I have slain
  Makes it not compensation for the loss
  Of Prothoeenor's life! To me he seems
  Nor base himself; nor yet of base descent,
  But brother of Atenor steed-renown'd,                          565
  Or else perchance his son; for in my eyes
  Antenor's lineage he resembles most.
    So he, well knowing him, and sorrow seized
  Each Trojan heart. Then Acamas around
  His brother stalking, wounded with his spear                   570
  Boeotian Promachus, who by the feet
  Dragg'd off the slain. Acamas in his fall
  Aloud exulted with a boundless joy.
    Vain-glorious Argives, archers inexpert!
  War's toil and trouble are not ours alone,                     575
  But ye shall perish also; mark the man--
  How sound he sleeps tamed by my conquering arm,
  Your fellow-warrior Promachus! the debt
  Of vengeance on my brother's dear behalf
  Demanded quick discharge; well may the wish                    580
  Of every dying warrior be to leave
  A brother living to avenge his fall.
    He ended, whom the Greeks indignant heard,
  But chiefly brave Peneleus; swift he rush'd
  On Acamas; but from before the force                           585
  Of King Peneleus Acamas retired,
  And, in his stead, Ilioneus he pierced,
  Offspring of Phorbas, rich in flocks; and blest
  By Mercury with such abundant wealth
  As other Trojan none, nor child to him                         590
  His spouse had borne, Ilioneus except.
  Him close beneath the brow to his eye-roots
  Piercing, he push'd the pupil from its seat,
  And through his eye and through his poll the spear
  Urged furious. He down-sitting on the earth                    595
  Both hands extended; but, his glittering blade
  Forth-drawn, Peneleus through his middle neck
  Enforced it; head and helmet to the ground
  He lopp'd together, with the lance infixt
  Still in his eye; then like a poppy's head                     600
  The crimson trophy lifting, in the ears
  He vaunted loud of Ilium's host, and cried.
    Go, Trojans! be my messengers! Inform
  The parents of Ilioneus the brave
  That they may mourn their son through all their house,         605
  For so the wife of Alegenor's son
  Boeotian Promachus must him bewail,
  Nor shall she welcome his return with smiles
  Of joy affectionate, when from the shores
  Of Troy the fleet shall bear us Grecians home.                 610
    He said; fear whiten'd every Trojan cheek,
  And every Trojan eye with earnest look
  Inquired a refuge from impending fate.
    Say now, ye Muses, blest inhabitants
  Of the Olympian realms! what Grecian first                     615
  Fill'd his victorious hand with armor stript
  From slaughter'd Trojans, after Ocean's God
  Had, interposing, changed the battle's course?
    First, Telamonian Ajax Hyrtius slew,
  Undaunted leader of the Mysian band.                           620
  Phalces and Mermerus their arms resign'd
  To young Antilochus; Hyppotion fell
  And Morys by Meriones; the shafts
  Right-aim'd of Teucer to the shades dismiss'd
  Prothoeus and Periphetes, and the prince                        625
  Of Sparta, Menelaus, in his flank
  Pierced Hyperenor; on his entrails prey'd
  The hungry steel, and, through the gaping wound
  Expell'd, his spirit flew; night veil'd his eyes.
  But Ajax Oiliades the swift                                    630
  Slew most; him none could equal in pursuit
  Of tremblers scatter'd by the frown of Jove.




                              THE ILIAD.

                               BOOK XV.




                   ARGUMENT OF THE FIFTEENTH BOOK.


Jove, awaking and seeing the Trojans routed, threatens Juno. He sends
Iris to admonish Neptune to relinquish the battle, and Apollo to
restore health to Hector. Apollo armed with the AEgis, puts to flight
the Grecians; they are pursued home to their fleet, and Telamonian
Ajax slays twelve Trojans bringing fire to burn it.




                               BOOK XV.


  But when the flying Trojans had o'erpass'd
  Both stakes and trench, and numerous slaughtered lay
  By Grecian hands, the remnant halted all
  Beside their chariots, pale, discomfited.
  Then was it that on Ida's summit Jove                            5
  At Juno's side awoke; starting, he stood
  At once erect; Trojans and Greeks he saw,
  These broken, those pursuing and led on
  By Neptune; he beheld also remote
  Encircled by his friends, and on the plain                      10
  Extended, Hector; there he panting lay,
  Senseless, ejecting blood, bruised by a blow
  From not the feeblest of the sons of Greece.
  Touch'd with compassion at that sight, the Sire
  Of Gods and men, frowning terrific, fix'd                       15
  His eyes on Juno, and her thus bespake.
    No place for doubt remains. Oh, versed in wiles,
  Juno! thy mischief-teeming mind perverse
  Hath plotted this; thou hast contrived the hurt
  Of Hector, and hast driven his host to flight.                  20
  I know not but thyself mayst chance to reap
  The first-fruits of thy cunning, scourged[1] by me.
  Hast thou forgotten how I once aloft
  Suspended thee, with anvils at thy feet,
  And both thy wrists bound with a golden cord                    25
  Indissoluble? In the clouds of heaven
  I hung thee, while from the Olympian heights
  The Gods look'd mournful on, but of them all
  None could deliver thee, for whom I seized,
  Hurl'd through the gates of heaven on earth he fell,            30
  Half-breathless. Neither so did I resign
  My hot resentment of the hero's wrongs
  Immortal Hercules, whom thou by storms
  Call'd from the North, with mischievous intent
  Hadst driven far distant o'er the barren Deep                   35
  To populous Cos. Thence I deliver'd him,
  And after numerous woes severe, he reach'd
  The shores of fruitful Argos, saved by me.
  I thus remind thee now, that thou mayst cease
  Henceforth from artifice, and mayst be taught                   40
  How little all the dalliance and the love
  Which, stealing down from heaven, thou hast by fraud
  Obtain'd from me, shall profit thee at last.
    He ended, whom imperial Juno heard
  Shuddering, and in wing'd accents thus replied.                 45
    Be witness Earth, the boundless Heaven above,
  And Styx beneath, whose stream the blessed Gods
  Even tremble to adjure;[2] be witness too
  Thy sacred life, and our connubial bed,
  Which by a false oath I will never wrong,                       50
  That by no art induced or plot of mine
  Neptune, the Shaker of the shores, inflicts
  These harms on Hector and the Trojan host
  Aiding the Grecians, but impell'd alone
  By his own heart with pity moved at sight                       55
  Of the Achaians at the ships subdued.
  But even him, oh Sovereign of the storms!
  I am prepared to admonish that he quit
  The battle, and retire where thou command'st.
    So she; then smiled the Sire of Gods and men,                 60
  And in wing'd accents answer thus return'd.[3]
    Juno! wouldst thou on thy celestial throne
  Assist my counsels, howso'er in heart
  He differ now, Neptune should soon his will
  Submissive bend to thy desires and mine.                        65
  But if sincerity be in thy words
  And truth, repairing to the blest abodes
  Send Iris hither, with the archer God
  Apollo; that she, visiting the host
  Of Greece, may bid the Sovereign of the Deep                    70
  Renounce the fight, and seek his proper home.
  Apollo's part shall be to rouse again
  Hector to battle, to inspire his soul
  Afresh with courage, and all memory thence
  To banish of the pangs which now he feels.                      75
  Apollo also shall again repulse
  Achaia's host, which with base panic fill'd,
  Shall even to Achilles' ships be driven.
  Achilles shall his valiant friend exhort
  Patroclus forth; him under Ilium's walls                        80
  Shall glorious Hector slay; but many a youth
  Shall perish by Patroclus first, with whom,
  My noble son Sarpedon. Peleus' son,
  Resentful of Patroclus' death, shall slay
  Hector, and I will urge ceaseless, myself,                      85
  Thenceforth the routed Trojans back again,
  Till by Minerva's aid the Greeks shall take
  Ilium's proud city; till that day arrive
  My wrath shall burn, nor will I one permit
  Of all the Immortals to assist the Greeks,                      90
  But will perform Achilles' whole desire.
  Such was my promise to him at the first,
  Ratified by a nod that self-same day
  When Thetis clasp'd my knees, begging revenge
  And glory for her city-spoiler son.                             95
    He ended; nor his spouse white-arm'd refused
  Obedience, but from the Idaean heights
  Departing, to the Olympian summit soar'd.
  Swift as the traveller's thought,[4] who, many a land
  Traversed, deliberates on his future course                    100
  Uncertain, and his mind sends every way,
  So swift updarted Juno to the skies.
  Arrived on the Olympian heights, she found
  The Gods assembled; they, at once, their seats
  At her approach forsaking, with full cups                      105
  Her coming hail'd; heedless of all beside,
  She took the cup from blooming Themis' hand,
  For she first flew to welcome her, and thus
  In accents wing'd of her return inquired.
    Say, Juno, why this sudden re-ascent?                        110
  Thou seem'st dismay'd; hath Saturn's son, thy spouse,
  Driven thee affrighted to the skies again?
    To whom the white-arm'd Goddess thus replied.
  Themis divine, ask not. Full well thou know'st
  How harshly temper'd is the mind of Jove,                      115
  And how untractable. Resume thy seat;
  The banquet calls thee; at our board preside,
  Thou shalt be told, and all in heaven shall hear
  What ills he threatens; such as shall not leave
  All minds at ease, I judge, here or on earth,                  120
  However tranquil some and joyous now.
    So spake the awful spouse of Jove, and sat.
  Then, all alike, the Gods displeasure felt
  Throughout the courts of Jove, but she, her lips
  Gracing with smiles from which her sable brows                 125
  Dissented,[5] thus indignant them address'd.
    Alas! how vain against the Thunderer's will
  Our anger, and the hope to supersede
  His purpose, by persuasion or by force!
  He solitary sits, all unconcern'd                              130
  At our resentment, and himself proclaims
  Mightiest and most to be revered in heaven.
  Be patient, therefore, and let each endure
  Such ills as Jove may send him. Mars, I ween,
  Already hath his share; the warrior God                        135
  Hath lost Ascalaphus, of all mankind
  His most beloved, and whom he calls his own.
    She spake, and with expanded palms his thighs
  Smiling, thus, sorrowful, the God exclaim'd.
    Inhabitants of the Olympian heights!                         140
  Oh bear with me, if to avenge my son
  I seek Achaia's fleet, although my doom
  Be thunder-bolts from Jove, and with the dead
  Outstretch'd to lie in carnage and in dust.
    He spake, and bidding Horror and Dismay                      145
  Lead to the yoke his rapid steeds, put on
  His all-refulgent armor. Then had wrath
  More dreadful, some strange vengeance on the Gods
  From Jove befallen, had not Minerva, touch'd
  With timely fears for all, upstarting sprung                   150
  From where she sat, right through the vestibule.
  She snatch'd the helmet from his brows, the shield
  From his broad shoulder, and the brazen spear
  Forced from his grasp into its place restored.
  Then reprimanding Mars, she thus began.                        155
    Frantic, delirious! thou art lost for ever!
  Is it in vain that thou hast ears to hear,
  And hast thou neither shame nor reason left?
  How? hear'st thou not the Goddess? the report
  Of white-arm'd Juno from Olympian Jove                         160
  Return'd this moment? or perfer'st thou rather,
  Plagued with a thousand woes, and under force
  Of sad necessity to seek again
  Olympus, and at thy return to prove
  Author of countless miseries to us all?                        165
  For He at once Grecians and Trojans both
  Abandoning, will hither haste prepared
  To tempest[6] us in heaven, whom he will seize,
  The guilty and the guiltless, all alike.
  I bid thee, therefore, patient bear the death                  170
  Of thy Ascalaphus; braver than he
  And abler have, ere now, in battle fallen,
  And shall hereafter; arduous were the task
  To rescue from the stroke of fate the race
  Of mortal men, with all their progeny.                         175
    So saying, Minerva on his throne replaced
  The fiery Mars. Then, summoning abroad
  Apollo from within the hall of Jove,
  With Iris, swift ambassadress of heaven,
  Them in wing'd accents Juno thus bespake.                      180
    Jove bids you hence with undelaying speed
  To Ida; in his presence once arrived,
  See that ye execute his whole command.
    So saying, the awful Goddess to her throne
  Return'd and sat. They, cleaving swift the air,                185
  Alighted soon on Ida fountain-fed,
  Parent of savage kinds. High on the point
  Seated of Gargarus, and wrapt around
  With fragrant clouds, they found Saturnian Jove
  The Thunderer, and in his presence stood.                      190
  He, nought displeased that they his high command
  Had with such readiness obey'd, his speech
  To Iris, first, in accents wing'd address'd
    Swift Iris, haste--to royal Neptune bear
  My charge entire; falsify not the word.                        195
  Bid him, relinquishing the fight, withdraw
  Either to heaven, or to the boundless Deep.
  But should he disobedient prove, and scorn
  My message, let him, next, consider well
  How he will bear, powerful as he is,                           200
  My coming. Me I boast superior far
  In force, and elder-born; yet deems he slight
  The danger of comparison with me,
  Who am the terror of all heaven beside.
    He spake, nor storm-wing'd Iris disobey'd,                   205
  But down from the Idaean summit stoop'd
  To sacred Ilium. As when snow or hail
  Flies drifted by the cloud-dispelling North,
  So swiftly, wing'd with readiness of will,
  She shot the gulf between, and standing soon                   210
  At glorious Neptune's side, him thus address'd.
    To thee, O Neptune azure-hair'd! I come
  With tidings charged from AEgis-bearing Jove.
  He bids thee cease from battle, and retire
  Either to heaven, or to the boundless Deep.                    215
  But shouldst thou, disobedient, set at nought
  His words, he threatens that himself will haste
  To fight against thee; but he bids thee shun
  That strife with one superior far to thee,
  And elder-born; yet deem'st thou slight, he saith,             220
  The danger of comparison with Him,
  Although the terror of all heaven beside.
    Her then the mighty Shaker of the shores
  Answer'd indignant. Great as is his power,
  Yet he hath spoken proudly, threatening me                     225
  With force, high-born and glorious as himself.
  We are three brothers; Saturn is our sire,
  And Rhea brought us forth; first, Jove she bore;
  Me next; then, Pluto, Sovereign of the shades.
  By distribution tripart we received                            230
  Each his peculiar honors; me the lots
  Made Ruler of the hoary floods, and there
  I dwell for ever. Pluto, for his part,
  The regions took of darkness; and the heavens,
  The clouds, and boundless aether, fell to Jove.                 235
  The Earth and the Olympian heights alike
  Are common to the three. My life and being
  I hold not, therefore, at his will, whose best
  And safest course, with all his boasted power,
  Were to possess in peace his proper third.                     240
  Let him not seek to terrify with force
  Me like a dastard; let him rather chide
  His own-begotten; with big-sounding words
  His sons and daughters govern, who perforce
  Obey his voice, and shrink at his commands.                    245
    To whom thus Iris tempest-wing'd replied,
  Coerulean-tress'd Sovereign of the Deep!
  Shall I report to Jove, harsh as it is,
  Thy speech, or wilt thou soften it? The wise
  Are flexible, and on the elder-born                            250
  Erynnis, with her vengeful sisters, waits.[7]
    Her answer'd then the Shaker of the shores.
  Prudent is thy advice, Iris divine!
  Discretion in a messenger is good
  At all times. But the cause that fires me thus,                255
  And with resentment my whole heart and mind
  Possesses, is the license that he claims
  To vex with provocation rude of speech
  Me his compeer, and by decree of Fate
  Illustrious as himself; yet, though incensed,                  260
  And with just cause, I will not now persist.
  But hear--for it is treasured in my heart
  The threat that my lips utter. If he still
  Resolve to spare proud Ilium in despite
  Of me, of Pallas, Goddess of the spoils,                       265
  Of Juno, Mercury, and the King of fire,
  And will not overturn her lofty towers,
  Nor grant immortal glory to the Greeks,
  Then tell him thus--hostility shall burn,
  And wrath between us never to be quench'd.                     270
    So saying, the Shaker of the shores forsook
  The Grecian host, and plunged into the deep,
  Miss'd by Achaia's heroes. Then, the cloud-Assembler
  God thus to Apollo spake.
    Hence, my Apollo! to the Trojan Chief                        275
  Hector; for earth-encircler Neptune, awed
  By fear of my displeasure imminent,
  Hath sought the sacred Deep. Else, all the Gods
  Who compass Saturn in the nether realms,
  Had even there our contest heard, I ween,                      280
  And heard it loudly. But that he retreats
  Although at first incensed, shunning my wrath,
  Is salutary both for him and me,
  Whose difference else had not been healed with ease.
  Take thou my shaggy AEgis, and with force                       285
  Smiting it, terrify the Chiefs of Greece.
  As for illustrious Hector, him I give
  To thy peculiar care; fail not to rouse
  His fiercest courage, till he push the Greeks
  To Hellespont, and to their ships again;                       290
  Thenceforth to yield to their afflicted host
  Some pause from toil, shall be my own concern.
    He ended, nor Apollo disobey'd
  His father's voice; from the Idaean heights,
  Swift as the swiftest of the fowls of air,                     295
  The dove-destroyer falcon, down he flew.
  The noble Hector, valiant Priam's son
  He found, not now extended on the plain,
  But seated; newly, as from death, awaked,
  And conscious of his friends; freely he breathed               300
  Nor sweated more, by Jove himself revived.
  Apollo stood beside him, and began.
    Say, Hector, Priam's son! why sittest here
  Feeble and spiritless, and from thy host
  Apart? what new disaster hath befall'n?                        305
    To whom with difficulty thus replied
  The warlike Chief.--But tell me who art Thou,
  Divine inquirer! best of powers above!
  Know'st not that dauntless Ajax me his friends
  Slaughtering at yonder ships, hath with a stone                310
  Surceased from fight, smiting me on the breast?
  I thought to have beheld, this day, the dead
  In Ades, every breath so seem'd my last.
    Then answer thus the Archer-God return'd.
  Courage this moment! such a helper Jove                        315
  From Ida sends thee at thy side to war
  Continual, Phoebus of the golden sword,
  Whose guardian aid both thee and lofty Troy
  Hath succor'd many a time. Therefore arise!
  Instant bid drive thy numerous charioteers                     320
  Their rapid steeds full on the Grecian fleet;
  I, marching at their head, will smooth, myself,
  The way before them, and will turn again
  To flight the heroes of the host of Greece.
    He said and with new strength the Chief inspired.            325
  As some stall'd horse high pamper'd, snapping short
  His cord, beats under foot the sounding soil,
  Accustom'd in smooth-sliding streams to lave
  Exulting; high he bears his head, his mane
  Wantons around his shoulders; pleased, he eyes                 330
  His glossy sides, and borne on pliant knees
  Soon finds the haunts where all his fellows graze;
  So bounded Hector, and his agile joints
  Plied lightly, quicken'd by the voice divine,
  And gather'd fast his charioteers to battle.                   335
  But as when hounds and hunters through the woods
  Rush in pursuit of stag or of wild goat,
  He, in some cave with tangled boughs o'erhung,
  Lies safe conceal'd, no destined prey of theirs,
  Till by their clamors roused, a lion grim                      340
  Starts forth to meet them; then, the boldest fly;
  Such hot pursuit the Danai, with swords
  And spears of double edge long time maintain'd.
  But seeing Hector in his ranks again
  Occupied, felt at once their courage fall'n.                   345
    Then, Thoas them, Andraemon's son, address'd,
  Foremost of the AEtolians, at the spear
  Skilful, in stationary combat bold,
  And when the sons of Greece held in dispute
  The prize of eloquence, excell'd by few.                       350
  Prudent advising them, he thus began.
    Ye Gods! what prodigy do I behold?
  Hath Hector, 'scaping death, risen again?
  For him, with confident persuasion all
  Believed by Telamonian Ajax slain.                             355
  But some Divinity hath interposed
  To rescue and save Hector, who the joints
  Hath stiffen'd of full many a valiant Greek,
  As surely now he shall; for, not without
  The Thunderer's aid, he flames in front again.                 360
  But take ye all my counsel. Send we back
  The multitude into the fleet, and first
  Let us, who boast ourselves bravest in fight,
  Stand, that encountering him with lifted spears,
  We may attempt to give his rage a check.                       365
  To thrust himself into a band like ours
  Will, doubtless, even in Hector move a fear.
    He ceased, with whose advice all, glad, complied.
  Then Ajax with Idomeneus of Crete,
  Teucer, Meriones, and Meges fierce                             370
  As Mars in battle, summoning aloud
  The noblest Greeks, in opposition firm
  To Hector and his host their bands prepared,
  While others all into the fleet retired.
  Troy's crowded host[8] struck first. With awful strides        375
  Came Hector foremost; him Apollo led,
  His shoulders wrapt in clouds, and, on his arm,
  The AEgis shagg'd terrific all around,
  Tempestuous, dazzling-bright; it was a gift
  To Jove from Vulcan, and design'd to appall,                   380
  And drive to flight the armies of the earth.
  Arm'd with that shield Apollo led them on.
  Firm stood the embodied Greeks; from either host
  Shrill cries arose; the arrows from the nerve
  Leap'd, and, by vigorous arms dismiss'd, the spears            385
  Flew frequent; in the flesh some stood infixt
  Of warlike youths, but many, ere they reach'd
  The mark they coveted, unsated fell
  Between the hosts, and rested in the soil.
  Long as the God unagitated held                                390
  The dreadful disk, so long the vollied darts
  Made mutual slaughter, and the people fell;
  But when he look'd the Grecian charioteers
  Full in the face and shook it, raising high
  Himself the shout of battle, then he quell'd                   395
  Their spirits, then he struck from every mind
  At once all memory of their might in arms.
  As when two lions in the still, dark night
  A herd of beeves scatter or numerous flock
  Suddenly, in the absence of the guard,                         400
  So fled the heartless Greeks, for Phoebus sent
  Terrors among them, but renown conferr'd
  And triumph proud on Hector and his host.
  Then, in that foul disorder of the field,
  Man singled man. Arcesilaues died                               405
  By Hector's arm, and Stichius; one, a Chief[9]
  Of the Boeotians brazen-mail'd, and one,
  Menestheus' faithful follower to the fight.
