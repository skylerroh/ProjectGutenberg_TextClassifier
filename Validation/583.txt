
    Almighty Father! I am weak,
      But thou wilt strengthen me,
    If from my heart I humbly seek
      For help and light from thee.

    When I am tempted to do wrong,
      Then, Father, pity me,
    And make my failing virtue strong;
      Help me to think of thee!

    Let Christian courage guard my youth;
      That courage give to me
    Which ever speaks and acts the truth,
      And puts its trust in thee.


HYMN.

    Will God, who made the earth and sea,
      The night, and shining day,
    Regard a little child like me,
      And listen when I pray?

    If I am hungry, poor, and cold,
      Then will he hear my cry?
    And when I shall be sick and old,
      O, then will God be nigh?

    Yes; in his holy word we read
      Of his unfailing love;
    And when his mercy most we need,
      His mercy he will prove.

    To those who seek him, he is near;
      He looks upon the heart,
    And from the humble and sincere
      He never will depart.

    He sees our thoughts, our wishes knows,
      He hears our faintest prayer;
    Where'er the faithful Christian goes,
      He finds his Father there.

    Obedient children need not fear;
      God is a faithful friend,
    And when no other help is near,
      He will deliverance send.

    Then fear not hunger, cold, or pain,
      But fear to disobey
    That power which does your life sustain,
      And guards you every day.


"THY WILL BE DONE."

    How sweet to be allowed to pray
      To God, the Holy One,
    With filial love and trust to say,--
      "Father, thy will be done!"

    We in these sacred words can find
      A cure for every ill;
    They calm and soothe the troubled mind,
      And bid all care be still.

    O, let that will, which gave me breath
      And an immortal soul,
    In joy or grief, in life or death,
      My every wish control!

    O, could my heart thus ever pray,
      Thus imitate thy Son!
    Teach me, O God, with truth to say,--
      "Thy will, not mine, be done!"


SABBATH DAY.

    How sweet upon this sacred day,
      The best of all the seven,
    To cast our earthly thoughts away,
      And think of God and heaven!

    How sweet to be allowed to pray
      Our sins may be forgiven;
    With filial confidence to say,
      "Father, who art in heaven"!

    With humble hope to bend the knee,
      And, free from folly's leaven,
    Confess that we have strayed from thee,
      Thou righteous Judge in heaven!

    And if to make all sin depart
      In vain the will has striven,
    He who regards the inmost heart
      Will send his grace from heaven.

    If from the bosom that is dear
      By cold unkindness driven,
    The heart that knows no refuge here
      Shall find a friend in heaven.

    Then hail, thou sacred, blessed day,
      The best of all the seven,
    When hearts unite their vows to pay
      Of gratitude to Heaven.


THE GOOD BOY'S HYMN ON GOING TO BED.

    How sweet to lay my weary head
    Upon my quiet little bed,
    And feel assured, that all day long
    I have not knowingly done wrong!

    How sweet to hear my mother say,
    "You have been very good to-day!"
    How sweet to see my father's joy
    When he can say, "My dear, good boy!"

    How sweet it is my thoughts to send
    To many a dear-loved distant friend,
    And feel, if they my heart could see,
    How very happy they would be!

    How sweet to think that He whose love
    Made all these shining worlds above
    My pure and happy heart can see,
    And loves a little boy like me.

GOD IS GOOD.

    Thou art good! Each perfumed flower,
      Waving fields, the dark green wood,
    The insect fluttering for an hour,--
      All things proclaim that God is good.

    I hear it in each breath of wind;
      The hills that have for ages stood,
    And clouds with gold and silver lined,
      All still repeat that God is good.

    Each little rill, that many a year
      Has the same verdant path pursued,
    And every bird, in accents clear,
      Joins in the song that God is good.

    The restless sea, with haughty roar,
      Calms each wild wave and billow rude,
    Retreats submissive from the shore,
      And swells the chorus, "God is good."

    The countless hosts of twinkling stars,
      That sing his praise with light renewed;
    The rising sun each day declares,
      In rays of glory, God is good.

    The moon, that walks in brightness, says,
      That God is good! and man, endued
    With power to speak his Maker's praise,
      Should still repeat that God is good.


EVENING.

    How beautiful the setting sun!
      The clouds how bright and gay!
    The stars, appearing one by one,
      How beautiful are they!

    And when the moon climbs up the sky,
      And sheds her gentle light,
    And hangs her crystal lamp on high,
      How beautiful is night!

    And can it be I am possessed
      Of something brighter far?
    Glows there a light within this breast
      Outshining every star?

    Yes; should the sun and stars turn pale,
      The mountains melt away,
    This flame within shall never fail,
      But live in endless day.

    This is the soul that God has given,--
      Sin may its lustre dim;
    While goodness bears it up to heaven,
      And leads it back to him.


ROBINSON CRUSOE'S HYMN.

    My Heavenly Father! all I see,
      Around me and above,
    Sends forth a hymn of praise to thee,
      And speaks thy boundless love.

    The clear blue sky is full of thee,
      The woods so dark and lone;
    The soft south-wind, the sounding sea,
      Worship the Holy One.

    The humming of the insect throng,
      The prattling, sparkling rill,
    The birds, with their melodious song,
      Repeat thy praises still.

    And thou dost hear them every one,--
      Father, thou hearest me;
    I know that I am not alone,
      When I but think of thee.


HYMN.

    It was my Heavenly Father's love
      Brought every being forth;
    He made the shining worlds above,
      And every thing on earth.

    Each lovely flower, the smallest fly,
      The sea, the waterfall,
    The bright green fields, the clear blue sky,--
      'Tis God that made them all.

    He gave me all my friends, and taught
      My heart to love them well,
    And he bestowed the power of thought,
      And speech my thoughts to tell.

    My father and my mother dear,--
      He is their father too;
    He bids me all their precepts hear,
      And all they teach me, do.

    God sees and hears me all the day,
      And 'mid the darkest night;
    He views me when I disobey,
      And when I act aright.

    He guards me with a parent's care,
      When I am all alone;
    My hymn of praise, my humble prayer,
      He hears them every one.

    God hears what I am saying now,--
      O, what a wondrous thought!
    My Heavenly Father, teach me how
      To love thee as I ought.


ON PRAYER.

    As through the pathless fields of air
      Wandered forth the timid dove,
    So the heart, in humble prayer,
      Essays to reach the throne of love.

    Like her it may return unblest,
      Like her again may soar,
    And still return and find no rest,
      No peaceful, happy shore.

    But now once more she spreads her wings,
      And takes a bolder flight,
    And see! the olive-branch she brings,
      To bless her master's sight.

    And thus the heart renews its strength,
      Though spent and tempest-driven,
    And higher soars, and brings at length
      A pledge of peace with Heaven.


"THE SPIRIT GIVETH LIFE."

    What was in the viewless wind,
      Wild rushing through the oak,
    Seemed to my listening, dreaming mind
      As though a spirit spoke?

    What is it to the murmuring stream
      Doth give so sweet a song,
    That on its tide my thoughts do seem
      To pour themselves along?

    What is it on the dizzy height,
      What in each glowing star,
    That speaks of things beyond the sight,
      And questions what they are?

    What in the rolling thunder's voice,
      What in the ocean's roar,
    Hears the grand chorus, "O, rejoice!"
      Echo from shore to shore?

    What in the gentle moon doth see
      Pure thoughts and tender love,
    And hears delicious melody
      Around, below, above?

    What bids the savage tempest speak
      Of terror and dismay,
    And wakes the agonizing shriek
      Of guilt that fears to pray?

    It is this ever-living mind;
      This little throb of life
    Hears its own echoes in the wind,
      And in the tempest's strife;

    To all that's sweet, and bright, and fair,
      Its own affections gives;
    Sees its own image everywhere,
      Through all creation lives.

    It bids the everlasting hills
      Give back the solemn tone;
    This boundless arch of azure fills
      With accents all its own.

    What is this life-inspiring mind,
      This omnipresent thought?
    How shall it ever utterance find
      For all itself hath taught?

    To Him who breathed the heavenly flame,
      Its mysteries are known;
    It seeks the source from whence it came,
      And rests in God alone.


WE NEVER PART FROM THEE.

    God, who dwellest everywhere
    God, who makest all thy care,
    God, who hearest every prayer,
        Thou who see'st the heart;

    Thou to whom we lift our eyes.
    Father, help our souls to rise,
    And, beyond these narrow skies,
        See thee as thou art!

    Let our anxious thoughts be still,
    Holy trust adore thy will,
    Holy love our bosoms fill,
        Let our songs ascend!
    Dearest friends may parted be,
    All our earthly treasures flee,
    Yet we never part from thee,
        Our eternal Friend.
