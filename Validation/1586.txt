           observance of fasts and tabus, the offering of special
           prayers and sacrifices. The ceremonial purification of the
           site, or of the building if it had been used for profane
           purposes, was accomplished by aspersions with sea water mixed
           with turmeric or red earth.
[Page 15]
           When one considers the tenacious hold which all rites and
           ceremonies growing out of what we are accustomed to call
           superstitions had on the mind of the primitive Hawaiian, it
           puzzles one to account for the entire dropping out from
           modern memory of the prayers which were recited during the
           erection of a hall for the shelter of an institution so
           festive and so popular as the hula, while the prayers and
           gloomy ritual of the temple service have survived. The
           explanation may be found, perhaps, in the fact that the
           priests of the temple held position by the sovereign's
           appointment; they formed a hierarchy by themselves, whereas
           the position of the _kumu-hula_, who was also a priest, was
           open to anyone who fitted himself for it by training and
           study and by passing successfully the _ai-lolo_[2] ordeal.
           After that he had the right to approach the altar of the hula
           god with the prescribed offerings and to present the prayers
           and petitions of the company to Laka or Kapo.

           [Footnote 2: _Ai-lolo_. See pp. 32, 34, 36.]

           In pleasing contrast to the worship of the _heiau_, the
           service of the hula was not marred by the presence of
           groaning victims and bloody sacrifices. Instead we find the
           offerings to have been mostly rustic tokens, things entirely
           consistent with light-heartedness, joy, and ecstasy of
           devotion, as if to celebrate the fact that heaven had come
           down to earth and Pan, with all the nymphs, was dancing.

           During the time the halau was building the tabus and rules
           that regulated conduct were enforced with the utmost
           strictness. The members of the company were required to
           maintain the greatest propriety of demeanor, to suppress all
           rudeness of speech and manner, to abstain from all carnal
           indulgence, to deny themselves specified articles of food,
           and above all to avoid contact with a corpse. If anyone, even
           by accident, suffered such defilement, before being received
           again into fellowship or permitted to enter the halau and
           take part in the exercises he must have ceremonial cleansing
           (_huikala_). The _kumu_ offered up prayers, sprinkled the
           offender with salt water and turmeric, commanded him to bathe
           in the ocean, and he was clean. If the breach of discipline
           was gross and willful, an act of outrageous violence or the
           neglect of tabu, the offender could be restored only after
           penitence and confession.

                                       THE KUAHU


           In every halau stood the _kuahu_, or altar, as the visible
           temporary abode of the deity, whose presence was at once the
           inspiration of the performance and the luck-bringer of the
           enterprise--a rustic frame embowered in greenery. The
           gathering of the green leaves and other sweet finery of
[Page 16]  nature for its construction and decoration was a matter of so
           great importance that it could not be intrusted to any chance
           assemblage of wild youth, who might see fit to take the work
           in hand. There were formalities that must be observed, songs
           to be chanted, prayers to be recited. It was necessary to
           bear in mind that when one deflowered the woods of their
           fronds of _ie-ie_ and fern or tore the trailing lengths of
           _maile_--albeit in honor of Laka herself--the body of the
           goddess was being despoiled, and the despoiling must be done
           with all tactful grace and etiquette.

           It must not be gathered from this that the occasion was made
           solemn and oppressive with weight of ceremony, as when a
           temple was erected or as when a tabu chief walked abroad, and
           all men lay with their mouths in the dust. On the contrary,
           it was a time of joy and decorous exultation, a time when in
           prayer-songs and ascriptions of praise the poet ransacked all
           nature for figures and allusions to be used in caressing the
           deity.

           The following adulatory prayer (_kanaenae_) in adoration of
           Laka was recited while gathering the woodland decorations for
           the altar. It is worthy of preservation for its intrinsic
           beauty, for the spirit of trustfulness it breathes. We remark
           the petitions it utters for the growth of tree and shrub, as
           if Laka had been the alma mater under whose influence all
           nature budded and rejoiced.

           It would seem as if the physical ecstasy of the dance and the
           sensuous joy of all nature's finery had breathed their spirit
           into the aspiration and that the beauty of leaf and flower,
           all of them familiar forms of the god's
           metamorphosis--accessible to their touch and for the
           regalement of their senses--had brought such nearness and
           dearness, of affection between goddess and worshiper that all
           fear was removed.

           porkling, said to be for Kane, who was not a special patron,
           _au-makua_, of the hula? The only answer the author has been
           able to obtain from any Hawaiian is that, though Kane was not
           a god of the hula, he was a near relative. On reflection, the
           author can see a propriety in devoting the reeking flesh of
           the swine to god Kane, while to the sylvan deity, Laka,
           goddess of the peaceful hula, were devoted the rustic
           offerings that were the embodiment of her charms. Her image,
           or token--an uncarved block of wood--was set up in a
           prominent part of the _kuahu_, and at the close of a
           performance the wreaths that had been worn by the actors were
           draped about the image. Thus viewed, there is a delicate
           propriety and significance in such disposal of the pig.]

           date when the Pleiades appeared in the East at sunset.
           _Maka-li'i_ was also the name of a month, by some reckoned as
           the first month of the year.]

           [Footnote 6: _Maka-lei_. The name of a famous mythological
           tree which had the power of attracting fish. It did not

           trees bearing this name, one a male, the other a female,
           which both grew at a place in Hilo called Pali-uli. One of
           these, the female, was, according to tradition, carried from
           its root home to the fish ponds in Kailua, Oahu, for the
           purpose of attracting fish to the neighboring waters. The
           enterprise was eminently successful.]

           is used to indicate a period of remote mythologic antiquity.

           section of the wall that stood over against Kahiki they
           termed _Kukulu o Kahiki_. Our geographical name Tahiti is of
           course from Kahiki, though it does not apply to the same
           region. After the close of what has been termed "the period
           of intercourse," which, came probably during the twelfth and
           thirteenth centuries, and during which the ancient Hawaiians
           voyaged to and fro between Hawaii and the lands of the South,

                   _A Prayer of Adulation to Laka_

                In the forests, on the ridges
                Of the mountains stands Laka;
                Dwelling in the source of the mists.
                Laka, mistress of the hula,
            5   Has climbed the wooded haunts of the gods,
                Altars hallowed by the sacrificial swine,
                The head of the boar, the black boar of Kane.
                A partner he with Laka;
                Woman, she by strife gained rank in heaven.
           10   That the root may grow from the stem,
                That the young shoot may put forth and leaf,
                Pushing up the fresh enfolded bud,
                The scion-thrust bud and fruit toward the East,
                Like the tree that bewitches the winter fish,
           15   Maka-lei, tree famed from the age of night.
                Truth is the counsel of night--
                May it fruit and ripen above.
                A messenger I bring you, O Laka,
                To the girding of pau.
           20   An opening festa this for thee and me;
                To show the might of the god,
                The power of the goddess,
                Of Laka, the sister,
                To Lono a wife in the heavenly courts.
           25   O Lono, join heaven and earth!
                Thine alone are the pillars of Kahiki.
                Warm greeting, beloved one,
                We hail thee!

           The cult of god Lono was milder, more humane, than that of
           Kane and the other major gods. No human sacrifices were
           offered on his altars,--The statement in verse 26 accords
           with the general belief of the Hawaiians that Lono dwelt in
           foreign parts, _Kukulu o Kahiki_, and that he would some time
           come to them from across the waters. When Captain Cook
           arrived in his ships, the Hawaiians worshiped him as the god
           Lono.

           The following song-prayer also is one that was used at the
           gathering of the greenery in the mountains and during the
           building of the altar in the halau. When recited in the halau
           all the pupils took part, and the chorus was a response in
           which the whole assembly in the halau were expected to join:

           [Footnote 15: _Hoo-ulu_. This word has a considerable range of
           meaning, well illustrated in this mele. In its simplest form,
           _ulu_, it means to grow, to become strong. Joined with the
           causative _hoo_, as here, it takes on the spiritual meaning
           of causing to prosper, of inspiring. The word "collect," used
           in the translation, has been chosen to express the double
           sense of gathering the garlands and of devoting them to the
           goddess as a religious offering. In the fourth verse this
           word, _hooulu_, is used in the sense of to heal. Compare note
           _c_.]

           simple, uncombined form, meaning to enter into and inspire.]

           The wildwoods of Hawaii furnished in great abundance and
           variety small poles for the framework of the kuahu, the
           altar, the holy place of the halau, and sweet-scented leaves
           and flowers suitable for its decoration. A spirit of fitness,
           however, limited choice among these to certain species that
           were deemed acceptable to the goddess because they were
           reckoned as among her favorite forms of metamorphosis. To go
           outside this ordained and traditional range would have been
           an offense, a sacrilege. This critical spirit would have
           looked with the greatest disfavor on the practice that in
           modern times has crept in, of bedecking the dancers with
           garlands of roses, pinks, jessamine, and other nonindigenous
           flowers, as being utterly repugnant to the traditional spirit
           of the hula.

           Among decorations approved and most highly esteemed stood
           pre-eminent the fragrant maile (pl. IV) and the star-like
           fronds and ruddy drupe of the _ie-ie_ (pl. II) and its
           kindred, the _hala-pepe_ (pl. III); the scarlet pompons of
           the _lehua_ (pl. XIII) and _ohi'a_, with the fruit of the
           latter (the mountain-apple); many varieties of fern,
           including that splendid parasite, the "bird's nest fern"
[Page 20]  (_ekaha_), hailed by the Hawaiians as Mawi's paddle; to which
           must be added the commoner leaves and lemon-colored flowers
           of the native hibiscus, the _hau_, the breadfruit, the native
           banana and the dracaena (_ti_), plate V; and lastly, richest
           of all, in the color that became Hawaii's favorite, the royal
           yellow _ilima_ (pl. VI), a flower familiar to the eyes of the
           tourist to Honolulu.

           While deft hands are building and weaving the light framework
           of the kuahu, binding its parts with strong vines and
           decorating it with nature's sumptuous embroidery, the _kumu_,
           or teacher, under the inspiration of the deity, for whose
           residence he has prepared himself by long vigil and fasting
           with fleshly abstinence, having spent the previous night
           alone in the halau, is chanting or cantillating his adulatory
           prayers, _kanaenae_--songs of praise they seem to be--to the
           glorification of the gods and goddesses who are invited to
           bless the occasion with their presence and inspiration, but
           especially of that one, Laka, whose bodily presence is
           symbolized by a rude block of wood arrayed in yellow tapa
           that is set up on the altar itself. Thus does the kumu sing:


                    _Pule Kuahu_

                El' au e Laka mai uka,
                E Laka mai kai;
                O hooulu
                O ka ilio[18] nana e hae,
            5   O ka maile hihi i ka wao,
                O ka lau-ki[19] lei o ke akua,
                O na ku'i hauoli
                O Ha'i-ka-manawa.[20]
                O Laka oe,
           10   O ke akua i ke kuahu nei, la;
                E ho'i, ho'i mai a noho i kou kuahu!

                     _Altar-Prayer_ (to Laka)

                Here am I, oh Laka from the mountains,
                Oh Laka from the shore;
                Protect us
                Against the dog that barks;

[Page 21]    5  Reside in the wild-twining maile
                And the goddess-enwreathing ti.
                All, the joyful pulses.
                Of the woman Ha'i-ka-manawa!
                Thou art Laka,
            10  The god of this altar;
                Return, return, abide in thy shrine!

           [Footnote 18: _Ilio nana e hae_. The barking of a dog, the
           crowing of a cock, the grunting of a pig, the hooting of an
           owl, or any such sound occurring at the time of a religious
           solemnity, _aha_, broke the spell of the incantation and
           vitiated the ceremony. Such an untimely accident was as much
           deprecated as were the Turk, the Comet, and the Devil by
           pious Christian souls during the Middle Ages.]

           [Footnote 19: _Lau-ki_. The leaf of the _ti_ plant--the
           same as the _ki_--(Dracaena terminalis), much used as an emblem
           of divine power, a charm or defense against malign spiritual
           influences. The kahuna often wore about his neck a fillet of
           this leaf. The _ti_ leaf was a special emblem of Ha'i-wahine,
           or of Li'a-wahine. It was much used as a decoration about the
           halau.]

           [Footnote 20: _Ha'i-ka-manawa_. It is conjectured that this is
           the same as Ha'i-wahine. She was a mythological character,
           about whom there is a long and tragic story.]

           The prayers which the hula folk of old times chanted while
           gathering the material in the woods or while weaving it into
           shape in the halau for the construction of a shrine did not
           form a rigid liturgy; they formed rather a repertory as
           elastic as the sighing of the breeze, or the songs of the
           birds whose notes embroidered the pure mountain air. There
           were many altar-prayers, so that if a prayer came to an end
           before the work was done the priest had but to begin the
           recitation of another prayer, or, if the spirit of the
           occasion so moved him, he would take up again a prayer
           already repeated, for until the work was entirely
           accomplished the voice of prayer must continue to be heard.

           The _pule_ now to be given seems to be specially suited to
           that portion of the service which took place in the woods at
           the gathering of the poles and greenery. It was designed
           specially for the placating of the little god-folk who from
           their number were addressed as _Kini o ke Akua_, the
           multitude of the little gods, and who were the counterparts
           in old Hawaii of our brownies, elfins, sprites, kobolds,
           gnomes, and other woodland imps. These creatures, though
           dwarfish and insignificant in person, were in such
           numbers--four thousand, forty thousand, four hundred
           thousand--and were so impatient of any invasion of their
           territory, so jealous of their prerogatives, so spiteful and
           revengeful when injured, that it was policy always to keep on
           the right side of them.

                      _Pule Kuahu_

                E hooulu ana I Kini[21] o ke Akua,
                Ka lehu o ke Akua,
                Ka mano o ke Akua,
                I ka pu-ku'i o ke Akua,
            5   I ka lalani Akua,
                Ia ulu mai o Kane,
                Ulu o Kanaloa;
                Ulu ka ohia, lau ka ie-ie;
                Ulu ke Akua, noho i ke kahua,
           10   A a'ea'e, a ulu, a noho kou kuahu.
                Eia ka pule la, he pule ola.

                _Chorus:_

                E ola ana oe!

                         [Translation]

                      _Altar-Prayer_

                Invoke we now the four thousand,
                The myriads four of the nimble,
                The four hundred thousand elves,
                The countless host of sprites,
            5   Rank upon rank of woodland gods.
                Pray, Kane, also inspire us;
                Kanaloa, too, join the assembly.
                Now grows the _ohi'a_, now leafs _ie-ie_;
                God enters, resides in the place;
           10   He mounts, inspires, abides in the shrine.
                This is our prayer, our plea this for life!

                    _Chorus:_

                Life shall be thine!

           From one point of view these _pule_ are not to be regarded as
           prayers in the ordinary sense of the word, but rather as
           song-offerings, verbal bouquets, affectionate sacrifices to
           the gods.

                           III.--THE GODS OF THE HULA.


           Of what nature were the gods of the old times, and how did
           the ancient Hawaiians conceive of them? As of beings having
           the form, the powers, and the passions of humanity, yet
           standing above and somewhat apart from men. One sees, as
           through a mist, darkly, a figure, standing, moving; in shape
           a plant, a tree or vine-clad stump, a bird, a taloned
           monster, a rock carved by the fire-queen, a human form, a
           puff of vapor--and now it has given place to vacancy. It was
           a goddess, perhaps of the hula. In the solitude of the
           wilderness one meets a youthful being of pleasing address, of
           godlike wit, of elusive beauty; the charm of her countenance
           unspoken authority, her gesture command. She seems one with
           nature, yet commanding it. Food placed before her remains
           untasted; the oven, _imu_,[22] in which the fascinated host
           has heaped his abundance, preparing for a feast, when opened
           is found empty; the guest of an hour has disappeared. Again
           it was a goddess, perhaps of the hula. Or, again, a traveler
           meets a creature of divine beauty, all smiles and loveliness.
           The infatuated mortal, smitten with hopeless passion, offers
           blandishments; he finds himself by the roadside embracing a
           rock. It was a goddess of the hula.

           The gods, great and small, superior and inferior, whom the
           devotees and practitioners of the hula worshiped and sought
           to placate were many; but the goddess Laka was the one to
           whom they offered special prayers and sacrifices and to whom
           they looked as the patron, the _au-makua_,[23] of that
           institution. It was for her benefit and in her honor that the
           kuahu was set up, and the wealth of flower and leaf used in
           its decoration was emblematic of her beauty and glory, a
           pledge of her bodily presence, the very forms that she, a
           sylvan deity, was wont to assume when she pleased to manifest
           herself.

           As an additional crutch to the imagination and to emphasize
           the fact of her real presence on the altar which she had been
           invoked to occupy as her abode, she was symbolized by an
           uncarved block of wood from the sacred _lama_[24] tree. This
           was wrapped in a robe of choice yellow tapa, scented with
           turmeric, and set conspicuously upon the altar.

           [Footnote 22: _Imu_. The Hawaiian oven, which was a hole in
           the ground lined and arched over with stones.]

           [Footnote 23: _Au-makua_. An ancestral god.]

           [Footnote 24: _Lama_. A beautiful tree having firm,
           fine-grained, white wood; used in making sacred inclosures
           and for other tabu purposes.]
[Page 24]
           Laka was invoked as the god of the maile, the ie-ie, and
           other wildwood growths before mentioned (pl. II). She was
           hailed as the "sister, wife, of god Lono," as "the one who by
           striving attained favor with the gods of the upper ether;" as
           "the kumu[25] hula"--head teacher of the Terpsichorean art;
           "the fount of joy;" "the prophet who brings health to the
           sick;" "the one whose presence gives life." In one of the
           prayers to Laka she is besought to come and take possession
           of the worshiper, to dwell in him as in a temple, to inspire
           him in all his parts and faculties--voice, hands, feet, the
           whole body.

           Laka seems to have been a friend, but not a relative, of the
           numerous Pele family. So far as the author has observed, the
           fiery goddess is never invited to grace the altar with her
           presence, nor is her name so much as mentioned in any prayer
           met with.

           To compare the gods of the Hawaiian pantheon with those of
           classic Greece, the sphere occupied by Laka corresponds most
           nearly to that filled by Terpsichore and Euterpe, the muses,
           respectively, of dance and of song. Lono, in one song spoken
           of as the husband of Laka, had features in common with
           Apollo.

           That other gods, Kane, Ku, Kanaloa,[26] with Lono,
           Ku-pulupulu,[27] and the whole swarm of godlings that peopled
           the wildwood, were also invited to favor the performances
           with their presence can be satisfactorily explained on the
           ground, first, that all the gods were in a sense members of
           one family, related to each other by intermarriage, if not by
           the ties of kinship; and, second, by the patent fact of that
           great underlying cause of bitterness and strife among
           immortals as well as mortals, jealousy. It would have been an
           eruptive occasion of heart-burning and scandal if by any
           mischance a privileged one should have had occasion to feel
           slighted; and to have failed in courtesy to that countless
           host of wilderness imps and godlings, the _Kini Akua_,[28]
           mischievous and irreverent as the monkeys of India, would
