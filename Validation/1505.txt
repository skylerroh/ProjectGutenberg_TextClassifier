
CHAPTER XXIX  Yowler and His Cousin Tufty

Jumper the Hare arrived at school a little late and quite out of
breath from hurrying.  His big soft eyes were shining with
excitement.  "You look as though you had had an adventure, Jumper,"
said Old Mother Nature.

"I have," replied Jumper. "It is a wonder I am here at all; I came
to near furnishing Yowler the Bob Cat a breakfast that it makes me
shiver just to think of it.  I guess if I hadn't been thinking about
him, he would have caught me."

"Tell us all about it," demanded Old Mother Nature.

"Seeing Black Pussy over here yesterday, and knowing that to-day's
lesson was to be about Yowler, I couldn't get cats out of my mind
all day yesterday," began Jumper.  "Black Pussy doesn't worry me,
but I must confess that if there is any one I fear, it is Yowler
the Bob Cat.  Just thinking about him make me nervous.  The more
I tried not to think about him, the more I did think about him,
and the more I thought about him, the more nervous I got.  Then
just before dark, on the bank of the Laughing Brook, I found some
tracks in the mud.  Those tracks were almost round, and that fact
was enough to tell me who had made them.  They were Yowler's
footprints, and they hadn't been made very long.

"Of course, seeing those footprints made me more nervous than ever,
and every time I saw a leaf move I jumped inside.  My heart felt
as if it were up in my throat most of the time.  I had a feeling
that Yowler wasn't far away.  I hate that Cat!  I hate the way he
hunts!  He goes sneaking about, without making a sound, or else he
lies in wait, ready to spring without warning on the first one who
happens along.  A fellow never knows where to watch out for Yowler.

"I spent nearly all night sitting under a little hemlock tree with
branches very close to the ground.  I sat there because I didn't
dare do anything else.  As long as I stayed there I felt reasonably
safe, because Yowler would have to find me, and to do that he would
have to cross an open place where I could see him.  I knew that if
I went roaming about I might walk right into his clutches.

"It was lucky I had sense enough to stay there.  You know the moon
was very bright last night.  It made that open place in front of
where I was hiding almost as light as day.  Once I closed my eyes
for just a minute.  When I opened them, there was Yowler sneaking
across that open place.  Where he had come from, I don't know.  He
hadn't made a sound.  Not a leaf rustled under his big feet.  Right
in the middle of that open place, where the moonlight was brightest,
he stopped to listen, and I simply held my breath."

"Tell us how he looked," prompted Old Mother Nature.

"He looked just like what he is--a big Cat with a short tail,"
replied Jumper.  "Just to look at him any one would know he was
own cousin to Black Pussy.  He had a round head, rather long legs,
and was about twice as big as Black Pussy.  His feet looked big,
even for him.  On the tips of his ears were a few long black hairs.
His coat was yellowish to reddish-brown, with dark spots on it.
His chin and throat were white, and underneath he was white spotted
with black.  There were spots all down his legs.  He didn't have
enough of a tail to call it a tail.  It was whitish on the under
side and had black stripes on the upper side, and all the time he
kept twitching it just the way Black Pussy twitches her tail when
she is out hunting.  All of a sudden he opened his mouth and gave
such a yell that it is a wonder I didn't jump out of my skin.  It
frightened me so that I couldn't have moved if I had wanted to,
which was a lucky thing for me.  The instant he yelled he cocked
his head on one side and listened.  That yell must have wakened
somebody and caused them to move, for Yowler turned suddenly and
crept swiftly and without a sound out of sight.  A minute later
I heard a jump, and then I heard a fluttering.  I think he caught
one of the Grouse family."

"Yelling that way is one of Yowler's tricks," explained Old Mother
Nature.  "He does it for the same reason Hooty the Owl hoots.  He
hopes that it will startle some sleeper so that they will move.
If they do, his keen ears are sure to hear it.  Was that all of
your adventure, Jumper?"

"No," replied Jumper.  "I remained right where I was for the rest
of the night.  Just as daylight was beginning to steal through the
Green Forest, I decided that it was safe to leave my hiding place
and come over here.  Half-way here I stopped for a few minutes in
a thick clump of ferns.  I was just about to start on again when I
caught sight of something moving just back of an old stump.  It
was that foolish looking tail of Yowler's.  Had he kept it still I
wouldn't have seen him at all; but he was twitching it back and
forth.  He was crouched down close to the ground with all four
feet drawn close together under him.  There he crouched, and there
I sat for the longest time.  I didn't move, and he didn't move,
save that foolish looking tail of his.  I had begun to think that
I would have to stay in that clump of ferns all day when suddenly
Yowler sprang like a flash.  There was a little squeak, and then I
saw Yowler trot away with a Mouse in his mouth.  I guess he must
have seen that Mouse go in a hole and knew that if he waited long
enough it would come out again.  As soon as Yowler disappeared I
hurried over here.  That's all."

"That was a splendid account of Yowler and his way of hunting," said
Old Mother Nature.  "He does most of his hunting in just that way,
sneaking about on the chance of surprising a Rabbit, Bird or Mouse,
or else patiently watching and waiting beside a hole in which he
knows some one has taken refuge.  He hunts in the Green Forest
exactly as Black Pussy, Farmer Brown's Cat, hunts Mice in the barn
or Birds in the Old Orchard.  In the spring Yowler destroys many
eggs and young birds, not only those found in nests on the ground,
but also those in nests in trees, for he is a splendid climber.

"Yowler is found in nearly all of the swampy, brushy and wooded
parts of the whole country, excepting in the great forests of the
Far North, where his cousin Tufty the Lynx lives.  Yowler is
himself a Lynx, the Bay Lynx.  In some places he is called simply
Wild Cat.  In others he is called the Catamount.  He is not so
fond of the thick forests as he is of swamps, brush-grown hillsides,
old pastures and places where there are great masses of briars.
Rocky ledges where there are caves in which to hide and plenty of
brush also suit him.  He is a coward, but when cornered will fight,
though he will run from a little Dog half his size and take to a
tree.  In the South he is quite common and there often steals
Chickens and Turkeys, even young Pigs.  He prefers to hunt at
night, but sometimes is seen in broad daylight.  Mrs. Yowler's
kittens are born in a cave or in a hollow tree.  Despite the fact
that he is an expert climber, Yowler spends most of his time on
the ground and is one of the worst enemies of Rabbits, Mice,
Squirrels and ground Birds.

"In the great forests of the Far North lives Yowler's cousin, Tufty
the Canada Lynx, also called Loup Cervier and Lucivee.  He is nearly
a third larger than Yowler.  From the tip of each ear long tufts of
black hair stand up.  On each side of his face is a ruff of long
hair.  His tail is even shorter than Yowler's, and the tip of it is
always wholly black.  His general color is gray, mottled with brown.
His face ruff is white with black border.  Yowler's feet are large,
but Tufty's are immense for his size.  This is because Tufty lives
where the snow lies deep for many months, and these big, broad feet
enable him to travel about on the snow without breaking through.  He
can travel with ease where Reddy Fox, not half his size and weight,
would break through at every step.  Tufty's ways are much like those
of his cousin, Yowler, save that he is a dweller in the deep woods.
Anything he can catch is food for Tufty, but his principal food is the
Northern Hare.  The color of his coat blends with the shadows so that
he seems like a living shadow himself.  In summer food is plentiful,
and Tufty lives well, but in winder Tufty has hard work to get enough.
Rarely does he know what a full stomach means then.  Like Howler he
can go a surprising length of time without food and still retain his
strength.  At that time of year he is a great traveler.  He has to
be, in order to live.

"There is no fiercer looking animal in all the Green Forest than
Tufty the Lynx, but despite this he is, like most Cats, cowardly.
Only when cornered will he fight.  He is possessed of a lively
curiosity, and often he will stealthily follow a hunter or trapper
for miles.  The fur of his coat is very long and handsome, and he
is hunted and trapped for this.  As he lives for the most part far
from the homes of men, he does less damage to man than does his
cousin, Yowler the Bob Cat.  Tufty must depend wholly for his living
on the little people of the Green Forest.  Sometimes he will attack
a Fox.  The pretty little spotted babies of Lightfoot the Deer are
victims whenever he can find them.

"The darker and deeper the Green Forest, the better Tufty likes
it.  He makes his den under great tangles of fallen trees or
similar places.  Mr. And Mrs. Tufty often hunt together, and in
early winter the whole family often join in the hunt.

"Yowler and Tufty are the only members of the Cat family now found
in the eastern part of the country.  Formerly, their big cousin,
Puma the Panther, lived in the East, but he has been so hunted by
man that now he is found only in the mountains of the Far West and
in a few of the wildest places in the South.  I will tell you about
him to-morrow."



CHAPTER XXX  Some Big and Little Cat Cousins

"Puma the Panther," began Old Mother Nature, "is the largest member
of the Cat family in this country, with the exception of one which is
found only in the extreme Southwest.  Puma is also called Mountain
Lion, Cougar and Painter.  You all know how Black Pussy looks.  If
Black Pussy could grow to be over eight feet long and be given a
yellowish-brown coat, whitish underneath, she would look very much
like Puma the Panther.  Unlike Yowler the Bob Cat and Tufty the Lynx,
Puma has a long tail--just such a round tail as Black Pussy has.
Being so large, Puma is of great strength, and he has all the grace
and quickness in movement of a true Cat.  As I told you yesterday,
there was a time when Puma lived in the East.  In fact, he was once
in nearly all parts of this great country where there were forests.
But as the country became settled by man, Puma was driven out, and
now his home is chiefly in the great mountains of the Far West.

"Being so big, he must have much food.  Instead of depending for his
living on small animals and birds, Puma hunts the large animals.  He
is so big and so strong that he can kill Lightfoot the Deer without
trouble, and there is no one Lightfoot dreads more than Puma.  He is
especially fond of Horse flesh, and in certain sections where herds
of Horses are pastured, he has killed so many young Horses that he
has won the undying hate of man.

"Big as he is, he is a coward and will run from a barking Dog.
When desperate with hunger, he has been known to attack man, but
such occasions have been very, very rare.  The fact is, he fears
man and will slink sway at his approach.  Like the true Cat that
he is, he is wonderfully soft-footed and, despite his great size,
moves silently.  He makes his home among the ledges high up in the
mountains.  At night he goes forth to hunt.  Once in a while he is
seen hunting in daytime, but not often.  Sometimes he may be seen
basking in the sun, high up on the ledges.  He is a good climber,
like most Cats.  He never shows himself boldly, but slinks about
through the forest and among the rocks, the picture of stealth.
This habit has won for him another name--that of Sneak Cat.
Sometimes he sneaks up on his prey to within jumping distance.
Again he lies in wait beside a path which certain animals are in
the habit of using.  He is capable of leaping a long distance, and
when he strikes his prey his great weight, added to the force of
his spring, is almost certain to knock it down, even though it be
much bigger than Puma himself.

"Men hunt him with Dogs, for as I have already told you he will run
from a barking Dog.  Usually he doesn't run far before taking to a
tree.  The hunters follow and shoot him there.  Were it not that he
can be hunted in this way with Dogs, he would have little to fear
from man, for he is so keen of sight and hearing and can move so
swiftly and silently, that it is rarely man can surprise him.
Sometimes he will follow a man just as Tufty the Lynx does, but
usually for the same reason--curiosity.  Despite the fact that he
is a sneak and coward, he is so big and fierce-looking that he is
feared by most men.  Only those who really know him do not fear him.

"There is one other member of the Cat family in all this great land
larger than Puma, and this is Jaguar, also called El Tigre.  He is
found only in a small part of the extreme Southwest, for he really
belongs in the hot country to the south of this.  Not only is he
the largest, but he is the handsomest of all the Cat family.  His
coat is a beautiful deep yellow, covered with spots and rosettes of
black.  Beneath he is white with large black spots.  He also has a
fairly long tail.  He is thick and heavy, and is not as long as
Puma, but is stouter and heavier.  He can kill Horses, Mules and
Cattle with ease, but of course the principal part of his food
consists of the wild animals about him.  He is so savage in appearance
that the mere sight of him always awakens fear.  His method of hunting
is much the same as that of the other members of the Cat family.  Most
of his hunting is done at night.  While Puma the panther sometimes
screams, Jaguar roars, and it is a very terrifying sound.  All the
little people and most of the big ones within hearing shiver when
they hear it.  Jaguar's head is large and he is tremendously strong
in the jaws.  Occasionally Jaguar is all black instead of being
yellow and spotted.

"In this same part of the great Southwest lives a smaller cousin
named Ocelot, often called Tiger Cat.  Ocelot is only a little
bigger than Black Pussy, whom you all know, and in shape is very
like her.  He also has a lovely coat.  It is yellow, not a deep,
rich yellow like Jaguar's, but a light yellow, thickly covered with
black spots.  On his cheeks and the back of his neck are black lines,
and his tail is ringed with black.  He likes best country where the
brush is very thick and thorny, for there he can hunt in safety,
with little fear of being hunted by man.  Because of his smaller
size, he lives chiefly on small animals, birds and reptiles.  He
sometimes kills and eats big Snakes.  When he happens to live near
man, he robs the Hen roosts just as Yowler does.  In all his ways
he is like the other members of the Cat family.

"A neighbor of his in that same country is the queerest looking
member of the Cat family.  He is called the Jaguarundi Cat or
Eyra.  Sometimes he is dressed in dull gray and sometimes in rusty
red.  His body is shaped more like that of Little Joe Otter than
of any one else, and he has short legs and a long tail.  He is a
little larger than Little Joe, and his head is rather small and
somewhat flattened, not so round as the heads of most of the
other members of the Cat family.  He likes to be in the vicinity
of water and is a good swimmer.  Not very much is known by man
about his habits, but he is a true Cat, and the habits of all
Cats are much the same."



CHAPTER XXXI  Bobby Coon Arrives

Old Mother Nature was just about to open school when a slight noise
up the Lone Little Path drew all eyes in that direction.  There,
shuffling down the Lone Little Path, was a queer looking fellow.
No one needed more than one look at that funny, sharp, black and
white face of his to recognize him.

"Bobby Coon!" shouted Peter Rabbit.  "Are you coming to join our
school, Bobby?"

Bobby shuffled along a little nearer, then sat up and blinked at
them sleepily.  No one needed to be told that Bobby had been out
all night.  He rubbed his eyes and yawned.  "Hello, everybody,"
said he.  "I wish I felt as bright and lively as all of you look.
I'd like to join your school, but I'm afraid if I did I would go
to sleep right in the middle of the lesson.  I ought to have been
home an hour ago.  So I guess I'll have to be excused."

Old Mother Nature pointed an accusing finger at Bobby Coon.
"Bobby," said she, "You've been getting in mischief.  Now own up
you've been stealing some of that sweet, milky corn from Farmer
Brown's cornfield."

Bobby Coon hung his head.  "I--I--I don't think it was stealing," he
mumbled.  "That corn just grows, and I don't see why I shouldn't have
my share of it.  I help myself to other things, so why shouldn't I
help myself to that?"

"I'll tell you why," replied Old Mother Nature.  "Farmer Brown
planted that corn and took care of it.  If he hadn't planted it,
there wouldn't have been any corn there.  That makes it his corn.
If it grew wild, you would have a perfect right to it.  As it is,
you haven't any right to it at all.  Now take my advice, Bobby, and
keep away from that cornfield.  If you don't, you will get in trouble.
One of these fine nights Bowser the Hound will find you there and you
will have to run for your life.  Keep away from temptation."

"But that corn is so good," sighed Bobby Coon, smacking his lips.
"There is nothing I like better than sweet, milky corn, and if I
don't get it from Farmer Brown's cornfield, I can't get it at all,
for it doesn't grow wild.  He'll never miss the little I take."

Old Mother Nature shook her head and looked very grave.  "Bobby,"
said she, "that is no excuse at all.  Mark what I say: If you keep
on you certainly will get in trouble.  If you would be satisfied
to take just an ear or two, I don't believe Farmer Brown would care,
but you know very well that you spoil many times what you eat.  You
sample one ear, then think that probably the next ear will be better
and sweeter and you try that.  By the time you get through you have
spoiled a lot, and eaten only a little.  I think I'll punish you a
little myself by keeping you here a while.  If you think you can't
keep awake, just go over and sit down there by Prickly Porky; he'll
keep you awake."

"I--I think I can keep awake," stammered Bobby and opened his eyes
very wide as if he were trying to stretch his eyelids so as to make
them stay open.

"I'll help you by asking you a few questions," replied Old Mother
Nature.  "Who is it that people sometimes call you the little
cousin of?"

Bobby grinned. "Buster Bear," said he.

"That's right," replied Old Mother Nature.

"Of course, being a Raccoon, you are not a Bear, but you are related
to the Bear family.  I want you all to notice Bobby's footprints
over yonder.  You will see that the print of his hind foot shows
the whole foot, heels and toes, and is a lot like Buster Bear's
footprint on a small scale.  Bobby shuffles along in much the same
way that Buster walks.  No one ever mistakes Bobby Coon for any one
else.  There is no danger that any one ever will as long as he
carries that big, bushy tail with its broad black and gray rings.
There is only one other in all this great country with a tail so
marked, and that is a relative of Bobby's of whom I will tell you
later.  And there is no other face like Bobby's with its black
cheeks.  You will notice that Bobby is rather small around the
shoulders, but is big and heavy around the hips.  That gives him
a clumsy look, but he is anything but clumsy.  Despite the fact
that his legs are not very long Bobby is a very good runner.
However, he doesn't do any running unless he has to.  Bobby, where
were you before you went over to Farmer Brown's cornfield?"

Once more Bobby hung his head.  It was quite clear that Bobby
didn't want to answer that question.  But Old Mother Nature
insisted, and finally Bobby blurted it out.  "I was up to Farmer
Brown's hen house," said he.

"What for?" asked Old Mother Nature.

"Oh, just to look around," replied Bobby.

"To look around for what?" insisted Old Mother Nature.

"Well," said Bobby, "I thought one of those Hens up there might
have dropped an egg that she didn't really care about."

"Bobby," said Old Mother Nature sternly, "why don't you own up
that you went over there to try to steal eggs?  Or did you think
you might catch a tender young Chicken?  Where were you night
before last?"

"Over at the Laughing Brook and the Smiling Pool," replied Bobby
promptly, evidently glad the subject had been changed.

"Well, you didn't find sweet corn or eggs or Chickens over there,
did you?" said Old Mother Nature.

"No, but I caught three of the sweetest tasting little fish in a
little pool in the Laughing Brook, and I got some of the tenderest
Clams I've ever eaten," replied Bobby, smacking his lips.  "I raked
them out of the mud and opened them.  Down at the Smiling Pool I
had a lot of fun catching young Frogs.  I certainly do like Frogs.
It is great sport to catch them, and they are fine eating."

"I suppose you have had an eye on the beech trees and the wild
grape-vines," said Old Mother Nature slyly.

Bobby's face brightened.  "Indeed I have," said he.  "There will
be splendid crops of beechnuts and grapes this fall.  My, but
they will taste good!"

Old Mother Nature laughed.  "There is small danger that you will go
hungry," said she.  "When you can't find enough to eat times must
be very hard indeed.  For the benefit of the others you might add
that in addition to the things mentioned you eat other fruits,
including berries, insects of various kinds, birds when you can
catch them, Mice, Turtles, in fact almost anything that can be
eaten.  You are not at all fussy about the kind of food.  But
you have one habit in regard to your food which it would be well
if some of these other little folks followed.  Do you know what
it is?"

Bobby shook his head.  "No," said he, "not unless you mean the
habit I have of washing my food.  If there is any water near,
I always like to take what I am going to eat over to it and wash
it; somehow it tastes better."

"Just so," replied Old Mother Nature.  "More than once I've seen
you in the moonlight beside the Laughing Brook washing your food,
and it has always pleased me, for there is nothing like cleanliness
and neatness.  Did you raise a family this year, Bobby?"

"Mrs. Coon did.  We had four of the finest youngsters you have ever
seen over in a certain big hollow tree.  They are getting big and
lively now, and go out with their mother every night.  I do hope
the hunters will leave them alone this fall.  I hate to think of
anything happening to them.  If they can just get through the
hunting season safely, I'll enjoy my winter sleep better, and I
know Mrs. Coon will."
