ceive and understand that Spirit cannot become less than [5]
Spirit; hence that the universe of God is spiritual,--even
the ideal world whose cause is the self-created Principle,
with which its ideal or phenomenon must correspond in
quality and quantity.

The fallacy of an unscientific statement is this: that [10]
matter and Spirit are one and eternal; or, that the phe-
nomenon of Spirit is the antipode of Spirit, namely, mat-
ter. Nature declares, throughout the mineral, vegetable,
and animal kingdoms, that the specific nature of all things
is unchanged, and that nature is constituted of and by [15]
Spirit.

Sensuous and material realistic views presuppose that
nature is matter, and that Deity is a finite person con-
taining infinite Mind; and that these opposites, in sup-
positional unity and personality, produce matter,--a [20]
third quality unlike God. Again, that matter is both
cause and effect, but that the effect is antagonistic to its
cause; that death is at war with Life, evil with good,--
and man a rebel against his Maker. This is neither
Science nor theism. According to Holy Writ, it is a [25]
kingdom divided against itself, that shall be brought
to desolation.

The nature of God must change in order to become
matter, or to become both finite and infinite; and matter
must _dis_appear, for Spirit to appear. To the material [30]
sense, everything is matter; but spiritualize human
thought, and our convictions change: for spiritual sense

[Page 218.]

takes in new views, in which nature becomes Spirit; and [1]
Spirit is God, and God is good. Science unfolds the fact
that Deity was forever Mind, Spirit; that matter never
produced Mind, and _vice versa_.

The visible universe declares the invisible only by re- [5]
version, as error declares Truth. The testimony of mate-
rial sense in relation to existence is false; for matter can
neither see, hear, nor feel, and mortal mind must change
all its conceptions of life, substance, and intelligence,
before it can reach the immortality of Mind and its ideas. [10]
It is erroneous to accept the evidence of the material
senses whence to reason out God, when it is conceded
that the five personal senses can take no cognizance of
Spirit or of its phenomena. False realistic views sap the
Science of Principle and idea; they make Deity unreal [15]
and inconceivable, either as mind or matter; but Truth
comes to the rescue of reason and immortality, and unfolds
the real nature of God and the universe to the spiri-
ual sense, which beareth witness of things spiritual, and
not material. [20]

To begin with, the notion of Spirit as cause and end,
with matter as its effect, is more ridiculous than the "grin
without a cat;" for a grin expresses the nature of a cat,
and this nature may linger in memory: but matter does
not express the nature of Spirit, and matter's graven [25]
grins are neither eliminated nor retained by Spirit. What
can illustrate Dr. ----'s views better than Pat's echo,
when he said "How do you do?" and echo answered,
"Pretty well, I thank you!"

Dr. ---- says: "The recognition of teleology in nature [30]
is necessarily the recognition of purely spiritual personality
in God."

[Page 219.]

According to lexicography, teleology is the science of [1]
the final cause of things; and divine Science (and all
Science is divine) neither reveals God in matter, cause
in effect, nor teaches that nature and her laws are the
_material_ universe, or that the personality of infinite Spirit [5]
is finite or material. Jesus said, "Ye do err, not know-
ing the Scriptures, nor the power of God." Now, what
saith the Scripture? "God is a Spirit: and they that
worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in
truth." [10]




Mental Practice


It is admitted that mortals think wickedly and act
wickedly: it is beginning to be seen by thinkers, that
mortals think also after a sickly fashion. In common
parlance, one person feels sick, another feels wicked. A [15]
third person knows that if he would remove this feeling
in either case, in the one he must change his patient's
consciousness of dis-ease and suffering to a consciousness
of ease and loss of suffering; while in the other he must
change the patient's sense of sinning at ease to a sense of [20]
discomfort in sin and peace in goodness.

This is Christian Science: that mortal mind makes
sick, and immortal Mind makes well; that mortal mind
makes sinners, while immortal Mind makes saints; that
a state of health is but a state of consciousness made mani- [25]
fest on the body, and _vice versa_; that while one person
feels wickedly and acts wickedly, another knows that if
he can change this evil sense and consciousness to a good
sense, or conscious goodness, the fruits of goodness will
follow, and he has reformed the sinner. [30]

[Page 220.]

Now, demonstrate this rule, which obtains in every [1]
line of mental healing, and you will find that a good rule
works one way, and a false rule the opposite way.

Let us suppose that there is a sick person whom an-
other would heal mentally. The healer begins by mental [5]
argument. He mentally says, "You are well, and you
know it;" and he supports this silent mental force by
audible explanation, attestation, and precedent. His
mental and oral arguments aim to refute the sick man's
thoughts, words, and actions, in certain directions, and [10]
turn them into channels of Truth. He persists in this
course until the patient's mind yields, and the harmonious
thought has the full control over this mind on the point
at issue. The end is attained, and the patient says and
feels, "I am well, and I know it." [15]

This mental practitioner has changed his patient's
consciousness from sickness to health. The patient's
mental state is now the diametrical opposite of what it
was when the mental practitioner undertook to transform
it, and he is improved morally and physically. [20]

That this mental method has power and bears fruit,
is patent both to the conscientious Christian Scientist and
the observer. Both should understand with equal clear-
ness, that if this mental process and power be reversed,
and people believe that a man is sick and knows it, and [25]
speak of him as being sick, put it into the minds of others
that he is sick, publish it in the newspapers that he is
failing, and persist in this action of mind over mind, it
follows that he will believe that he is sick,--and Jesus
said it would be according to the woman's belief; but if [30]
with the certainty of Science he knows that an error of
belief has not the power of Truth, and cannot, does

[Page 221.]

not, produce the slightest effect, it has no power over [1]
him. Thus a mental malpractitioner may lose his
power to harm by a false mental argument; for it
gives one opportunity to handle the error, and when
mastering it one gains in the rules of metaphysics, and [5]
thereby learns more of its divine Principle. Error pro-
duces physical sufferings, and these sufferings show
the fundamental Principle of Christian Science; namely,
that error and sickness are one, and Truth is their
remedy. [10]

The evil-doer can do little at removing the effect of sin
on himself, unless he believes that sin has produced the
effect and knows he is a sinner: or, knowing that he is a
sinner, if he denies it, the good effect is lost. Either of
these states of mind will stultify the power to heal men- [15]
tally. This accounts for many helpless mental practi-
tioners and mysterious diseases.

Again: If error is the cause of disease, Truth being
the cure, denial of this fact in one instance and
acknowledgment of it in another saps one's under- [20]
standing of the Science of Mind-healing, Such denial
dethrones demonstration, baffles the student of Mind-
healing, and divorces his work from Science. Such de-
nial also contradicts the doctrine that we must mentally
struggle against both evil and disease, and is like saying [25]
that five times ten are fifty while ten times five are not
fifty; as if the multiplication of the same two numbers
would not yield the same product whichever might serve
as the multiplicand.

Who would tell another of a crime that he himself is [30]
committing, or call public attention to that crime? The
belief in evil and in the process of evil, holds the issues

[Page 222.]

of death to the evil-doer. It takes away a man's proper [1]
sense of good, and gives him a false sense of both evil
and good. It inflames envy, passion, evil-speaking, and
strife. It reverses Christian Science in all things. It
causes the victim to believe that he is advancing while [5]
injuring himself and others. This state of false conscious-
ness in many cases causes the victim great physical suffering;
and conviction of his wrong state of feeling reforms
him, and so heals him: or, failing of conviction and re-
form, he becomes morally paralyzed--in other words, [10]
a moral idiot.

In this state of misled consciousness, one is ready to
listen complacently to audible falsehoods that once he
would have resisted and loathed; and this, because the
false seems true. The malicious mental argument and [15]
its action on the mind of the perpetrator, is fatal, morally
and physically. From the effects of mental malpractice
the subject scarcely awakes in time, and must suffer its
full penalty after death. This sin against divine Science
is cancelled only through human agony: the measure it [20]
has meted must be remeasured to it.

The crimes committed under this new _regime_ of mind-
power, when brought to light, will make stout hearts quail.
Its mystery protects it now, for it is not yet known. Error
is more abstract than Truth. Even the healing Principle, [25]
whose power seems inexplicable, is not so obscure; for
this is the power of God, and good should seem more
natural than evil.

I shall not forget the cost of investigating, for this age,
the methods and power of error. While the ways, means, [30]
and potency of Truth had flowed into my consciousness
as easily as dawns the morning light and shadows flee,

[Page 223.]

the metaphysical mystery of error--its hidden paths, [1]
purpose, and fruits--at first defied me. I was say-
ing all the time, "Come not thou into the secret"--
but at length took up the research according to God's
command. [5]

Streams which purify, necessarily have pure fountains;
while impure streams flow from corrupt sources. Here,
divine light, logic, and revelation coincide.

Science proves, beyond cavil, that the tree is known
by its fruit; that mind reaches its own ideal, and cannot [10]
be separated from it. I respect that moral sense which
is sufficiently strong to discern what it believes, and to say,
if it must, "I discredit Mind with having the power to
heal." This individual disbelieves in Mind-healing, and
is consistent. But, alas! for the mistake of believing in [15]
mental healing, claiming full faith in the divine Principle,
and saying, "I am a Christian Scientist," while doing
unto others what we would resist to the hilt if done unto
ourselves.

May divine Love so permeate the affections of all those [20]
who have named the name of Christ in its fullest sense,
that no counteracting influence can hinder their growth
or taint their examples.




Taking Offense


There is immense wisdom in the old proverb, "He [25]
that is slow to anger is better than the mighty." Hannah
More said, "If I wished to punish my enemy, I should
make him hate somebody."

To punish ourselves for others' faults, is superlative
folly. The mental arrow shot from another's bow is [30]

[Page 224.]

practically harmless, unless our own thought barbs it. [1]
It is our pride that makes another's criticism rankle, our
self-will that makes another's deed offensive, our egotism
that feels hurt by another's self-assertion. Well may we
feel wounded by our own faults; but we can hardly afford [5]
to be miserable for the faults of others.

A courtier told Constantine that a mob had broken
the head of his statue with stones. The emperor lifted
his hands to his head, saying: "It is very surprising, but
I don't feel hurt in the least." [10]

We should remember that the world is wide; that there
are a thousand million different human wills, opinions,
ambitions, tastes, and loves; that each person has a differ-
ent history, constitution, culture, character, from all the
rest; that human life is the work, the play, the ceaseless [15]
action and reaction upon each other of these different
atoms. Then, we should go forth into life with the smallest
expectations, but with the largest patience; with a keen
relish for and appreciation of everything beautiful, great,
and good, but with a temper so genial that the friction [20]
of the world shall not wear upon our sensibilities; with
an equanimity so settled that no passing breath nor
accidental disturbance shall agitate or ruffle it; with a
charity broad enough to cover the whole world's evil, and
sweet enough to neutralize what is bitter in it,--de- [25]
termined not to be offended when no wrong is meant, nor
even when it is, unless the offense be against God.

Nothing short of our own errors should offend us. He
who can wilfully attempt to injure another, is an object
of pity rather than of resentment; while it is a question [30]
in my mind, whether there is enough of a flatterer, a fool,
or a liar, _to_ offend a whole-souled woman.

[Page 225.]




Hints To The Clergy


At the residence of Mr. Rawson, of Arlington, Massa-
chusetts, a happy concourse of friends had gathered to
celebrate the eighty-second birthday of his mother--a
friend of mine, and a Christian Scientist. [5]

Among the guests, were an orthodox clergyman, his
wife and child.

In the course of the evening, conversation drifted to
the seventh modern wonder, Christian Science; where-
upon the mother, Mrs. Rawson, who had drunk at its [10]
fount, firmly bore testimony to the power of Christ, Truth,
to heal the sick.

Soon after this conversation, the clergyman's son
was taken violently ill. Then was the clergyman's
opportunity to demand a proof of what the Christian [15]
Scientist had declared; and he said to this venerable
Christian:--

"If you heal my son, when seeing, I may be led to
believe."

Mrs. Rawson then rose from her seat, and sat down [20]
beside the sofa whereon lay the lad with burning brow,
moaning in pain.

Looking away from all material aid, to the spiritual
source and ever-present help, silently, through the divine
power, she healed him. [25]

The deep flush faded from the face, a cool perspiration
spread over it, and he slept.

In about one hour he awoke, and was hungry.

The parents said:--

"Wait until we get home, and you shall have some [30]
gruel."

[Page 226.]

But Mrs. Rawson said:--[1]

"Give the child what he relishes, and doubt not that
the Father of all will care for him."

Thus, the unbiased youth and the aged Christian
carried the case on the side of God; and, after eating [5]
several ice-creams, the clergyman's son returned home
--_well_.




Perfidy And Slander


What has an individual gained by losing his own self-
respect? or what has he lost when, retaining his own, [10]
he loses the homage of fools, or the pretentious praise of
hypocrites, false to themselves as to others?

Shakespeare, the immortal lexicographer of mortals,
writes:--


                   To thine own self be true, [15]
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.


When Aristotle was asked what a person could gain
by uttering a falsehood, he replied, "Not to be credited
when he shall tell the truth." [20]

The character of a liar and hypocrite is so contempti-
ble, that even of those who have lost their honor it might
be expected that from the violation of truth they should
be restrained by their pride.

Perfidy of an inferior quality, such as manages to evade [25]
the law, and which dignified natures cannot stoop to
notice, except legally, disgraces human nature more than
do most vices.

Slander is a midnight robber; the red-tongued assas-
sin of radical worth; the conservative swindler, who [30]

[Page 227.]

sells himself in a traffic by which he can gain nothing [1].
It can retire for forgiveness to no fraternity where its
crime may stand in the place of a virtue; but must at
length be given up to the hisses of the multitude, with-
out friend and without apologist. [5]

Law has found it necessary to offer to the innocent,
security from slanderers--those pests of society--when
their crime comes within its jurisdiction. Thus, to evade
the penalty of law, and yet with malice aforethought to
extend their evil intent, is the nice distinction by which [10]
they endeavor to get their weighty stuff into the hands
of gossip! Some uncharitable one may give it a forward
move, and, ere that one himself become aware, find
himself responsible for kind (?) endeavors.

Would that my pen or pity could raise these weak, [15]
pitifully poor objects from their choice of self-degrada-
tion to the nobler purposes and wider aims of a life made
honest: a life in which the fresh flowers of feeling blos-
som, and, like the camomile, the more trampled upon,
the sweeter the odor they send forth to benefit mankind; [20]
a life wherein calm, self-respected thoughts abide in
tabernacles of their own, dwelling upon a holy hill, speak-
ing the truth in the heart; a life wherein the mind can
rest in green pastures, beside the still waters, on isles
of sweet refreshment. The sublime summary of an [25]
honest life satisfies the mind craving a higher good, and
bathes it in the cool waters of peace on earth; till it
grows into the full stature of wisdom, reckoning its
own by the amount of happiness it has bestowed upon
others. [30]

Not to avenge one's self upon one's enemies, is the
command of almighty wisdom; and we take this to be

[Page 228.]

a safer guide than the promptings of human nature. [1]
To know that a deception dark as it is base has been
practised upon thee,--by those deemed at least indebted
friends whose welfare thou hast promoted,--and yet
not to avenge thyself, is to do good to thyself; is to take [5]
a new standpoint whence to look upward; is to be calm
amid excitement, just amid lawlessness, and pure amid
corruption.

To be a great man or woman, to have a name whose
odor fills the world with its fragrance, is to bear with [10]
patience the buffetings of envy or malice--even while
seeking to raise those barren natures to a capacity for a
higher life. We should look with pitying eye on the
momentary success of all villainies, on mad ambition
and low revenge. This will bring us also to look on a [15]
kind, true, and just person, faithful to conscience and
honest beyond reproach, as the only suitable fabric out
of which to weave an existence fit for earth and
heaven.




Contagion


Whatever man sees, feels, or in any way takes cog-
nizance of, must be caught through mind; inasmuch
as perception, sensation, and consciousness belong to
mind and not to matter. Floating with the popular
current of mortal thought without questioning the re- [25]
liability of its conclusions, we do what others do,
believe what others believe, and say what others say.
Common consent is contagious, and it makes disease
catching.

People believe in infectious and contagious diseases, [30]

[Page 229.]

and that any one is liable to have them under certain [1]
predisposing or exciting causes. This mental state pre-
pares one to have any disease whenever there appear the
circumstances which he believes produce it. If he believed
as sincerely that health is catching when exposed to con- [5]
tact with healthy people, he would catch their state of
feeling quite as surely and with better effect than he does
the sick man's.

If only the people would believe that good is more
contagious than evil, since God is omnipresence, how [10]
much more certain would be the doctor's success, and
the clergyman's conversion of sinners. And if only the
pulpit would encourage faith in God in this direction,
and faith in Mind over all other influences governing
the receptivity of the body, theology would teach man [15]
as David taught: "Because thou hast made the Lord,
which is my refuge, even the most High thy habitation;
there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague
come nigh thy dwelling."

The confidence of mankind in contagious disease would [20]
thus become beautifully less; and in the same propor-
tion would faith in the power of God to heal and to save
mankind increase, until the whole human race would
become healthier, holier, happier, and longer lived. A
calm, Christian state of mind is a better preventive of [25]
contagion than a drug, or than any other possible sana-
tive method; and the "perfect Love" that "casteth out
fear" is a sure defense.

[Page 230.]




Improve Your Time


Success in life depends upon persistent effort, upon [1]
the improvement of moments more than upon any other
one thing. A great amount of time is consumed in talking
nothing, doing nothing, and indecision as to what one
should do. If one would be successful in the future, let [5]
him make the most of the present.

Three ways of wasting time, one of which is con-
temptible, are gossiping mischief, making lingering calls,
and mere motion when at work, thinking of nothing or [10]
planning for some amusement,--travel of limb more
than mind. Rushing around smartly is no proof of ac-
complishing much.

All successful individuals have become such by hard
work; by improving moments before they pass into hours, [15]
and hours that other people may occupy in the pursuit
of pleasure. They spend no time in sheer idleness, in
talking when they have nothing to say, in building air-
castles or floating off on the wings of sense: all of which
drop human life into the ditch of nonsense, and worse [20]
than waste its years.


    "Let us, then, be up and doing,
      With a heart for any fate;
    Still achieving, still pursuing,
      Learn to labor and to wait." [25]




Thanksgiving Dinner


It was a beautiful group! needing but canvas and the
touch of an artist to render it pathetic, tender, gorgeous.

[Page 231.]

Age, on whose hoary head the almond-blossom formed a [1]
crown of glory; middle age, in smiles and the full fruition
of happiness; infancy, exuberant with joy,--ranged side
by side. The sober-suited grandmother, rich in ex-
perience, had seen sunshine and shadow fall upon ninety- [5]
six years. Four generations sat at that dinner-table.
The rich viands made busy many appetites; but, what
of the poor! Willingly--though I take no stock in
spirit-rappings--would I have had the table give a
spiritual groan for the unfeasted ones. [10]

Under the skilful carving of the generous host, the
mammoth turkey grew beautifully less. His was the
glory to vie with guests in the dexterous use of knife and
fork, until delicious pie, pudding, and fruit caused un-
conditional surrender. [15]

And the baby! Why, he made a big hole, with two
incisors, in a big pippin, and bit the finger presump-
tuously poked into the little mouth to arrest the peel!
Then he was caught walking! one, two, three steps,--
and papa knew that he could walk, but grandpa was [20]
taken napping. Now! baby has tumbled, soft as thistle-
down, on the floor; and instead of a real set-to at crying,
a look of cheer and a toy from mamma bring the soft
little palms patting together, and pucker the rosebud
mouth into saying, "Oh, pretty!" That was a scientific [25]
baby; and his first sitting-at-table on Thanksgiving Day--
yes, and his little rainbowy life--brought sunshine
to every heart. How many homes echo such tones of
heartfelt joy on Thanksgiving Day! But, alas! for the
desolate home; for the tear-filled eyes looking longingly [30]
at the portal through which the loved one comes not, or
gazing silently on the vacant seat at fireside and board--

[Page 232.]

God comfort them all! we inwardly prayed--but the [1]
memory was too much; and, turning from it, in a bumper
of pudding-sauce we drank to peace, and plenty, and
happy households.




Christian Science


This age is reaching out towards the perfect Principle
of things; is pushing towards perfection in art, inven-
tion, and manufacture. Why, then, should religion be
stereotyped, and we not obtain a more perfect and prac-
tical Christianity? It will never do to be behind the [10]
times in things most essential, which proceed from the
