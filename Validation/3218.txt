BLACKY THE CROW

By Thornton W. Burgess



CHAPTER I: Blacky The Crow Makes A Discovery

Blacky the Crow is always watching for things not intended for his sharp
eyes. The result is that he gets into no end of trouble which he could
avoid. In this respect he is just like his cousin, Sammy Jay. Between
them they see a great deal with which they have no business and which it
would be better for them not to see.

Now Blacky the Crow finds it no easy matter to pick up a living when
snow covers the Green Meadows and the Green Forest, and ice binds the
Big River and the Smiling Pool. He has to use his sharp eyes for all
they are worth in order to find enough to fill his stomach, and he will
eat anything in the way of food that he can swallow. Often he travels
long distances looking for food, but at night he always comes back to
the same place in the Green Forest, to sleep in company with others of
his family.

Blacky dearly loves company, particularly at night, and about the time
jolly, round, red Mr. Sun is beginning to think about his bed behind
the Purple Hills, you will find Blacky heading for a certain part of
the Green Forest where he knows he will have neighbors of his own kind.
Peter Rabbit says that it is because Blacky's conscience troubles him
so that he doesn't dare sleep alone, but Happy Jack Squirrel says that
Blacky hasn't any conscience. You can believe just which you please,
though I suspect that neither of them really knows.

As I have said, Blacky is quite a traveler at this time of year, and
sometimes his search for food takes him to out-of-the-way places. One
day toward the very last of winter, the notion entered his black head
that he would have a look in a certain lonesome corner of the Green
Forest where once upon a time Redtail the Hawk had lived. Blacky knew
well enough that Redtail wasn't there now; he had gone south in the fell
and wouldn't be back until he was sure that Mistress Spring had arrived
on the Green Meadows and in the Green Forest.

Like the black imp he is, Blacky flew over the tree-tops, his sharp eyes
watching for something interesting below. Presently he saw ahead of him
the old nest of Red-tail. He knew all about that nest. He had visited
it before when Red-tail was away. Still it might be worth another visit.
You never can tell what you may find in old houses. Now, of course,
Blacky knew perfectly well that Redtail was miles and miles, hundreds
of miles away, and so there was nothing to fear from him. But Blacky
learned ever so long ago that there is nothing like making sure that
there is no danger. So, instead of flying straight to that old nest, he
first flew over the tree so that he could look down into it.

Right away he saw something that made him gasp and blink his eyes. It
was quite large and white, and it looked--it looked very much indeed
like an egg! Do you wonder that Blacky gasped and blinked? Here was snow
on the ground, and Rough Brother North Wind and Jack Frost had given no
hint that they were even thinking of going back to the Far North. The
idea of any one laying an egg at this time of year! Blacky flew over to
a tall pine-tree to think it over.

"Must be it was a little lump of snow," thought he. "Yet if ever I saw
an egg, that looked like one. Jumping grasshoppers, how good an egg
would taste right now!" You know Blacky has a weakness for eggs. The
more he thought about it, the hungrier he grew. Several times he almost
made up his mind to fly straight over there and make sure, but he didn't
quite dare. If it were an egg, it must belong to somebody, and perhaps
it would be best to find out who. Suddenly Blacky shook himself. "I must
be dreaming," said he. "There couldn't, there just couldn't be an egg at
this time of year, or in that old tumble-down nest! I'll just fly away
and forget it."

So he flew away, but he couldn't forget it. He kept thinking of it all
day, and when he went to sleep that night he made up his mind to have
another look at that old nest.



CHAPTER II: Blacky Makes Sure

   "As true as ever I've cawed a caw
    That was a new-laid egg I saw."

"What are you talking about?" demanded Sammy Jay, coming up just in time
to hear the last part of what Blacky the Crow was mumbling to himself.

"Oh nothing, Cousin, nothing at all," replied Blacky. "I was just
talking foolishness to myself." Sammy looked at him sharply. "You aren't
feeling sick, are you, Cousin Blacky?" he asked. "Must be something
the matter with you when you begin talking about new-laid eggs, when
everything's covered with snow and ice. Foolishness is no name for it.
Whoever heard of such a thing as a new-laid egg this time of year."

"Nobody, I guess," replied Blacky. "I told you I was just talking
foolishness. You see, I'm so hungry that I just got to thinking what I'd
have if I could have anything I wanted. That made me think of eggs, and
I tried to think just how I would feel if I should suddenly see a great
big egg right in front of me. I guess I must have said something about
it."

"I guess you must have. It isn't egg time yet, and it won't be for a
long time. Take my advice and just forget about impossible things. I'm
going over to Farmer Brown's corncrib. Corn may not be as good as eggs,
but it is very good and very filling. Better come along," said Sammy.

"Not this morning, thank you. Some other time, perhaps," replied
Blacky.

He watched Sammy disappear through the trees. Then he flew to the top
of the tallest pine-tree to make sure that no one was about. When he was
quite sure that no one was watching him, he spread his wings and headed
for the most lonesome corner of the Green Forest.

"I'm foolish. I know I'm foolish," he muttered. "But I've just got to
have another look in that old nest of Redtail the Hawk. I just can't get
it out of my head that that was an egg, a great, big, white egg, that I
saw there yesterday. It won't do any harm to have another look, anyway."

Straight toward the tree in which was the great tumble-down nest of
Redtail the Hawk he flew, and as he drew near, he flew high, for Blacky
is too shrewd and smart to take any chances. Not that he thought that
there could be any danger there; but you never can tell, and it is
always the part of wisdom to be on the safe side. As he passed over the
top of the tree, he looked down eagerly. Just imagine how he felt when
instead of one, he saw two white things in the old nest--two white
things that looked for all the world like eggs! The day before there had
been but one; now there were two. That settled it in Blacky's mind; they
were eggs! They couldn't be anything else.

Blacky kept right on flying. Somehow he didn't dare stop just then. He
was too much excited by what he had discovered to think clearly. He had
got to have time to get his wits together. Whoever had laid those eggs
was big and strong. He felt sure of that. It must be some one a great
deal bigger than himself, and he was of no mind to get into trouble,
even for a dinner of fresh eggs. He must first find out whose they were;
then he would know better what to do. He felt sure that no one else knew
about them, and he knew that they couldn't run away. So he kept right on
flying until he reached a certain tall pine-tree where he could sit and
think without being disturbed.

"Eggs!" he muttered. "Real eggs! Now who under the sun can have moved
into Redtail's old house? And what can they mean by laying eggs before
Mistress Spring has even sent word that she has started? It's too much
for me. It certainly is too much for me."



CHAPTER III: Blacky Finds Out Who Owns The Eggs

Two big white eggs in a tumbledown nest, and snow and ice everywhere!
Did ever anybody hear of such a thing before?

"Wouldn't believe it, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes," muttered
Blacky the Crow. "Have to believe them. If I can't believe them, it's of
no use to try to believe anything in this world. As sure as I sit here,
that old nest has two eggs in it. Whoever laid them must be crazy to
start housekeeping at this time of year. I must find out whose eggs they
are and then--"

Blacky didn't finish, but there was a hungry look in his eyes that would
have told any who saw it, had there been any to see it, that he had
a use for those eggs. But there was none to see it, and he took the
greatest care that there should be none to see him when he once again
started for a certain lonesome corner of the Green Forest.

"First I'll make sure that the eggs are still there," thought he, and
flew high above the tree tops, so that as he passed over the tree in
which was the old nest of Red-tail the Hawk, he might look down into it.
To have seen him, you would never have guessed that he was looking for
anything in particular. He seemed to be just flying over on his way to
some distant place. If the eggs were still there, he meant to come back
and hide in the top of a near-by pine-tree to watch until he was sure
that he might safely steal those eggs, or to find out whose they were.

Blacky's heart beat fast with excitement as he drew near that old
tumble-down nest. Would those two big white eggs be there? Perhaps
there would be three! The very thought made him flap his wings a little
faster. A few more wing strokes and he would be right over the tree. How
he did hope to see those eggs! He could almost see into the nest now.
One stroke! Two strokes! Three strokes! Blacky bit his tongue to keep
from giving a sharp caw of disappointment and surprise.

There were no eggs to be seen. No, Sir, there wasn't a sign of eggs in
that old nest. There wasn't because--why, do you think? There wasn't
because Blacky looked straight down on a great mass of feathers which
quite covered them from sight, and he didn't have to look twice to know
that that great mass of feathers was really a great bird, the bird to
whom those eggs belonged.

Blacky didn't turn to come back as he had planned. He kept right on,
just as if he hadn't seen anything, and as he flew he shivered a little.
He shivered at the thought of what might have happened to him if he had
tried to steal those eggs the day before and had been caught doing it.

"I'm thankful I knew enough to leave them alone," said he. "Funny I
never once guessed whose eggs they are. I might have known that no one
but Hooty the Horned Owl would think of nesting at this time of year.
And that was Mrs. Hooty I saw on the nest just now. My, but she's big!
She's bigger than Hooty himself! Yes, Sir, it's a lucky thing I didn't
try to get those eggs yesterday. Probably both Hooty and Mrs. Hooty were
sitting close by, only they were sitting so still that I thought they
were parts of the tree they were in. Blacky, Blacky, the sooner you
forget those eggs the better."

Some things are best forgotten As soon as they are learned. Who never
plays with fire Will surely not get burned.



CHAPTER IV: The Cunning Of Blacky

Now when Blacky the Crow discovered that the eggs in the old tumble-down
nest of Redtail the Hawk in a lonesome corner of the Green Forest
belonged to Hooty the Owl, he straightway made the best of resolutions;
he would simply forget all about those eggs. He would forget that he
ever had seen them, and he would stay away from that corner of the Green
Forest. That was a very wise resolution. Of all the people who live in
the Green Forest, none is fiercer or more savage than Hooty the Owl,
unless it is Mrs. Hooty. She is bigger than Hooty and certainly quite as
much to be feared by the little people.

All this Blacky knows. No one knows it better. And Blacky is not one
to poke his head into trouble with his eyes open. So he very wisely
resolved to forget all about those eggs. Now it is one thing to make a
resolution and quite another thing to live up to it, as you all know.
It was easy enough to say that he would forget, but not at all easy
to forget. It would have been different if it had been spring or early
summer, when there were plenty of other eggs to be had by any one smart
enough to find them and steal them. But now, when it was still winter
(such an unheard-of time for any one to have eggs!), and it was hard
work to find enough to keep a hungry Crow's stomach filled, the thought
of those eggs would keep popping into his head. He just couldn't seem to
forget them. After a little, he didn't try.

Now Blacky the Crow is very, very cunning. He is one of the smartest
