OTHER WORLDS.

     Their Nature and Possibilities in the Light of the Latest
     Discoveries. Illustrated. 12mo. Cloth, $1.20 net; postage
     additional.

     No science has ever equaled astronomy in its appeal to the
     imagination, and recently popular interest in the wonders of the
     starry heavens has been stimulated by surprising discoveries and
     imaginary discoveries, as well as by a marked tendency of writers
     of fiction to include other worlds and their possible inhabitants
     within the field of romance.

     Mr. Serviss's new book on "Other Worlds, their Nature and
     Possibilities in the Light of the Latest Discoveries," summarizes
     what is known. With helpful illustrations, the most interesting
     facts about the planets Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc., as well
     as about the nearest of all other worlds, the moon, are presented
     in a popular manner, and always from the point of view of human
     interest--a point that is too seldom taken by writers on science.

PREFACE


The point of view of this book is human interest in the other worlds
around us. It presents the latest discoveries among the planets of the
solar system, and shows their bearing upon the question of life in those
planets. It points out the resemblances and the differences between the
earth and the other worlds that share with it in the light of the sun.
It shows what we should see and experience if we could visit those
worlds.

While basing itself upon facts, it does not exclude the discussion of
interesting probabilities and theories that have commanded wide popular
attention. It points out, for instance, what is to be thought of the
idea of interplanetary communication. It indicates what must be the
outlook of the possible inhabitants of some of the other planets toward
the earth. As far as may be, it traces the origin and development of the
other worlds of our system, and presents a graphic picture of their
present condition as individuals, and of their wonderful contrasts as
members of a common family.

In short, the aim of the author has been to show how wide, and how rich,
is the field of interest opened to the human mind by man's discoveries
concerning worlds, which, though inaccessible to him in a physical
sense, offer intellectual conquests of the noblest description.

And, finally, in order to assist those who may wish to recognize for
themselves these other worlds in the sky, this book presents a special
series of charts to illustrate a method of finding the planets which
requires no observatory and no instruments, and only such knowledge of
the starry heavens as anybody can easily acquire.
