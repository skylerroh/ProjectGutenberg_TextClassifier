lucklessly entrained to intercept the provision, and divert it to
the garrison of Martino di Porto. This news somewhat increased his
consternation, for the boy belonged to a family that claimed the
patronage of the Colonna.

Anxiously and tearfully he looked with every moment up the steep ascent
of the Aventine; but his guardian, his protector, still delayed his
appearance.

They had now proceeded some way, when a winding in the road brought
suddenly before them the object of their pursuit, as, seen by the light
of the earliest stars, it scudded rapidly down the stream.

"Now, the Saints be blest!" quoth the chief; "she is ours!"

"Hold!" said a captain (a German) riding next to Martino, in a half
whisper; "I hear sounds which I like not, by yonder trees--hark! The
neigh of a horse!--by my faith, too, there is the gleam of a corselet."

"Push on, my masters," cried Martino; "the heron shall not balk the
eagle--push on!"

With renewed shouts, those on foot pushed forward, till, as they had
nearly gained the copse referred to by the German, a small compact body
of horsemen, armed cap-a-pie, dashed from amidst the trees, and, with
spears in their rests, charged into the ranks of the pursuers.

"A Colonna! a Colonna!" "An Orsini! an Orsini!" were shouts loudly
and fiercely interchanged. Martino di Porto, a man of great bulk and
ferocity, and his cavaliers, who were chiefly German Mercenaries, met
the encounter unshaken. "Beware the bear's hug," cried the Orsini, as
down went his antagonist, rider and steed, before his lance.

The contest was short and fierce; the complete armour of the horsemen
protected them on either side from wounds,--not so unscathed fared the
half-armed foot-followers of the Orsini, as they pressed, each pushed on
by the other, against the Colonna. After a shower of stones and darts,
which fell but as hailstones against the thick mail of the horsemen,
they closed in, and, by their number, obstructed the movements of the
steeds, while the spear, sword, and battle-axe of their opponents made
ruthless havoc amongst their undisciplined ranks. And Martino, who cared
little how many of his mere mob were butchered, seeing that his foes
were for the moment embarrassed by the wild rush and gathering circle
of his foot train (for the place of conflict, though wider than the
previous road, was confined and narrow), made a sign to some of his
horsemen, and was about to ride forward towards the boat, now nearly out
of sight, when a bugle at some distance was answered by one of his enemy
at hand; and the shout of "Colonna to the rescue!" was echoed afar off.
A few moments brought in view a numerous train of horse at full speed,
with the banners of the Colonna waving gallantly in the front.

"A plague on the wizards! who would have imagined they had divined us
so craftily!" muttered Martino; "we must not abide these odds;" and the
hand he had first raised for advance, now gave the signal of retreat.

Serried breast to breast and in complete order, the horsemen of Martino
turned to fly; the foot rabble who had come for spoil remained but for
slaughter. They endeavoured to imitate their leaders; but how could they
all elude the rushing chargers and sharp lances of their antagonists,
whose blood was heated by the affray, and who regarded the lives at
their mercy as a boy regards the wasp's nest he destroys. The crowd
dispersing in all directions,--some, indeed, escaped up the hills, where
the footing was impracticable to the horses; some plunged into the river
and swam across to the opposite bank--those less cool or experienced,
who fled right onwards, served, by clogging the way of their enemy, to
facilitate the flight of their leaders, but fell themselves, corpse upon
corpse, butchered in the unrelenting and unresisted pursuit.

"No quarter to the ruffians--every Orsini slain is a robber the
less--strike for God, the Emperor, and the Colonna!" such were the
shouts which rung the knell of the dismayed and falling fugitives. Among
those who fled onward, in the very path most accessible to the cavalry,
was the young brother of Cola, so innocently mixed with the affray. Fast
he fled, dizzy with terror--poor boy, scarce before ever parted from his
parents' or his brother's side!--the trees glided past him--the banks
receded:--on he sped, and fast behind came the tramp of the hoofs--the
shouts--the curses--the fierce laughter of the foe, as they bounded over
the dead and the dying in their path. He was now at the spot in which
his brother had left him; hastily he glanced behind, and saw the couched
lance and horrent crest of the horseman close at his rear; despairingly
he looked up, and behold! his brother bursting through the tangled
brakes that clothed the mountain, and bounding to his succour.

"Save me! save me, brother!" he shrieked aloud, and the shriek reached
Cola's ear;--the snort of the fiery charger breathed hot upon him;--a
moment more, and with one wild shrill cry of "Mercy, mercy" he fell
to the ground--a corpse: the lance of the pursuer passing through and
through him, from back to breast, and nailing him on the very sod where
he had sate, full of young life and careless hope, not an hour ago.

The horseman plucked forth his spear, and passed on in pursuit of
new victims; his comrades following. Cola had descended,--was on the
spot,--kneeling by his murdered brother. Presently, to the sound of
horn and trumpet, came by a nobler company than most of those hitherto
engaged; who had been, indeed, but the advanced-guard of the Colonna. At
their head rode a man in years, whose long white hair escaped from his
plumed cap and mingled with his venerable beard. "How is this?" said the
chief, reining in his steed, "young Rienzi!"

The youth looked up, as he heard that voice, and then flung himself
before the steed of the old noble, and, clasping his hands, cried out
in a scarce articulate tone: "It is my brother, noble Stephen,--a boy,
a mere child!--the best--the mildest! See how his blood dabbles the
grass;--back, back--your horse's hoofs are in the stream! Justice, my
Lord, justice!--you are a great man."

"Who slew him? an Orsini, doubtless; you shall have justice."

"Thanks, thanks," murmured Rienzi, as he tottered once more to his
brother's side, turned the boy's face from the grass, and strove wildly
to feel the pulse of his heart; he drew back his hand hastily, for it
was crimsoned with blood, and lifting that hand on high, shrieked out
again, "Justice! justice!"

The group round the old Stephen Colonna, hardened as they were in such
scenes, were affected by the sight. A handsome boy, whose tears ran
fast down his cheeks, and who rode his palfrey close by the side of the
Colonna, drew forth his sword. "My Lord," said he, half sobbing, "an
Orsini only could have butchered a harmless lad like this; let us lose
not a moment,--let us on after the ruffians."

"No, Adrian, no!" cried Stephen, laying his hand on the boy's shoulder;
"your zeal is to be lauded, but we must beware an ambush. Our men have
ventured too far--what, ho, there!--sound a return."

The bugles, in a few minutes, brought back the pursuers,--among them,
the horseman whose spear had been so fatally misused. He was the leader
of those engaged in the conflict with Martino di Porto; and the gold
wrought into his armour, with the gorgeous trappings of his charger,
betokened his rank.

"Thanks, my son, thanks," said the old Colonna to this cavalier, "you
have done well and bravely. But tell me, knowest thou, for thou hast
an eagle eye, which of the Orsini slew this poor boy?--a foul deed; his
family, too, our clients!"

"Who? yon lad?" replied the horseman, lifting the helmet from his
head, and wiping his heated brow; "say you so! how came he, then, with
Martino's rascals? I fear me the mistake hath cost him dear. I could but
suppose him of the Orsini rabble, and so--and so--"

"You slew him!" cried Rienzi, in a voice of thunder, starting from
the ground. "Justice! then, my Lord Stephen, justice! you promised me
justice, and I will have it!"

"My poor youth," said the old man, compassionately, "you should have had
justice against the Orsini; but see you not this has been an error? I
do not wonder you are too grieved to listen to reason now. We must make
this up to you."

"And let this pay for masses for the boy's soul; I grieve me much for
the accident," said the younger Colonna, flinging down a purse of gold.
"Ay, see us at the palace next week, young Cola--next week. My father,
we had best return towards the boat; its safeguard may require us yet."

"Right, Gianni; stay, some two of you, and see to the poor lad's
corpse;--a grievous accident! how could it chance?"

The company passed back the way they came, two of the common soldiers
alone remaining, except the boy Adrian, who lingered behind a few
moments, striving to console Rienzi, who, as one bereft of sense,
remained motionless, gazing on the proud array as it swept along, and
muttering to himself, "Justice, justice! I will have it yet."

The loud voice of the elder Colonna summoned Adrian, reluctantly
and weeping, away. "Let me be your brother," said the gallant boy,
affectionately pressing the scholar's hand to his heart; "I want a
brother like you."

Rienzi made no reply; he did not heed or hear him--dark and stern
thoughts, thoughts in which were the germ of a mighty revolution, were
at his heart. He woke from them with a start, as the soldiers were now
arranging their bucklers so as to make a kind of bier for the corpse,
and then burst into tears as he fiercely motioned them away, and clasped
the clay to his breast till he was literally soaked with the oozing
blood.

The poor child's garland had not dropped from his arm even when he fell,
and, entangled by his dress, it still clung around him. It was a sight
that recalled to Cola all the gentleness, the kind heart, and winning
graces of his only brother--his only friend! It was a sight that
seemed to make yet more inhuman the untimely and unmerited fate of that
innocent boy. "My brother! my brother!" groaned the survivor; "how shall
I meet our mother?--how shall I meet even night and solitude again?--so
young, so harmless! See ye, sirs, he was but too gentle. And they will
not give us justice, because his murderer was a noble and a Colonna.
And this gold, too--gold for a brother's blood! Will they not"--and the
young man's eyes glared like fire--"will they not give us justice?
Time shall show!" so saying, he bent his head over the corpse; his lips
muttered, as with some prayer or invocation; and then rising, his face
was as pale as the dead beside him,--but it was no longer pale with
grief!

From that bloody clay, and that inward prayer, Cola di Rienzi rose a new
being. With his young brother died his own youth. But for that event,
the future liberator of Rome might have been but a dreamer, a scholar, a
poet; the peaceful rival of Petrarch; a man of thoughts, not deeds. But
from that time, all his faculties, energies, fancies, genius, became
concentrated into a single point; and patriotism, before a vision, leapt
into the life and vigour of a passion, lastingly kindled, stubbornly
hardened, and awfully consecrated,--by revenge!



Chapter 1.II. An Historical Survey--not to Be Passed Over, Except by
Those Who Dislike to Understand What They Read.

Years had passed away, and the death of the Roman boy, amidst more noble
and less excusable slaughter, was soon forgotten,--forgotten almost
by the parents of the slain, in the growing fame and fortunes of their
eldest son,--forgotten and forgiven never by that son himself.
But, between that prologue of blood, and the political drama which
ensues,--between the fading interest, as it were, of a dream, and the
more busy, actual, and continuous excitements of sterner life,--this may
be the most fitting time to place before the reader a short and rapid
outline of the state and circumstances of that city in which the
principal scenes of this story are laid;--an outline necessary, perhaps,
to many, for a full comprehension of the motives of the actors, and the
vicissitudes of the plot.

Despite the miscellaneous and mongrel tribes that had forced their
settlements in the City of the Caesars, the Roman population retained
an inordinate notion of their own supremacy over the rest of the world;
and, degenerated from the iron virtues of the Republic, possessed all
the insolent and unruly turbulence which characterised the Plebs of the
ancient Forum. Amongst a ferocious, yet not a brave populace, the
nobles supported themselves less as sagacious tyrants than as relentless
banditti. The popes had struggled in vain against these stubborn and
stern patricians. Their state derided, their command defied, their
persons publicly outraged, the pontiff-sovereigns of the rest of Europe
resided, at the Vatican, as prisoners under terror of execution.
When, thirty-eight years before the date of the events we are about to
witness, a Frenchman, under the name of Clement V., had ascended the
chair of St. Peter, the new pope, with more prudence than valour, had
deserted Rome for the tranquil retreat of Avignon; and the luxurious
town of a foreign province became the court of the Roman pontiff, and
the throne of the Christian Church.

Thus deprived of even the nominal check of the papal presence, the power
of the nobles might be said to have no limits, save their own caprice,
or their mutual jealousies and feuds. Though arrogating through fabulous
genealogies their descent from the ancient Romans, they were, in
reality, for the most part, the sons of the bolder barbarians of the
North; and, contaminated by the craft of Italy, rather than imbued with
its national affections, they retained the disdain of their foreign
ancestors for a conquered soil and a degenerate people. While the rest
of Italy, especially in Florence, in Venice, and in Milan, was fast and
far advancing beyond the other states of Europe in civilisation and in
art, the Romans appeared rather to recede than to improve;--unblest by
laws, unvisited by art, strangers at once to the chivalry of a warlike,
and the graces of a peaceful, people. But they still possessed the
sense and desire of liberty, and, by ferocious paroxysms and desperate
struggles, sought to vindicate for their city the title it still assumed
of "the Metropolis of the World." For the last two centuries they had
known various revolutions--brief, often bloody, and always unsuccessful.
Still, there was the empty pageant of a popular form of government. The
thirteen quarters of the city named each a chief; and the assembly of
these magistrates, called Caporioni, by theory possessed an authority
they had neither the power nor the courage to exert. Still there was the
proud name of Senator; but, at the present time, the office was confined
to one or to two persons, sometimes elected by the pope, sometimes by
the nobles. The authority attached to the name seems to have had no
definite limit; it was that of a stern dictator, or an indolent puppet,
according as he who held it had the power to enforce the dignity he
assumed. It was never conceded but to nobles, and it was by the nobles
that all the outrages were committed. Private enmity alone was gratified
whenever public justice was invoked: and the vindication of order was
but the execution of revenge.

Holding their palaces as the castles and fortresses of princes, each
asserting his own independency of all authority and law, and planting
fortifications, and claiming principalities in the patrimonial
territories of the Church, the barons of Rome made their state still
more secure, and still more odious, by the maintenance of troops of
foreign (chiefly of German) mercenaries, at once braver in disposition,
more disciplined in service, and more skilful in arms, than even the
freest Italians of that time. Thus they united the judicial and the
military force, not for the protection, but for the ruin of Rome. Of
these barons, the most powerful were the Orsini and Colonna; their feuds
were hereditary and incessant, and every day witnessed the fruits of
their lawless warfare, in bloodshed, in rape, and in conflagration.
The flattery or the friendship of Petrarch, too credulously believed by
modern historians, has invested the Colonna, especially of the date now
entered upon, with an elegance and a dignity not their own. Outrage,
fraud, and assassination, a sordid avarice in securing lucrative offices
to themselves, an insolent oppression of their citizens, and the
most dastardly cringing to power superior to their own (with but few
exceptions), mark the character of the first family of Rome. But,
wealthier than the rest of the barons, they were, therefore, more
luxurious, and, perhaps, more intellectual; and their pride was
flattered in being patrons of those arts of which they could never
have become the professors. From these multiplied oppressors the Roman
citizens turned with fond and impatient regret to their ignorant and
dark notions of departed liberty and greatness. They confounded the
times of the Empire with those of the Republic; and often looked to the
Teutonic king, who obtained his election from beyond the Alps, but his
title of emperor from the Romans, as the deserter of his legitimate
trust and proper home; vainly imagining that, if both the Emperor and
the Pontiff fixed their residence in Rome, Liberty and Law would again
seek their natural shelter beneath the resuscitated majesty of the Roman
people.

The absence of the pope and the papal court served greatly to impoverish
the citizens; and they had suffered yet more visibly by the depredations
of hordes of robbers, numerous and unsparing, who infested Romagna,
obstructing all the public ways, and were, sometimes secretly,
sometimes, openly, protected by the barons, who often recruited their
banditti garrisons by banditti soldiers.

But besides the lesser and ignobler robbers, there had risen in Italy
a far more formidable description of freebooters. A German, who assumed
the lofty title of the Duke Werner, had, a few years prior to the period
we approach, enlisted and organised a considerable force, styled "The
Great Company," with which he besieged cities and invaded states,
without any object less shameless than that of pillage. His example was
soon imitated: numerous "Companies," similarly constituted, devastated
the distracted and divided land. They appeared, suddenly raised, as if
by magic, before the walls of a city, and demanded immense sums as the
purchase of peace. Neither tyrant nor common wealth maintained a force
sufficient to resist them; and if other northern mercenaries were
engaged to oppose them, it was only to recruit the standards of the
freebooters with deserters. Mercenary fought not mercenary--nor German,
German: and greater pay, and more unbridled rapine, made the tents of
the "Companies" far more attractive than the regulated stipends of a
city, or the dull fortress and impoverished coffers of a chief. Werner,
the most implacable and ferocious of all these adventurers, and who had
so openly gloried in his enormities as to wear upon his breast a silver
plate, engraved with the words, "Enemy to God, to Pity, and to Mercy,"
had not long since ravaged Romagna with fire and sword. But, whether
induced by money, or unable to control the fierce spirits he had
raised, he afterwards led the bulk of his company back to Germany. Small
detachments, however, remained, scattered throughout the land, waiting
only an able leader once more to re-unite them: amongst those who
appeared most fitted for that destiny was Walter de Montreal, a Knight
of St. John, and gentleman of Provence, whose valour and military genius
had already, though yet young, raised his name into dreaded celebrity;
and whose ambition, experience, and sagacity, relieved by certain
chivalric and noble qualities, were suited to enterprises far greater
and more important than the violent depredations of the atrocious
Werner. From these scourges, no state had suffered more grievously than
Rome. The patrimonial territories of the pope,--in part wrested from him
by petty tyrants, in part laid waste by these foreign robbers,--yielded
but a scanty supply to the necessities of Clement VI., the most
accomplished gentleman and the most graceful voluptuary of his time; and
the good father had devised a plan, whereby to enrich at once the Romans
and their pontiff.

Nearly fifty years before the time we enter upon, in order both to
replenish the papal coffers and pacify the starving Romans, Boniface
VIII. had instituted the Festival of the Jubilee, or Holy Year; in fact,
a revival of a Pagan ceremonial. A plenary indulgence was promised
to every Catholic who, in that year, and in the first year of every
succeeding century, should visit the churches of St. Peter and St. Paul.
An immense concourse of pilgrims, from every part of Christendom, had
attested the wisdom of the invention; "and two priests stood night and
day, with rakes in their hands, to collect without counting the heaps
of gold and silver that were poured on the altar of St. Paul." (Gibbon,
vol. xii. c. 59.)

It is not to be wondered at that this most lucrative festival should,
ere the next century was half expired, appear to a discreet pontiff
to be too long postponed. And both pope and city agreed in thinking it
might well bear a less distant renewal. Accordingly, Clement VI. had
proclaimed, under the name of the Mosaic Jubilee, a second Holy Year
for 1350--viz., three years distant from that date at which, in the
next chapter, my narrative will commence. This circumstance had a great
effect in whetting the popular indignation against the barons, and
preparing the events I shall relate; for the roads were, as I before
said, infested by the banditti, the creatures and allies of the barons.
And if the roads were not cleared, the pilgrims might not attend. It
was the object of the pope's vicar, Raimond, bishop of Orvietto (bad
politician and good canonist), to seek, by every means, to remove all
impediment between the offerings of devotion and the treasury of St.
Peter.

Such, in brief, was the state of Rome at the period we are about to
examine. Her ancient mantle of renown still, in the eyes of Italy and of
Europe, cloaked her ruins. In name, at least, she was still the queen
of the earth; and from her hands came the crown of the emperor of the
north, and the keys of the father of the church. Her situation was
precisely that which presented a vase and glittering triumph to
bold ambition,--an inspiring, if mournful, spectacle to determined
patriotism,--and a fitting stage for that more august tragedy which
seeks its incidents, selects its actors, and shapes its moral, amidst
the vicissitudes and crimes of nations.



Chapter 1.III. The Brawl.

On an evening in April, 1347, and in one of those wide spaces in which
Modern and Ancient Rome seemed blent together--equally desolate and
equally in ruins--a miscellaneous and indignant populace were assembled.
That morning the house of a Roman jeweller had been forcibly entered and
pillaged by the soldiers of Martino di Porto, with a daring effrontery
which surpassed even the ordinary licence of the barons. The sympathy
and sensation throughout the city were deep and ominous.

"Never will I submit to this tyranny!"

"Nor I!"

"Nor I!"

"Nor by the bones of St. Peter, will I!"

"And what, my friends, is this tyranny to which you will not submit?"
said a young nobleman, addressing himself to the crowd of citizens who,
heated, angry, half-armed, and with the vehement gestures of Italian
passion, were now sweeping down the long and narrow street that led to
the gloomy quarter occupied by the Orsini.

"Ah, my lord!" cried two or three of the citizens in a breath, "you will
right us--you will see justice done to us--you are a Colonna."

"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed scornfully one man of gigantic frame, and wielding
on high a huge hammer, indicative of his trade. "Justice and Colonna!
body of God! those names are not often found together."

"Down with him! down with him! he is an Orsinist--down with him!" cried
at least ten of the throng: but no hand was raised against the giant.

"He speaks the truth," said a second voice, firmly.

"Ay, that doth he," said a third, knitting his brows, and unsheathing
his knife, "and we will abide by it. The Orsini are tyrants--and the
Colonnas are, at the best, as bad."

"Thou liest in thy teeth, ruffian!" cried the young noble, advancing
into the press and confronting the last asperser of the Colonna.

Before the flashing eye and menacing gesture of the cavalier, the worthy
brawler retreated some steps, so as to leave an open space between the
towering form of the smith, and the small, slender, but vigorous frame
of the young noble.

Taught from their birth to despise the courage of the plebeians, even
while careless of much reputation as to their own, the patricians of
Rome were not unaccustomed to the rude fellowship of these brawls; nor
was it unoften that the mere presence of a noble sufficed to scatter
whole crowds, that had the moment before been breathing vengeance
against his order and his house.

Waving his hand, therefore, to the smith, and utterly unheeding either
his brandished weapon or his vast stature, the young Adrian di Castello,
a distant kinsman of the Colonna, haughtily bade him give way.

"To your homes, friends! and know," he added, with some dignity, "that
ye wrong us much, if ye imagine we share the evil-doings of the Orsini,
or are pandering solely to our own passions in the feud between their
house and ours. May the Holy Mother so judge me," continued he, devoutly
lifting up his eyes, "as I now with truth declare, that it is for your
wrongs, and for the wrongs of Rome, that I have drawn this sword against
the Orsini."

"So say all the tyrants," rejoined the smith, hardily, as he leant his
hammer against a fragment of stone--some remnant of ancient Rome--"they
never fight against each other, but it is for our good. One Colonna cuts
me the throat of Orsini's baker--it is for our good! Another Colonna
seizes on the daughter of Orsini's tailor--it is for our good! our
good--yes, for the good of the people! the good of the bakers and
tailors, eh?"

"Fellow," said the young nobleman, gravely, "if a Colonna did thus, he
did wrong; but the holiest cause may have bad supporters."

"Yes, the holy Church itself is propped on very in different columns,"
answered the smith, in a rude witticism on the affection of the pope for
the Colonna.

"He blasphemes! the smith blasphemes!" cried the partisans of that
powerful house. "A Colonna, a Colonna!"

"An Orsini, an Orsini!" was no less promptly the counter cry.

"The People!" shouted the smith, waving his formidable weapon far above
the heads of the group.

In an instant the whole throng, who had at first united against the
aggression of one man, were divided by the hereditary wrath of faction.
At the cry of Orsini, several new partisans hurried to the spot; the
friends of the Colonna drew themselves on one side--the defenders of
the Orsini on the other--and the few who agreed with the smith that both
factions were equally odious, and the people was the sole legitimate
cry in a popular commotion, would have withdrawn themselves from the
approaching melee, if the smith himself, who was looked upon by them as
an authority of great influence, had not--whether from resentment at the
haughty bearing of the young Colonna, or from that appetite of contest
not uncommon in men of a bulk and force which assure them in all
personal affrays the lofty pleasure of superiority--if, I say, the smith
himself had not, after a pause of indecision, retired among the Orsini,
and entrained, by his example, the alliance of his friends with the
favourers of that faction.

In popular commotions, each man is whirled along with the herd, often
half against his own approbation or assent. The few words of peace
by which Adrian di Castello commenced an address to his friends were
drowned amidst their shouts. Proud to find in their ranks one of the
most beloved, and one of the noblest of that name, the partisans of
the Colonna placed him in their front, and charged impetuously on their
foes. Adrian, however, who had acquired from circumstances something of
that chivalrous code which he certainly could not have owed to his Roman
birth, disdained at first to assault men among whom he recognised no
equal, either in rank or the practice of arms. He contented himself with
putting aside the few strokes that were aimed at him in the gathering
confusion of the conflict--few; for those who recognised him, even
amidst the bitterest partisans of the Orsini, were not willing to expose
themselves to the danger and odium of spilling the blood of a man, who,
in addition to his great birth and the terrible power of his connexions,
was possessed of a personal popularity, which he owed rather to a
comparison with the vices of his relatives than to any remarkable
virtues hitherto displayed by himself. The smith alone, who had as
yet taken no active part in the fray, seemed to gather himself up in
determined opposition as the cavalier now advanced within a few steps of
him.

"Did we not tell thee," quoth the giant, frowning, "that the Colonna
were, not less than the Orsini, the foes of the people? Look at thy
followers and clients: are they not cutting the throats of humble men by
way of vengeance for the crime of a great one? But that is the way one
patrician always scourges the insolence of another. He lays the rod on
the backs of the people, and then cries, 'See how just I am!'"

"I do not answer thee now," answered Adrian; "but if thou regrettest
with me this waste of blood, join with me in attempting to prevent it."

"I--not I! let the blood of the slaves flow today: the time is fast
coming when it shall be washed away by the blood of the lords."

"Away, ruffian!" said Adrian, seeking no further parley, and touching
the smith with the flat side of his sword. In an instant the hammer of
the smith swung in the air, and, but for the active spring of the young
noble, would infallibly have crushed him to the earth. Ere the smith
could gain time for a second blow, Adrian's sword passed twice through
his right arm, and the weapon fell heavily to the ground.

"Slay him, slay him!" cried several of the clients of the Colonna, now
pressing, dastard-like, round the disarmed and disabled smith.

"Ay, slay him!" said, in tolerable Italian, but with a barbarous accent,
one man, half-clad in armour, who had but just joined the group, and who
was one of those wild German bandits whom the Colonna held in their pay;
"he belongs to a horrible gang of miscreants sworn against all order
and peace. He is one of Rienzi's followers, and, bless the Three Kings!
raves about the People."

"Thou sayest right, barbarian," said the sturdy smith, in a loud voice,
and tearing aside the vest from his breast with his left hand; "come
all--Colonna and Orsini--dig to this heart with your sharp blades, and
when you have reached the centre, you will find there the object of your
common hatred--'Rienzi and the People!'"

As he uttered these words, in language that would have seemed above his
station (if a certain glow and exaggeration of phrase and sentiment were
not common, when excited, to all the Romans), the loudness of his voice
rose above the noise immediately round him, and stilled, for an instant,
the general din; and when, at last, the words, "Rienzi and the People"
rang forth, they penetrated midway through the increasing crowd, and
were answered as by an echo, with a hundred voices--"Rienzi and the
People!"

But whatever impression the words of the mechanic made on others, it was
equally visible in the young Colonna. At the name of Rienzi the glow
of excitement vanished from his cheek; he started back, muttered to
himself, and for a moment seemed, even in the midst of that stirring
commotion, to be lost in a moody and distant revery. He recovered, as
the shout died away; and saying to the smith, in a low tone, "Friend, I
am sorry for thy wound; but seek me on the morrow, and thou shalt find
thou hast wronged me;" he beckoned to the German to follow him, and
threaded his way through the crowd, which generally gave back as he
advanced. For the bitterest hatred to the order of the nobles was at
that time in Rome mingled with a servile respect for their persons, and
a mysterious awe of their uncontrollable power.

As Adrian passed through that part of the crowd in which the fray had
not yet commenced, the murmurs that followed him were not those which
many of his race could have heard.

"A Colonna," said one.

"Yet no ravisher," said another, laughing wildly.

"Nor murtherer," muttered a third, pressing his hand to his breast.
"'Tis not against him that my father's blood cries aloud."

"Bless him," said a fourth, "for as yet no man curses him!"

"Ah, God help us!" said an old man, with a long grey beard, leaning on
his staff: "The serpent's young yet; the fangs will show by and by."

"For shame, father! he is a comely youth, and not proud in the least.
What a smile he hath!" quoth a fair matron, who kept on the outskirt of
the melee.

"Farewell to a man's honour when a noble smiles on his wife!" was the
answer.

"Nay," said Luigi, a jolly butcher, with a roguish eye, "what a man
can win fairly from maid or wife, that let him do, whether plebeian or
noble--that's my morality; but when an ugly old patrician finds fair
words will not win fair looks, and carries me off a dame on the back of
a German boar, with a stab in the side for comfort to the spouse,--then,
I say, he is a wicked man, and an adulterer."

While such were the comments and the murmurs that followed the noble,
very different were the looks and words that attended the German
soldier.

Equally, nay, with even greater promptitude, did the crowd make way at
his armed and heavy tread; but not with looks of reverence:--the eye
glared as he approached; but the cheek grew pale--the head bowed--the
lip quivered; each man felt a shudder of hate and fear, as recognizing
a dread and mortal foe. And well and wrathfully did the fierce
mercenary note the signs of the general aversion. He pushed on
rudely--half-smiling in contempt, half-frowning in revenge, as he looked
from side to side; and his long, matted, light hair, tawny-coloured
moustache, and brawny front, contrasted strongly with the dark eyes,
raven locks, and slender frames of the Italians.

"May Lucifer double damn those German cut-throats!" muttered, between
his grinded teeth, one of the citizens.

"Amen!" answered, heartily, another.

"Hush!" said a third, timorously looking round; "if one of them hear
thee, thou art a lost man."

"Oh, Rome! Rome! to what art thou fallen!" said bitterly one citizen,
clothed in black, and of a higher seeming than the rest; "when thou
shudderest in thy streets at the tread of a hired barbarian!"

"Hark to one of our learned men, and rich citizens!" said the butcher,
reverently.

"'Tis a friend of Rienzi's," quoth another of the group, lifting his
cap.

With downcast eyes, and a face in which grief, shame, and wrath, were
visibly expressed, Pandulfo di Guido, a citizen of birth and repute,
swept slowly through the crowd, and disappeared.

Meanwhile, Adrian, having gained a street which, though in the
neighbourhood of the crowd, was empty and desolate, turned to his fierce
comrade. "Rodolf!" said he, "mark!--no violence to the citizens. Return
to the crowd, collect the friends of our house, withdraw them from the
scene; let not the Colonna be blamed for this day's violence; and assure
our followers, in my name, that I swear, by the knighthood I received at
the Emperor's hands, that by my sword shall Martino di Porto be punished
for his outrage. Fain would I, in person, allay the tumult, but my
presence only seems to sanction it. Go--thou hast weight with them all."

"Ay, Signor, the weight of blows!" answered the grim soldier. "But the
command is hard; I would fain let their puddle-blood flow an hour or
two longer. Yet, pardon me; in obeying thy orders, do I obey those of my
master, thy kinsman? It is old Stephen Colonna--who seldom spares blood
or treasure, God bless him--(save his own!)--whose money I hold, and to
whose hests I am sworn."

"Diavolo!" muttered the cavalier, and the angry spot was on his cheek;
but, with the habitual self-control of the Italian nobles, he smothered
his rising choler, and said aloud, with calmness, but dignity--

"Do as I bid thee; check this tumult--make us the forbearing party.
Let all be still within one hour hence, and call on me tomorrow for thy
reward; be this purse an earnest of my future thanks. As for my kinsman,
whom I command thee to name more reverently, 'tis in his name I speak.
Hark! the din increases--the contest swells--go--lose not another
moment."

Somewhat awed by the quiet firmness of the patrician, Rodolf nodded,
without answer, slid the money into his bosom, and stalked away into the
thickest of the throng. But, even ere he arrived, a sudden reaction had
