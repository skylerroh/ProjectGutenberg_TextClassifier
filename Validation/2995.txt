communication, when opinion forced them to consent to his
restitution, had tacked to the amnesty a clause as cowardly as it was
unconstitutional, and declared his incompetence to sit in the parliament
of his country. Burke on the contrary fought the whig fight with
a two-edged weapon: he was a great writer; as an orator he was
transcendent. In a dearth of that public talent for the possession of
which the whigs have generally been distinguished, Burke came forward
and established them alike in the parliament and the country. And what
was his reward? No sooner had a young and dissolute noble, who with
some of the aspirations of a Caesar oftener realised the conduct of
a Catiline, appeared on the stage, and after some inglorious
tergiversation adopted their colours, than they transferred to him
the command which had been won by wisdom and genius, vindicated by
unrivalled knowledge, and adorned by accomplished eloquence. When the
hour arrived for the triumph which he had prepared, he was not even
admitted into the Cabinet, virtually presided over by his graceless
pupil, and who, in the profuse suggestions of his teeming converse,
had found the principles and the information which were among the chief
claims to public confidence of Mr Fox.

Hard necessity made Mr Burke submit to the yoke, but the humiliation
could never be forgotten. Nemesis favours genius: the inevitable hour
at length arrived. A voice like the Apocalypse sounded over England and
even echoed in all the courts of Europe. Burke poured forth the vials
of his hoarded vengeance into the agitated heart of Christendom; he
stimulated the panic of a world by the wild pictures of his inspired
imagination; he dashed to the ground the rival who had robbed him of
his hard-earned greatness; rended in twain the proud oligarchy that
had dared to use and to insult him; and followed with servility by
the haughtiest and the most timid of its members, amid the frantic
exultation of his country, he placed his heel upon the neck of the
ancient serpent.

Among the whig followers of Mr Burke in this memorable defection, among
the Devonshires and the Portlands, the Spencers and the Fitzwilliams,
was the Earl of Marney, whom the whigs would not make a duke.

What was his chance of success from Mr Pitt?

If the history of England be ever written by one who has the knowledge
and the courage, and both qualities are equally requisite for the
undertaking, the world would be more astonished than when reading the
Roman annals by Niebuhr. Generally speaking, all the great events have
been distorted, most of the important causes concealed, some of
the principal characters never appear, and all who figure are so
misunderstood and misrepresented, that the result is a complete
mystification, and the perusal of the narrative about as profitable to
an Englishman as reading the Republic of Plato or the Utopia of More,
the pages of Gaudentio di Lucca or the adventures of Peter Wilkins.

The influence of races in our early ages, of the church in our middle,
and of parties in our modern history, are three great moving and
modifying powers, that must be pursued and analyzed with an untiring,
profound, and unimpassioned spirit, before a guiding ray can be secured.
A remarkable feature of our written history is the absence in its pages
of some of the most influential personages. Not one man in a thousand
for instance has ever heard of Major Wildman: yet he was the soul of
English politics in the most eventful period of this kingdom, and one
most interesting to this age, from 1640 to 1688; and seemed more than
once to hold the balance which was to decide the permanent form of
our government. But he was the leader of an unsuccessful party. Even,
comparatively speaking, in our own times, the same mysterious oblivion
is sometimes encouraged to creep over personages of great social
distinction as well as political importance.

The name of the second Pitt remains, fresh after forty years of great
events, a parliamentary beacon. He was the Chatterton of politics; the
"marvellous boy." Some have a vague impression that he was mysteriously
moulded by his great father: that he inherited the genius, the
eloquence, the state craft of Chatham. His genius was of a different
bent, his eloquence of a different class, his state craft of a different
school. To understand Mr Pitt, one must understand one of the suppressed
characters of English history, and that is Lord Shelburne.

When the fine genius of the injured Bolingbroke, the only peer of his
century who was educated, and proscribed by the oligarchy because they
were afraid of his eloquence, "the glory of his order and the shame,"
shut out from Parliament, found vent in those writings which recalled
to the English people the inherent blessings of their old free monarchy,
and painted in immortal hues his picture of a patriot king, the spirit
that he raised at length touched the heart of Carteret born a whig, yet
sceptical of the advantages of that patrician constitution which made
the Duke of Newcastle the most incompetent of men, but the chosen leader
of the Venetian party, virtually sovereign of England. Lord Carteret had
many brilliant qualities: he was undaunted, enterprising, eloquent; had
considerable knowledge of continental politics, was a great linguist,
a master of public law; and though he failed in his premature effort to
terminate the dogeship of George the Second, he succeeded in maintaining
a considerable though secondary position in public life. The young
Shelburne married his daughter. Of him it is singular we know less than
of his father-in-law, yet from the scattered traits some idea may be
formed of the ablest and most accomplished minister of the eighteenth
century. Lord Shelburne, influenced probably by the example and the
traditionary precepts of his eminent father-in-law, appears early to
have held himself aloof from the patrician connection, and entered
public life as the follower of Bute in the first great effort of George
the Third to rescue the sovereignty from what Lord Chatham called "the
Great Revolution families." He became in time a member of Lord Chatham's
last administration: one of the strangest and most unsuccessful efforts
to aid the grandson of George the Second in his struggle for political
emancipation. Lord Shelburne adopted from the first the Bolingbroke
system: a real royalty, in lieu of the chief magistracy; a permanent
alliance with France, instead of the whig scheme of viewing in that
power the natural enemy of England: and, above all, a plan of
commercial freedom, the germ of which may be found in the long-maligned
negotiations of Utrecht, but which in the instance of Lord Shelburne
were soon in time matured by all the economical science of Europe,
in which he was a proficient. Lord Shelburne seems to have been of
a reserved and somewhat astute disposition: deep and adroit, he was
however brave and firm. His knowledge was extensive and even profound.
He was a great linguist; he pursued both literary and scientific
investigations; his house was frequented by men of letters, especially
those distinguished by their political abilities or economical
attainments. He maintained the most extensive private correspondence of
any public man of his time. The earliest and most authentic information
reached him from all courts and quarters of Europe: and it was a common
phrase, that the minister of the day sent to him often for the important
information which the cabinet could not itself command. Lord Shelburne
was the first great minister who comprehended the rising importance
of the middle class; and foresaw in its future power a bulwark for the
throne against "the Great Revolution families." Of his qualities
in council we have no record; there is reason to believe that his
administrative ability was conspicuous: his speeches prove that, if not
supreme, he was eminent, in the art of parliamentary disputation, while
they show on all the questions discussed a richness and variety of
information with which the speeches of no statesman of that age except
Mr Burke can compare.

Such was the man selected by George the Third as his champion against
the Venetian party after the termination of the American war. The
prosecution of that war they had violently opposed, though it had
originated in their own policy. First minister in the House of Lords,
Shelburne entrusted the lead in the House of Commons to his Chancellor
of the Exchequer, the youthful Pitt. The administration was brief, but
it was not inglorious. It obtained peace, and for the first time since
the Revolution introduced into modern debate the legitimate principles
on which commerce should be conducted. It fell before the famous
Coalition with which "the Great Revolution families" commenced their
fiercest and their last contention for the patrician government of royal
England.

In the heat of that great strife, the king in the second hazardous
exercise of his prerogative entrusted the perilous command to Pitt.
Why Lord Shelburne on that occasion was set aside, will perhaps always
remain a mysterious passage of our political history, nor have we space
on the present occasion to attempt to penetrate its motives. Perhaps
the monarch, with a sense of the rising sympathies of his people, was
prescient of the magic power of youth in touching the heart of a nation.
Yet it would not be an unprofitable speculation if for a moment we
paused to consider what might have been the consequences to our country
if Mr Pitt had been content for a season again to lead the Commons under
Lord Shelburne, and have secured for England the unrivalled knowledge
and dexterity of that statesman in the conduct of our affairs during the
confounding fortunes of the French revolution. Lord Shelburne was the
only English minister competent to the task; he was the only public man
who had the previous knowledge requisite to form accurate conclusions
on such a conjuncture: his remaining speeches on the subject attest the
amplitude of his knowledge and the accuracy of his views: and in the
rout of Jena, or the agony of Austerlitz, one cannot refrain from
picturing the shade of Shelburne haunting the cabinet of Pitt, as the
ghost of Canning is said occasionally to linger about the speaker's
chair, and smile sarcastically on the conscientious mediocrities who
pilfered his hard-earned honours.

But during the happier years of Mr Pitt, the influence of the mind of
Shelburne may be traced throughout his policy. It was Lansdowne House
that made Pitt acquainted with Dr Price, a dissenting minister, whom
Lord Shelburne when at the head of affairs courageously offered to
make his private secretary, and who furnished Mr Pitt, among many other
important suggestions, with his original plan of the sinking fund. The
commercial treaties of '87 were struck in the same mint, and are notable
as the first effort made by the English government to emancipate the
country from the restrictive policy which had been introduced by the
"glorious revolution;" memorable epoch, that presented England at the
same time with a corn law and a public debt.. But on no subject was the
magnetic influence of the descendant of Sir William Petty more decided,
than in the resolution of his pupil to curb the power of the patrician
party by an infusion from the middle classes into the government of
the country. Hence the origin of Mr Pitt's famous and long-misconceived
plans of parliamentary reform. Was he sincere, is often asked by those
who neither seek to discover the causes nor are capable of calculating
the effects of public transactions. Sincere! Why, he was struggling
for his existence! And when baffled, first by the Venetian party, and
afterwards by the panic of Jacobinism, he was forced to forego his
direct purpose, he still endeavoured partially to effect it by a
circuitous process. He created a plebeian aristocracy and blended it
with the patrician oligarchy. He made peers of second-rate squires
and fat graziers. He caught them in the alleys of Lombard Street, and
clutched them from the counting-houses of Cornhill. When Mr Pitt in an
age of bank restriction declared that every man with an estate of ten
thousand a-year had a right to be a peer, he sounded the knell of
"the cause for which Hampden had died on the field, and Sydney on the
scaffold."

In ordinary times the pupil of Shelburne would have raised this country
to a state of great material prosperity, and removed or avoided many
of those anomalies which now perplex us; but he was not destined for
ordinary times; and though his capacity was vast and his spirit lofty,
he had not that passionate and creative genius required by an age of
revolution. The French outbreak was his evil daemon: he had not the
means of calculating its effects upon Europe. He had but a meagre
knowledge himself of continental politics: he was assisted by a very
inefficient diplomacy. His mind was lost in a convulsion of which he
neither could comprehend the causes nor calculate the consequences; and
forced to act, he acted not only violently, but in exact opposition to
the very system he was called into political existence to combat; he
appealed to the fears, the prejudices, and the passions of a privileged
class, revived the old policy of the oligarchy he had extinguished, and
plunged into all the ruinous excesses of French war and Dutch finance.

If it be a salutary principle in the investigation of historical
transactions to be careful in discriminating the cause from the
pretext, there is scarcely any instance in which the application of this
principle is more fertile in results, than in that of the Dutch invasion
of 1688. The real cause of this invasion was financial. The Prince of
Orange had found that the resources of Holland, however considerable,
were inadequate to sustain him in his internecine rivalry with the great
sovereign of France. In an authentic conversation which has descended to
us, held by William at the Hague with one of the prime abettors of the
invasion, the prince did not disguise his motives; he said, "nothing but
such a constitution as you have in England can have the credit that is
necessary to raise such sums as a great war requires." The prince came,
and used our constitution for his purpose: he introduced into England
the system of Dutch finance. The principle of that system was to
mortgage industry in order to protect property: abstractedly, nothing
can be conceived more unjust; its practice in England has been equally
injurious. In Holland, with a small population engaged in the same
pursuits, in fact a nation of bankers, the system was adapted to the
circumstances which had created it. All shared in the present spoil, and
therefore could endure the future burthen. And so to this day Holland
is sustained, almost solely sustained, by the vast capital thus created
which still lingers amongst its dykes. But applied to a country in
which the circumstances were entirely different; to a considerable and
rapidly-increasing population; where there was a numerous peasantry,
a trading middle class struggling into existence; the system of Dutch
finance, pursued more or less for nearly a century and a half, has ended
in the degradation of a fettered and burthened multitude. Nor have the
demoralizing consequences of the funding system on the more favoured
classes been less decided. It has made debt a national habit; it has
made credit the ruling power, not the exceptional auxiliary, of all
transactions; it has introduced a loose, inexact, haphazard, and
dishonest spirit in the conduct of both public and private life; a
spirit dazzling and yet dastardly: reckless of consequences and yet
shrinking from responsibility. And in the end, it has so overstimulated
the energies of the population to maintain the material engagements
of the state, and of society at large, that the moral condition of the
people has been entirely lost sight of.

A mortgaged aristocracy, a gambling foreign commerce, a home trade
founded on a morbid competition, and a degraded people; these are great
evils, but ought perhaps cheerfully to be encountered for the greater
blessings of civil and religious liberty. Yet the first would seem in
some degree to depend upon our Saxon mode of trial by our peers, upon
the stipulations of the great Norman charters, upon the practice and
the statute of Habeas Corpus,--a principle native to our common law,
but established by the Stuarts; nor in a careful perusal of the Bill
of Rights, or in an impartial scrutiny of the subsequent legislation of
those times, though some diminution of our political franchises must be
confessed, is it easy to discover any increase of our civil privileges.
To those indeed who believe that the English nation,--at all times
a religious and Catholic people, but who even in the days of the
Plantagenets were anti-papal,--were in any danger of again falling under
the yoke of the Pope of Rome in the reign of James the Second, religious
liberty was perhaps acceptable, though it took the shape of a discipline
which at once anathematized a great portion of the nation, and virtually
establishing Puritanism in Ireland, laid the foundation of those
mischiefs which are now endangering the empire.

That the last of the Stuarts had any other object in his impolitic
manoeuvres, than an impracticable scheme to blend the two churches,
there is now authority to disbelieve. He certainly was guilty of
the offence of sending an envoy openly to Rome, who, by the bye, was
received by the Pope with great discourtesy; and her Majesty Queen
Victoria, whose Protestantism cannot be doubted, for it is one of her
chief titles to our homage, has at this time a secret envoy at the same
court: and that is the difference between them: both ministers doubtless
working however fruitlessly for the same object: the termination of
those terrible misconceptions, political and religious, that have
occasioned so many martyrdoms, and so many crimes alike to sovereigns
and to subjects.

If James the Second had really attempted to re-establish Popery in this
country, the English people, who had no hand in his overthrow, would
doubtless soon have stirred and secured their "Catholic and Apostolic
church," independent of any foreign dictation; the church to which they
still regularly profess their adherence; and being a practical people,
it is possible that they might have achieved their object and yet
retained their native princes; under which circumstances we might
have been saved from the triple blessings of Venetian politics, Dutch
finance, and French wars: against which, in their happiest days, and
with their happiest powers, struggled the three greatest of English
statesmen,--Bolingbroke, Shelburne, and lastly the son of Chatham.

We have endeavoured in another work, not we hope without something of
the impartiality of the future, to sketch the character and career of
his successors. From his death to 1825, the political history of England
is a history of great events and little men. The rise of Mr Canning,
long kept down by the plebeian aristocracy of Mr Pitt as an adventurer,
had shaken parties to their centre. His rapid disappearance from the
scene left both whigs and tories in a state of disorganization. The
distinctive principles of these connexions were now difficult to trace.
That period of public languor which intervenes between the breaking up
of parties and the formation of factions now transpired in England. An
exhausted sensualist on the throne, who only demanded from his ministers
repose, a voluptuous aristocracy, and a listless people, were content,
in the absence of all public conviction and national passion, to consign
the government of the country to a great man, whose decision relieved
the sovereign, whose prejudices pleased the nobles, and whose
achievements dazzled the multitude.

The DUKE OF WELLINGTON brought to the post of first minister immortal
fame; a quality of success which would almost seem to include all
others. His public knowledge was such as might be expected from one
whose conduct already formed an important portion of the history of his
country. He had a personal and intimate acquaintance with the sovereigns
and chief statesmen of Europe, a kind of information in which English
ministers have generally been deficient, but without which the
management of our external affairs must at the best be haphazard. He
possessed administrative talents of the highest order.

The tone of the age, the temper of the country, the great qualities
and the high character of the minister, indicated a long and prosperous
administration. The only individual in his cabinet who, from a
combination of circumstances rather than from any intellectual supremacy
over his colleagues, was competent to be his rival, was content to be
his successor. In his most aspiring moments, Mr Peel in all probability
aimed at no higher reach; and with youth and the leadership of the House
of Commons, one has no reason to be surprised at his moderation.
The conviction that the duke's government would only cease with the
termination of his public career was so general, that the moment he was
installed in office, the whigs smiled on him; political conciliation
became the slang of the day, and the fusion of parties the babble of
clubs and the tattle of boudoirs.

How comes it then that so great a man, in so great a position, should
have so signally failed? Should have broken up his government, wrecked
his party, and so completely annihilated his political position, that,
even with his historical reputation to sustain him, he can since only
re-appear in the councils of his sovereign in a subordinate, not to say
equivocal, character?

With all those great qualities which will secure him a place in our
history not perhaps inferior even to Marlborough, the Duke of Wellington
has one deficiency which has been the stumbling-block of his civil
career. Bishop Burnet, in speculating on the extraordinary influence of
Lord Shaftesbury, and accounting how a statesman, so inconsistent in
his conduct and so false to his confederates, should have so powerfully
controlled his country, observes, "HIS STRENGTH LAY IN HIS KNOWLEDGE OF
ENGLAND."


Now that is exactly the kind of knowledge which the Duke of Wellington
never possessed.

When the king, finding that in Lord Goderich he had a minister who,
instead of deciding, asked his royal master for advice, sent for the
Duke of Wellington to undertake the government, a change in the carriage
of his grace was perceived by some who had the opportunity to form an
opinion on such a subject. If one might venture to use such a word
in reference to such a man, we might remark, that the duke had been
somewhat daunted by the selection of Mr Canning. It disappointed great
hopes, it baffled great plans, and dispelled for a season the conviction
that, it is believed, had been long maturing in his grace's mind; that
he was the man of the age, that his military career had been only a
preparation for a civil course not less illustrious; and that it was
reserved for him to control for the rest of his life undisputed the
destinies of a country, which was indebted to him in no slight degree
for its European pre-eminence. The death of Mr Canning revived, the rout
of Lord Goderich restored, these views.

Napoleon, at St Helena, speculating in conversation on the future career
of his conqueror, asked, "What will Wellington do? After all he has
done, he will not be content to be quiet. He will change the dynasty."

Had the great exile been better acquainted with the real character of
our Venetian constitution, he would have known that to govern England
in 1820, it was not necessary to change its dynasty. But the Emperor,
though wrong in the main, was right by the bye. It was clear that the
energies that had twice entered Paris as a conqueror, and had made kings
and mediatised princes at Vienna, would not be content to subside into
ermined insignificance. The duke commenced his political tactics early.
The cabinet of Lord Liverpool, especially during its latter term, was
the hot-bed of many intrigues; but the obstacles were numerous, though
the appointing fate, in which his grace believed, removed them. The
disappearance of Lord Castlereagh and Mr Canning from the scene was
alike unexpected. The Duke of Wellington was at length prime minister,
and no individual ever occupied that post more conscious of its power,
and more determined to exercise it.

This is not the occasion on which we shall attempt to do justice to a
theme so instructive as the administration of his grace. Treated with
impartiality and sufficient information, it would be an invaluable
contribution to the stores of our political knowledge and national
experience. Throughout its brief but eccentric and tumultuous annals we
see continual proof, how important is that knowledge "in which lay Lord
Shaftesbury's strength." In twenty-four months we find an aristocracy
estranged, without a people being conciliated; while on two several
occasions, first, the prejudices, and then the pretensions of the middle
class, were alike treated with contumely. The public was astonished
at hearing of statesmen of long parliamentary fame, men round whom the
intelligence of the nation had gathered for years with confidence, or
at least with interest, being expelled from the cabinet in a manner not
unworthy of Colonel Joyce, while their places were filled by second-rate
soldiers, whose very names were unknown to the great body of the people,
and who under no circumstances should have aspired beyond the government
of a colony. This administration which commenced in arrogance ended
in panic. There was an interval of perplexity; when occurred the most
ludicrous instance extant of an attempt at coalition; subordinates were
promoted, while negotiations were still pending with their chiefs; and
these negotiations, undertaken so crudely, were terminated in pique; in
a manner which added to political disappointment personal offence. When
even his parasites began to look gloomy, the duke had a specific that
was to restore all, and having allowed every element of power to escape
his grasp, he believed he could balance everything by a beer bill. The
growl of reform was heard but it was not very fierce. There was yet time
to save himself. His grace precipitated a revolution which might have
been delayed for half a century, and never need have occurred in
so aggravated a form. He rather fled than retired. He commenced his
ministry like Brennus, and finished it like the tall Gaul sent to murder
the rival of Sylla, but who dropped his weapon before the undaunted gaze
of his intended victim.

Lord Marney was spared the pang of the catastrophe. Promoted to a high
office in the household, and still hoping that, by the aid of his party,
it was yet destined for him to achieve the hereditary purpose of his
family, he died in the full faith of dukism; worshipping the duke and
believing that ultimately he should himself become a duke. It was under
all the circumstances an euthanasia; he expired leaning as it were on
his white wand and babbling of strawberry leaves.




Book 1 Chapter 4



"My dear Charles," said Lady Marney to Egremont the morning after the
Derby, as breakfasting with her in her boudoir he detailed some of the
circumstances of the race, "we must forget your naughty horse. I
sent you a little note this morning, because I wished to see you most
particularly before you went out. Affairs," continued Lady Marney, first
looking round the chamber to see whether there were any fairy listening
to her state secrets, "affairs are critical."

"No doubt of that," thought Egremont, the horrid phantom of settling-day
seeming to obtrude itself between his mother and himself; but not
knowing precisely at what she was driving, he merely sipped his tea, and
innocently replied, "Why?"

"There will be a dissolution," said Lady Marney.

"What are we coming in?"

Lady Marney shook her head.

"The present men will not better their majority," said Egremont.

"I hope not," said Lady Marney.

"Why you always said, that with another general election we must come
in, whoever dissolved."

"But that was with the court in our favour," rejoined Lady Marney
mournfully.

"What, has the king changed?" said Egremont. "I thought it was all
right."

"All was right," said Lady Marney. "These men would have been turned out
again, had he only lived three months more."

"Lived!" exclaimed Egremont.

"Yes," said Lady Marney; "the king is dying."

Slowly delivering himself of an ejaculation, Egremont leant back in his
chair.

"He may live a month," said Lady Marnev; "he cannot live two. It is the
greatest of secrets; known at this moment only to four individuals, and
I communicate it to you, my dear Charles, in that absolute confidence
which I hope will always subsist between us, because it is an event that
may greatly affect your career."

"How so, my dear mother?"

"Marbury! I have settled with Mr Tadpole that you shall stand for the
old borough. With the government in our hands, as I had anticipated
at the general election, success I think was certain: under the
circumstances which we must encounter, the struggle will be more severe,
but I think we shall do it: and it will be a happy day for me to have
our own again, and to see you in Parliament, my dear child."

"Well, my dear mother, I should like very much to be in Parliament, and
particularly to sit for the old borough; but I fear the contest will be
very expensive," said Egremont inquiringly.

"Oh! I have no doubt," said Lady Marney, "that we shall have
some monster of the middle class, some tinker or tailor, or
candlestick-maker, with his long purse, preaching reform and practising
corruption: exactly as the liberals did under Walpole: bribery was
unknown in the time of the Stuarts; but we have a capital registration,
Mr Tadpole tells me. And a young candidate with the old name will tell,"
said Lady Marney, with a smile: "and I shall go down and canvass, and we
must do what we can."

"I have great faith in your canvassing," said Egremont; "but still, at
the same time, the powder and shot--"

"Are essential," said Lady Marney, "I know it, in these corrupt days:
but Marney will of course supply those. It is the least he can do:
regaining the family influence, and letting us hold up our heads again.
I shall write to him the moment I am justified," said Lady Marney,
"perhaps you will do so yourself, Charles."

"Why, considering I have not seen my brother for two years, and we did
not part on the best possible terms--"

"But that is all forgotten."

"By your good offices, dear mother, who are always doing good: and yet,"
continued Egremont, after a moment's pause, "I am not disposed to write
to Marney, especially to ask a favour."

"Well, I will write," said Lady Marney; "though I cannot admit it is
any favour. Perhaps it would be better that you should see him first. I
cannot understand why he keeps so at the Abbey. I am sure I found it
a melancholy place enough in my time. I wish you had gone down there,
Charles, if it had been only for a few days."

"Well I did not, my dear mother, and I cannot go now. I shall trust to
you. But are you quite sure that the king is going to die?"

"I repeat to you, it is certain," replied Lady Marney, in a lowered
voice, but a decided tone; "certain, certain, certain. My authority
cannot be mistaken: but no consideration in the world must throw you off
your guard at this moment; breathe not the shadow of what you know."

At this moment a servant entered and delivered a note to Lady Marney,
who read it with an ironical smile. It was from Lady St Julians, and ran
thus:--


    "Most confidential.
    "My dearest Lady Marney,

    "It is a false report: he is ill, but not dangerously; the
hay     fever; he always has it; nothing more: I will tell my
     authority when we meet; I dare not write it.  It will
satisfy     you.  I am going on with my quadrille.

    "Most affectionately yours,
    "A. St J."


"Poor woman! she is always wrong," said Lady Marney throwing the note to
Egremont. "Her quadrille will never take place, which is a pity, as it
is to consist only of beauties and eldest sons. I suppose I must send
her a line," and she wrote:


    "My dearest Lady St Julians,

    "How good of you to write to me, and send me such cheering

Lord Marney left several children; his heir was five years older than
the next son Charles who at the period of his father's death was
at Christchurch and had just entered the last year of his minority.
Attaining that age, he received the sum of fifteen thousand pounds,
his portion, a third of which amount his expenditure had then already

and of the State, rotten-boroughs. To do nothing and get something,
formed a boy's ideal of a manly career. There was nothing in the lot,
