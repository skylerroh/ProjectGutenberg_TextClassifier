PRELUDE.


The heroic deeds of Highlanders, both in these islands and elsewhere,
have been told in verse and prose, and not more often, nor more loudly,
than they deserve. But we must remember, now and then, that there have
been heroes likewise in the lowland and in the fen. Why, however, poets
have so seldom sung of them; why no historian, save Mr. Motley in his
"Rise of the Dutch Republic," has condescended to tell the tale of their
doughty deeds, is a question not difficult to answer.

In the first place, they have been fewer in number. The lowlands of
the world, being the richest spots, have been generally the soonest
conquered, the soonest civilized, and therefore the soonest taken out
of the sphere of romance and wild adventure, into that of order and law,
hard work and common sense, as well as--too often--into the sphere of
slavery, cowardice, luxury, and ignoble greed. The lowland populations,
for the same reasons, have been generally the first to deteriorate,
though not on account of the vices of civilization. The vices of
incivilization are far worse, and far more destructive of human life;
and it is just because they are so, that rude tribes deteriorate
physically less than polished nations. In the savage struggle for life,
none but the strongest, healthiest, cunningest, have a chance of living,
prospering, and propagating their race. In the civilized state, on the
contrary, the weakliest and the silliest, protected by law, religion,
and humanity, have chance likewise, and transmit to their offspring
their own weakliness or silliness. In these islands, for instance,
at the time of the Norman Conquest, the average of man was doubtless
superior, both in body and mind, to the average of man now, simply
because the weaklings could not have lived at all; and the rich and
delicate beauty, in which the women of the Eastern Counties still
surpass all other races in these isles, was doubtless far more common in
proportion to the numbers of the population.

Another reason--and one which every Scot will understand--why lowland
heroes "carent vate sacro," is that the lowlands and those who live in
them are wanting in the poetic and romantic elements. There is in the
lowland none of that background of the unknown, fantastic, magical,
terrible, perpetually feeding curiosity and wonder, which still remains
in the Scottish highlands; which, when it disappears from thence, will
remain embalmed forever in the pages of Walter Scott. Against that
half-magical background his heroes stand out in vivid relief; and justly
so. It was not put there by him for stage purposes; it was there as a
fact; and the men of whom he wrote were conscious of it, were moulded by
it, were not ashamed of its influence. Nature among the mountains is too
fierce, too strong, for man. He cannot conquer her, and she awes him. He
cannot dig down the cliffs, or chain the storm-blasts; and his fear of
them takes bodily shape: he begins to people the weird places of the
earth with weird beings, and sees nixes in the dark linns as he fishes
by night, dwarfs in the caves where he digs, half-trembling, morsels of
copper and iron for his weapons, witches and demons on the snow-blast
which overwhelms his herd and his hut, and in the dark clouds which
brood on the untrodden mountain-peak. He lives in fear: and yet, if he
be a valiant-hearted man, his fears do him little harm. They may break
out, at times, in witch-manias, with all their horrible suspicions, and
thus breed cruelty, which is the child of fear; but on the whole they
rather produce in man thoughtfulness, reverence, a sense, confused
yet precious, of the boundless importance of the unseen world. His
superstitions develop his imagination; the moving accidents of a wild
life call out in him sympathy and pathos; and the mountaineer becomes
instinctively a poet.

The lowlander, on the other hand, has his own strength, his own
"virtues," or manfulnesses, in the good old sense of the word: but they
are not for the most part picturesque or even poetical.

He finds out, soon enough for his weal and his bane, that he is stronger
than Nature; and right tyrannously and irreverently he lords it over
her, clearing, delving, diking, building, without fear or shame. He
knows of no natural force greater than himself, save an occasional
thunder-storm; and against that, as he grows more cunning, he insures
his crops. Why should he reverence Nature? Let him use her, and eat. One
cannot blame him. Man was sent into the world (so says the Scripture)
to fill and subdue the earth. But he was sent into the world for other
purposes, which the lowlander is but too apt to forget. With the awe of
Nature, the awe of the unseen dies out in him. Meeting with no visible
superior, he is apt to become not merely unpoetical and irreverent, but
somewhat of a sensualist and an atheist. The sense of the beautiful dies
out in him more and more. He has little or nothing around him to refine
or lift up his soul, and unless he meet with a religion and with a
civilization which can deliver him, he may sink into that dull brutality
which is too common among the lowest classes of the English lowlands,
and remain for generations gifted with the strength and industry of the
ox, and with the courage of the lion, and, alas! with the intellect of
the former, and the self-restraint of the latter.

But there may be a period in the history of a lowland race when they,
too, become historic for a while. There was such a period for the men of
the Eastern Counties; for they proved it by their deeds.

When the men of Wessex, the once conquering race of Britain, fell at
Hastings once and for all, and struck no second blow, then the men of
the Danelagh disdained to yield to the Norman invader. For seven long
years they held their own, not knowing, like true Englishmen, when
they were beaten; and fought on desperate, till there were none left to
fight. Their bones lay white on every island in the fens; their corpses
rotted on gallows beneath every Norman keep; their few survivors crawled
into monasteries, with eyes picked out, or hands and feet cut off,
or took to the wild wood as strong outlaws, like their successors and
representatives, Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John, Adam Bell, and Clym of
the Cleugh, and William of Cloudeslee. But they never really bent their
necks to the Norman yoke; they kept alive in their hearts that proud
spirit of personal independence, which they brought with them from the
moors of Denmark and the dales of Norway; and they kept alive, too,
though in abeyance for a while, those free institutions which were
without a doubt the germs of our British liberty.

They were a changed folk since first they settled in that
Danelagh;--since first in the days of King Beorhtric, "in the year 787,
three ships of Northmen came from Haeretha land, and the King's reeve
rode to the place, and would have driven them up to the King's town, for
he knew not what men they were: but they slew him there and then"; and
after the Saxons and Angles began to find out to their bitter bale what
men they were, those fierce Vikings out of the dark northeast.

But they had long ceased to burn farms, sack convents, torture monks
for gold, and slay every human being they met, in mere Berserker lust
of blood. No Barnakill could now earn his nickname by entreating his
comrades, as they tossed the children on their spear-points, to "Na kill
the barns." Gradually they had settled down on the land, intermarried
with the Angles and Saxons, and colonized all England north and east of
Watling Street (a rough line from London to Chester), and the eastern
lowlands of Scotland likewise. Gradually they had deserted Thor and Odin
for "the White Christ"; had their own priests and bishops, and built
their own minsters. The convents which the fathers had destroyed, the
sons, or at least the grandsons, rebuilt; and often, casting away sword
and axe, they entered them as monks themselves; and Peterborough,
Ely, and above all Crowland, destroyed by them in Alfred's time with a
horrible destruction, had become their holy places, where they decked
the altars with gold and jewels, with silks from the far East, and furs
from the far North; and where, as in sacred fortresses, they, and the
liberty of England with them, made their last unavailing stand.

For a while they had been lords of all England. The Anglo-Saxon race was
wearing out. The men of Wessex, priest-ridden, and enslaved by their
own aristocracy, quailed before the free Norsemen, among whom was not a
single serf. The God-descended line of Cerdic and Alfred was worn out.
Vain, incapable, profligate kings, the tools of such prelates as Odo
and Dunstan, were no match for such wild heroes as Thorkill the tall, or
Olaf Trygvasson, or Swend Forkbeard. The Danes had gradually colonized,
not only their own Danelagh and Northumbria, but great part of Wessex.
Vast sums of Danegelt were yearly sent out of the country to buy off
the fresh invasions which were perpetually threatened. Then Ethelred the
Unready, Ethelred Evil-counsel, advised himself to fulfil his name,
and the curse which Dunstan had pronounced against him at the baptismal
font. By his counsel the men of Wessex rose against the unsuspecting
Danes, and on St. Brice's eve, A.D. 1002, murdered them all with
tortures, man, woman, and child. It may be that they only did to the
children as the fathers had done to them: but the deed was "worse than a
crime; it was a mistake." The Danes of the Danelagh and of Northumbria,
their brothers of Denmark and Norway, the Orkneys and the east coast of
Ireland, remained unharmed. A mighty host of Vikings poured from thence
into England the very next year, under Swend Forkbeard and the great
Canute; and after thirteen fearful campaigns came the great battle of
Assingdown in Essex, where "Canute had the victory; and all the English
nation fought against him, and all the nobility of the English race was
there destroyed."

That same year saw the mysterious death of Edmund Ironside, the last
man of Cerdic's race worthy of the name. For the next twenty-five years,
Danish kings ruled from the Forth to the Land's End.

A noble figure he was, that great and wise Canute, the friend of the
famous Godiva, and Leofric, Godiva's husband, and Siward Biorn, the
conqueror of Macbeth; trying to expiate by justice and mercy the dark
deeds of his bloodstained youth; trying (and not in vain) to blend the
two races over which he ruled; rebuilding the churches and monasteries
which his father had destroyed; bringing back in state to Canterbury the
body of Archbishop Elphege--not unjustly called by the Saxons martyr
and saint--whom Tall Thorkill's men had murdered with beef bones and
ox-skulls, because he would not give up to them the money destined
for God's poor; rebuking, as every child has heard, his housecarles'
flattery by setting his chair on the brink of the rising tide; and then
laying his golden crown, in token of humility, on the high altar of
Winchester, never to wear it more. In Winchester lie his bones unto this
day, or what of them the civil wars have left: and by him lie the bones
of his son Hardicanute, in whom, as in his half-brother Harold Harefoot
before him, the Danish power fell to swift decay, by insolence and
drink and civil war; and with the Danish power England fell to pieces
likewise.

Canute had divided England into four great earldoms, each ruled, under
him, by a jarl, or earl--a Danish, not a Saxon title.

At his death in 1036, the earldoms of Northumbria and East Anglia--the
more strictly Danish parts--were held by a true Danish hero, Siward
Biorn, alias _Digre_ "the Stout", conqueror of Macbeth, and son of the
Fairy Bear; proving his descent, men said, by his pointed and hairy
ears.

Mercia, the great central plateau of England, was held by Earl Leofric,
husband of the famous Lady Godiva.

Wessex, which Canute had at first kept in his own hands, had passed
into those of the famous Earl Godwin, the then ablest man in England.
Possessed of boundless tact and cunning, gifted with an eloquence which
seems, from the accounts remaining of it, to have been rather that of
a Greek than an Englishman; himself of high--perhaps of royal--Sussex
blood (for the story of his low birth seems a mere fable of his French
enemies), and married first to Canute's sister, and then to his niece,
he was fitted, alike by fortunes and by talents, to be the king-maker
which he became.

Such a system may have worked well as long as the brain of a hero was
there to overlook it all. But when that brain was turned to dust, the
history of England became, till the Norman Conquest, little more than
the history of the rivalries of the two great houses of Godwin and
Leofric.

Leofric had the first success in king-making. He, though bearing a
Saxon name, was the champion of the Danish party and of Canute's son,
or reputed son, Harold Harefoot; and he succeeded, by the help of the
"Thanes north of Thames," and the "lithsmen of London," which city
was more than half Danish in those days, in setting his puppet on the
throne. But the blood of Canute had exhausted itself. Within seven years
Harold Harefoot and Hardicanute, who succeeded him, had died as foully
as they lived; and Godwin's turn had come.

He, though married to a Danish princess, and acknowledging his Danish
connection by the Norse names which were borne by his three most famous
sons, Harold, Sweyn, and Tostig, constituted himself the champion of
the men of Wessex and the house of Cerdic. He had murdered, or at least
caused to be murdered, horribly, Alfred the Etheling, King Ethelred's
son and heir-apparent, when it seemed his interest to support the claims
of Hardicanute against Harefoot. He now found little difficulty in
persuading his victim's younger brother to come to England, and become
at once his king, his son-in-law and his puppet.

Edward the Confessor, if we are to believe the monks whom he pampered,
was naught but virtue and piety, meekness and magnanimity,--a model
ruler of men. Such a model ruler he was, doubtless, as monks would be
glad to see on every throne; because while he rules his subjects,
they rule him. No wonder, therefore, that (according to William of
Malmesbury) the happiness of his times (famed as he was both for
miracles and the spirit of prophecy) "was revealed in a dream to
Brithwin, Bishop of Wilton, who made it public"; who, meditating in King
Canute's time on "the near extinction of the royal race of the English,"
was "rapt up on high, and saw St. Peter consecrating Edward king. His
chaste life also was pointed out, and the exact period of his reign
(twenty-four years) determined; and, when inquiring about his posterity,
it was answered, 'The kingdom of the English belongs to God. After you,
He will provide a king according to his pleasure.'" But those who will
look at the facts will see in the holy Confessor's character little but
what is pitiable, and in his reign little but what is tragical.

Civil wars, invasions, outlawry of Godwin and his sons by the Danish
party; then of Alfgar, Leofric's son, by the Saxon party; the outlaws on
either side attacking and plundering the English shores by the help of
Norsemen, Welshmen, Irish, and Danes,--any mercenaries who could be got
together; and then,--"In the same year Bishop Aldred consecrated the
minster at Gloucester to the glory of God and of St. Peter, and then
went to Jerusalem with such splendor as no man had displayed before
him"; and so forth. The sum and substance of what was done in those
"happy times" may be well described in the words of the Anglo-Saxon
chronicler for the year 1058. "This year Alfgar the earl was banished;
but he came in again with violence, through aid of Griffin (the king
of North Wales, his brother-in-law). And this year came a fleet from
Norway. It is tedious to tell how these matters went." These were the
normal phenomena of a reign which seemed, to the eyes of monks, a
holy and a happy one; because the king refused, whether from spite or
superstition, to have an heir to the house of Cerdic, and spent his time
between prayer, hunting, the seeing of fancied visions, the uttering of
fancied prophecies, and the performance of fancied miracles.

But there were excuses for him. An Englishman only in name,--a
Norman, not only of his mother's descent (she was aunt of William the
Conqueror), but by his early education on the Continent,--he loved the
Norman better than the Englishman; Norman knights and clerks filled his
court, and often the high dignities of his provinces, and returned as
often as expelled; the Norman-French language became fashionable;
Norman customs and manners the signs of civilization; and thus all was
preparing steadily for the great catastrophe, by which, within a year of
Edward's death, the Norman became master of the land.

Perhaps it ought to have been so. Perhaps by no other method could
England, and, with England, Scotland, and in due time Ireland, have
become partakers of that classic civilization and learning, the fount
whereof, for good and for evil, was Rome and the Pope of Rome: but
the method was at least wicked; the actors in it tyrannous, brutal,
treacherous, hypocritical; and the conquest of England by William will
remain to the end of time a mighty crime, abetted--one may almost say
made possible, as too many such crimes have been before and since--by
the intriguing ambition of the Pope of Rome.

Against that tyranny the free men of the Danelagh and of Northumbria
rose. If Edward, the descendant of Cerdic, had been little to them,
William, the descendant of Rollo, was still less. That French-speaking
knights should expel them from their homes, French-chanting monks from
their convents, because Edward had promised the crown of England to
William, his foreign cousin, or because Harold Godwinsson of Wessex had
sworn on the relics of all the saints to be William's man, was contrary
to their common-sense of right and reason.

So they rose and fought: too late, it may be, and without unity or
purpose; and they were worsted by an enemy who had both unity and
purpose; whom superstition, greed, and feudal discipline kept together,
at least in England, in one compact body of unscrupulous and terrible
confederates.

But theirs was a land worth fighting for,--a good land and large: from
Humber mouth inland to the Trent and merry Sherwood, across to Chester
and the Dee, round by Leicester and the five burghs of the Danes;
eastward again to Huntingdon and Cambridge (then a poor village on the
site of an old Roman town); and then northward again into the wide
fens, the land of the Girvii and the Eormingas, "the children of the
peat-bog," where the great central plateau of England slides into the
sea, to form, from the rain and river washings of eight shires, lowlands
of a fertility inexhaustible, because ever-growing to this day.

They have a beauty of their own, these great fens, even now, when they
are diked and drained, tilled and fenced,--a beauty as of the sea, of
boundless expanse and freedom. Much more had they that beauty eight
hundred years ago, when they were still, for the most part, as God had
made them, or rather was making them even then. The low rolling uplands
were clothed in primeval forest: oak and ash, beech and elm, with here
and there, perhaps, a group of ancient pines, ragged and decayed, and
fast dying out in England even then; though lingering still in the
forests of the Scotch highlands.

Between the forests were open wolds, dotted with white sheep and golden
gorse; rolling plains of rich though ragged turf, whether cleared by the
hand of man or by the wild fires which often swept over the hills.
And between the wood and the wold stood many a Danish "town," with its
clusters of low straggling buildings round the holder's house, stone or
mud below, and wood above; its high dikes round tiny fields; its flocks
of sheep ranging on the wold; its herds of swine in the forest; and
below, a more precious possession still,--its herds of mares and colts,
which fed with the cattle in the rich grass-fen.

For always, from the foot of the wolds, the green flat stretched away,
illimitable, to an horizon where, from the roundness of the earth, the
distant trees and islands were hulled down like ships at sea. The firm
horse-fen lay, bright green, along the foot of the wold; beyond it, the
browner peat, or deep fen; and among it, dark velvet alder beds, long
lines of reed-rond, emerald in spring, and golden under the autumn sun;
shining river-reaches; broad meres dotted with a million fowl, while the
cattle waded along their edges after the rich sedge-grass, or wallowed
in the mire through the hot summer's day. Here and there, too, upon the
far horizon, rose a tall line of ashen trees, marking some island of
firm rich soil. Here and there, too, as at Ramsey and Crowland, the huge
ashes had disappeared before the axes of the monks, and a minster tower
rose over the fen, amid orchards, gardens, cornfields, pastures, with
here and there a tree left standing for shade. "Painted with flowers
in the spring," with "pleasant shores embosomed in still lakes," as the
monk-chronicler of Ramsey has it, those islands seemed to such as the
monk terrestrial paradises.

Overhead the arch of heaven spread more ample than elsewhere, as over
the open sea; and that vastness gave, and still gives, such "effects"
of cloudland, of sunrise, and sunset, as can be seen nowhere else within
these isles. They might well have been star worshippers, those Girvii,
had their sky been as clear as that of the East: but they were like to
have worshipped the clouds rather than the stars, according to the
too universal law, that mankind worship the powers which do them harm,
rather than the powers which do them good.

And therefore the Danelagh men, who feared not mortal sword, or axe,
feared witches, ghosts, Pucks, Will-o'-the-Wisps, werewolves, spirits of
the wells and of the trees, and all dark, capricious, and harmful beings
whom their fancy conjured up out of the wild, wet, and unwholesome
marshes, or the dark wolf-haunted woods. For that fair land, like all
things on earth, had its darker aspect. The foul exhalations of autumn
called up fever and ague, crippling and enervating, and tempting,
almost compelling, to that wild and desperate drinking which was the
Scandinavian's special sin. Dark and sad were those short autumn days,
when all the distances were shut off, and the air choked with foul
brown fog and drenching rains from off the eastern sea; and pleasant
the bursting forth of the keen north-east wind, with all its whirling
snowstorms. For though it sent men hurrying out into the storm, to drive
the cattle in from the fen, and lift the sheep out of the snow-wreaths,
and now and then never to return, lost in mist and mire, in ice and
snow;--yet all knew that after the snow would come the keen frost and
the bright sun and cloudless blue sky, and the fenman's yearly holiday,
when, work being impossible, all gave themselves up to play, and swarmed
upon the ice on skates and sledges, and ran races, township against
township, or visited old friends full forty miles away; and met
everywhere faces as bright and ruddy as their own, cheered by the keen
wine of that dry and bracing frost.

Such was the Fenland; hard, yet cheerful; rearing a race of hard and
cheerful men; showing their power in old times in valiant fighting, and
for many a century since in that valiant industry which has drained and
embanked the land of the Girvii, till it has become a very "Garden
of the Lord." And the Scotsman who may look from the promontory of
Peterborough, the "golden borough" of old time; or from the tower of
Crowland, while Hereward and Torfrida sleep in the ruined nave beneath;
or from the heights of that Isle of Ely which was so long "the camp of
refuge" for English freedom; over the labyrinth of dikes and lodes, the
squares of rich corn and verdure,--will confess that the lowland, as
well as the highland, can at times breed gallant men. [Footnote: The
story of Hereward (often sung by minstrels and old-wives in succeeding
generations) may be found in the "Metrical Chronicle of Geoffrey
Gaimar," and in the prose "Life of Hereward" (paraphrased from that
written by Leofric, his house-priest), and in the valuable fragment
"Of the family of Hereward." These have all three been edited by Mr.
T. Wright. The account of Hereward in Ingulf seems taken, and that
carelessly, from the same source as the Latin prose, "De Gestis
Herewardi." A few curious details may be found in Peter of Blois's
continuation of Ingulf; and more, concerning the sack of Peterborough,
in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. I have followed the contemporary
authorities as closely as I could, introducing little but what was
necessary to reconcile discrepancies, or to illustrate the history,
manners, and sentiments of the time.--C. K.]




CHAPTER I.

HOW HEREWARD WAS OUTLAWED, AND WENT NORTH TO SEEK HIS FORTUNES.


Known to all is Lady Godiva, the most beautiful as well as the most
saintly woman of her day; who, "all her life, kept at her own expense
thirteen poor folk wherever she went; who, throughout Lent, watched in
the church at triple matins, namely, one for the Trinity, one for the
Cross, and one for St. Mary; who every day read the Psalter through, and
so persevered in good and holy works to her life's end,"--the "devoted
friend of St. Mary, ever a virgin," who enriched monasteries without
number,--Leominster, Wenlock, Chester, St. Mary's Stow by Lincoln,
Worcester, Evesham; and who, above all, founded the great monastery in
that town of Coventry, which has made her name immortal for another and
a far nobler deed; and enriched it so much "that no monastery in England
possessed such abundance of gold, silver, jewels, and precious stones,"
beside that most precious jewel of all, the arm of St. Augustine, which
not Lady Godiva, but her friend, Archbishop Ethelnoth, presented to
Coventry, "having bought it at Pavia for a hundred talents of silver and
a talent of gold." [Footnote: William of Malmesbury.]

Less known, save to students, is her husband, Leofric the great Earl
of Mercia and Chester, whose bones lie by those of Godiva in that same
minster of Coventry; how "his counsel was as if one had opened the
Divine oracles"; very "wise," says the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, "for
God and for the world, which was a blessing to all this nation"; the
greatest man, save his still greater rival, Earl Godwin, in Edward the
Confessor's court.

Less known, again, are the children of that illustrious pair: Algar,
or Alfgar, Earl of Mercia after his father, who died, after a short and
stormy life, leaving two sons, Edwin and Morcar, the fair and hapless
young earls, always spoken of together, as if they had been twins; a
daughter, Aldytha, or Elfgiva, married first (according to some) to
Griffin, King of North Wales, and certainly afterwards to Harold, King
of England; and another, Lucia (as the Normans at least called her),
whose fate was, if possible, more sad than that of her brothers.

Their second son was Hereward, whose history this tale sets forth; their
third and youngest, a boy whose name is unknown.

They had, probably, another daughter beside; married, it may be, to
some son of Leofric's stanch friend old Siward Biorn, the Viking Earl of
Northumberland, and conqueror of Macbeth; and the mother, may be, of the
two young Siwards, the "white" and the "red," who figure in chronicle
and legend as the nephews of Hereward. But this pedigree is little more
than a conjecture.

Be these things as they may, Godiva was the greatest lady in England,
save two: Edith, Harold's sister, the nominal wife of Edward the
Confessor; and Githa, or Gyda, as her own Danes called her, Harold's
mother, niece of Canute the Great. Great was Godiva; and might have been
proud enough, had she been inclined to that pleasant sin. And even then
(for there is a skeleton, they say, in every house) she carried that
about her which might well keep her humble; namely, shame at the
misconduct of Hereward, her son.

Her favorite residence, among the many manors and "villas," or farms
which Leofric possessed, was neither the stately hall at Loughton by
Bridgenorth, nor the statelier castle of Warwick, but the house of
Bourne in South Lincolnshire, between the great woods of the Bruneswald
and the great level of the fens. It may have been her own paternal
dowry, and have come down to her in right of her Danish ancestors,
and that great and "magnificent" Jarl Oslac, from whom she derived her
all-but-royal blood. This is certain, that Leofric, her husband, went
in East Anglia by the name of Leofric, Lord of Bourne; that, as Domesday
Book testifies, his son Alfgar, and his grandson Morcar, held large
lands there and thereabout. Alfgar's name, indeed, still lives in the
village of Algar-Kirk; and Lady Godiva, and Algar after her, enriched
with great gifts Crowland, the island sanctuary, and Peterborough, where
Brand, either her brother or Leofric's, was a monk, and in due time an
abbot.

The house of Bourne, as far as it can be reconstructed by imagination,
was altogether unlike one of the tall and gloomy Norman castles which
twenty years later reared their evil donjons over England. It was much
more like a house in a Chinese painting; an irregular group of low
buildings, almost all of one story, stone below and timber above, with
high-peaked roofs,--at least in the more Danish country,--affording a
separate room, or rather house, for each different need of the family.
Such a one may be seen in the illuminations of the century. In the
centre of the building is the hall, with door or doors opening out into
the court; and sitting thereat, at the top of a flight of steps, the
lord and lady, dealing clothes to the naked and bread to the hungry. On
one side of the hall is a chapel; by it a large room or "bower" for the
ladies; behind the hall a round tower, seemingly the strong place of
the whole house; on the other side a kitchen; and stuck on to bower,
kitchen, and every other principal building, lean-to after lean-to, the
uses of which it is impossible now to discover. The house had grown with
the wants of the family,--as many good old English houses have done to
this day. Round it would be scattered barns and stables, in which grooms
and herdsmen slept side by side with their own horses and cattle; and
outside all, the "yard," "garth," or garden-fence, high earth-bank with
palisades on top, which formed a strong defence in time of war. Such was
most probably the "villa," "ton," or "town" of Earl Leofric, the Lord
of Bourne, the favorite residence of Godiva,--once most beautiful, and
still most holy, according to the holiness of those old times.

Now on a day--about the year 1054--while Earl Siward was helping to
bring Birnam wood to Dunsinane, to avenge his murdered brother-in-law,
Lady Godiva sat, not at her hall door, dealing food and clothing to
her thirteen poor folk, but in her bower, with her youngest son, a
two-years' boy, at her knee. She was listening with a face of shame and
horror to the complaint of Herluin, Steward of Peterborough, who had
fallen in that afternoon with Hereward and his crew of "housecarles."

To keep a following of stout housecarles, or men-at-arms, was the pride
as well as the duty of an Anglo-Danish Lord, as it was, till lately, of
a Scoto-Danish Highland Laird. And Hereward, in imitation of his father
