thousands. Suddenly in the distance the sound of martial music: and
instantly, quick as the lightning and far more wild, each person present
brandished a flaming torch, amid a chorus of cheers, that, renewed
and resounding, floated far away over the broad bosom of the dusk
wilderness.

The music and the banners denoted the arrival of the leaders of the
people. They mounted the craggy ascent that led to the summit of
the Druid's Altar, and there, surrounded by his companions, amid the
enthusiastic shouts of the multitude, Walter Gerard came forth to
address a TORCH-LIGHT MEETING.

His tall form seemed colossal in the uncertain and flickering light, his
rich and powerful voice reached almost to the utmost limit of his vast
audience, now still with expectation and silent with excitement. Their
fixed and eager glance, the mouth compressed with fierce resolution or
distended by novel sympathy, as they listened to the exposition of their
wrongs, and the vindication of the sacred rights of labour--the shouts
and waving of the torches as some bright or bold phrase touched them to
the quick--the cause, the hour, the scene--all combined to render the
assemblage in a high degree exciting.

"I wonder if Warner will speak to-night," said Dandy Mick to Devilsdust.

"He can't pitch it in like Gerard," replied his companion.

"But he is a trump in the tender," said the Dandy. "The Handlooms looks
to him as their man, and that's a powerful section."

"If you come to the depth of a question, there's nothing like Stephen
Morley," said Devilsdust. "'Twould take six clergymen any day to settle
him. He knows the principles of society by heart. But Gerard gets hold
of the passions."

"And that's the way to do the trick," said Dandy Mick. "I wish he would
say march, and no mistake."

"There is a great deal to do before saying that," said Devilsdust. "We
must have discussion, because when it comes to reasoning, the oligarchs
have not got a leg to stand on; and we must stop the consumption of
exciseable articles, and when they have no tin to pay the bayonets and
their b--y police, they are dished."

"You have a long head, Dusty," said Mick.

"Why I have been thinking of it ever since I knew two and two made
four," said his friend. "I was not ten years old when I said to
myself--It's a pretty go this, that I should be toiling in a shoddy-hole
to pay the taxes for a gentleman what drinks his port wine and stretches
his legs on a Turkey carpet. Hear, hear," he suddenly exclaimed, as
Gerard threw off a stinging sentence. "Ah! that's the man for the
people. You will see, Mick, whatever happens, Gerard is the man who will
always lead."

Gerard had ceased amid enthusiastic plaudits, and Warner--that hand-loom
weaver whom the reader may recollect, and who had since become a popular
leader and one of the principal followers of Gerard--had also addressed
the multitude. They had cheered and shouted, and voted resolutions, and
the business of the night was over. Now they were enjoined to disperse
in order and depart in peace. The band sounded a triumphant retreat; the
leaders had descended from the Druid's Altar; the multitude were melting
away, bearing back to the town their high resolves and panting thoughts,
and echoing in many quarters the suggestive appeals of those who
had addressed them. Dandy Mick and Devilsdust departed together; the
business of their night had not yet commenced, and it was an important
one.

They took their way to that suburb whither Gerard and Morley repaired
the evening of their return from Marney Abbey; but it was not on this
occasion to pay a visit to Chaffing Jack and his brilliant saloon.
Winding through many obscure lanes, Mick and his friend at length turned
into a passage which ended in a square court of a not inconsiderable
size, and which was surrounded by high buildings that had the appearance
of warehouses. Entering one of these, and taking up a dim lamp that
was placed on the stone of an empty hearth, Devilsdust led his friend
through several unoccupied and unfurnished rooms, until he came to one
in which there were some signs of occupation.

"Now, Mick," said he, in a very earnest, almost solemn tone, "are you
firm?"

"All right, my hearty," replied his friend, though not without some
affectation of ease.

"There is a good deal to go through," said Devilsdust. "It tries a man."

"You don't mean that?"

"But if you are firm, all's right. Now I must leave you."

"No, no, Dusty," said Mick.

"I must go," said Devilsdust; "and you must rest here till you are
sent for. Now mind--whatever is bid you, obey; and whatever you see, be
quiet. There," and Devilsdust taking a flask out of his pocket, held it
forth to his friend, "give a good pull, man, I can't leave it you, for
though your heart must be warm, your head must be cool," and so saying
he vanished.

Notwithstanding the animating draught, the heart of Mick Radley
trembled. There are some moments when the nervous system defies even
brandy. Mick was on the eve of a great and solemn incident, round
which for years his imagination had gathered and brooded. Often in that
imagination he had conceived the scene, and successfully confronted its
perils or its trials. Often had the occasion been the drama of many a
triumphant reverie, but the stern presence of reality had dispelled all
his fancy and all his courage. He recalled the warning of Julia, who had
often dissuaded him from the impending step; that warning received with
so much scorn and treated with so much levity. He began to think that
women were always right; that Devilsdust was after all a dangerous
counsellor; he even meditated over the possibility of a retreat. He
looked around him: the glimmering lamp scarcely indicated the outline of
the obscure chamber. It was lofty, nor in the obscurity was it possible
for the eye to reach the ceiling, which several huge beams seemed to
cross transversally, looming in the darkness. There was apparently no
windows, and the door by which they had entered was not easily to
be recognised. Mick had just taken up the lamp and was surveying his
position, when a slight noise startled him, and looking round he beheld
at some little distance two forms which he hoped were human.

Enveloped in dark cloaks and wearing black masks, a conical cap of the
same colour adding to their considerable height, each held a torch. They
stood in silence--two awful sentries.

Their appearance appalled, their stillness terrified, Mick: he remained
with his mouth open and the lamp in his extended arm. At length, unable
any longer to sustain the solemn mystery, and plucking up his natural
audacity, he exclaimed, "I say, what do you want?"

All was silent.

"Come, come," said Mick much alarmed; "none of this sort of thing. I
say, you must speak though."

The figures advanced: they stuck their torches in a niche that was by;
and then they placed each of them a hand on the shoulder of Mick.

"No, no; none of that," said Mick, trying to disembarrass himself.

But, notwithstanding this fresh appeal, one of the silent masks pinioned
his arms; and in a moment the eyes of the helpless friend of Devilsdust
were bandaged.

Conducted by these guides, it seemed to Mick that he was traversing
interminable rooms, or rather galleries, for once stretching out his
arm, while one of his supporters had momentarily quitted him to open
some gate or door, Mick touched a wall. At length one of the masks
spoke, and said, "In five minutes you will be in the presence of the
SEVEN--prepare."

At this moment rose the sound of distant voices singing in concert, and
gradually increasing in volume as Mick and the masks advanced. One of
these attendants now notifying to their charge that he must kneel down,
Mick found he rested on a cushion, while at the same time his arms still
pinioned, he seemed to be left alone.

The voices became louder and louder; Mick could distinguish the words
and burthen of the hymn; he was sensible that many persons were entering
the apartment; he could distinguish the measured tread of some solemn
procession. Round the chamber, more than once, they moved with slow and
awful step. Suddenly that movement ceased; there was a pause of a few
minutes; at length a voice spoke. "I denounce John Briars."

"Why?" said another.

"He offers to take nothing but piece-work; the man who does piece-work
is guilty of less defensible conduct than a drunkard. The worst passions
of our nature are enlisted in support of piece-work. Avarice, meanness,
cunning, hypocrisy, all excite and feed upon the miserable votary who
works by the task and not by the hour. A man who earns by piece-work
forty shillings per week, the usual wages for day-work being twenty,
robs his fellows of a week's employment; therefore I denounce John
Briars."

"Let it go forth," said the other voice; "John Briars is denounced.
If he receive another week's wages by the piece, he shall not have the
option of working the week after for time. No.87, see to John Briars."

"I denounce Claughton and Hicks," said another voice.

"Why?"

"They have removed Gregory Ray from being a superintendent, because he
belonged to this lodge."

"Brethren, is it your pleasure that there shall be a turn out for ten
days at Claughton and Hicks?"

"It is our pleasure," cried several voices.

"No.34, give orders to-morrow that the works at Claughton and Hicks stop
till further orders."

"Brethren," said another voice, "I propose the expulsion from this
Union, of any member who shall be known to boast of his superior
ability, as to either the quantity or quality of work he can do, either
in public or private company. Is it your pleasure?"

"It is our pleasure."

"Brethren," said a voice that seemed a presiding one, "before we proceed
to the receipt of the revenue from the different districts of this
lodge, there is I am informed a stranger present, who prays to be
admitted into our fraternity. Are all robed in the mystic robe? Are all
masked in the secret mask?"

"All

"Then let us pray!" And thereupon after a movement which intimated that
all present were kneeling, the presiding voice offered up an extemporary
prayer of great power and even eloquence. This was succeeded by the
Hymn of Labour, and at its conclusion the arms of the neophyte were
unpinioned, and then his eyes were unbandaged.

Mick found himself in a lofty and spacious room lighted with many
tapers. Its walls were hung with black cloth; at a table covered with
the same material, were seated seven persons in surplices and masked,
the president on a loftier seat; above which on a pedestal was a
skeleton complete. On each side of the skeleton was a man robed and
masked, holding a drawn sword; and on each of Mick was a man in the same
garb holding a battle-axe. On the table was the sacred volume open, and
at a distance, ranged in order on each side of the room, was a row of
persons in white robes and white masks, and holding torches.

"Michael Radley," said the President. "Do you voluntarily swear in
the presence of Almighty God and before these witnesses, that you will
execute with zeal and alacrity, as far as in you lies, every task and
injunction that the majority of your brethren testified by the mandate
of this grand committee, shall impose upon you, in futherance of
our common welfare, of which they are the sole judges; such as the
chastisement of Nobs, the assassination of oppressive and tyrannical
masters, or the demolition of all mills, works and shops that shall be
deemed by us incorrigible. Do you swear this in the presence of Almighty
God and before these witnesses?"

"I do swear it," replied a tremulous voice.

"Then rise and kiss that book."

Mick slowly rose from his kneeling position, advanced with a trembling
step, and bending, embraced with reverence the open volume.

Immediately every one unmasked; Devilsdust came forward, and taking Mick
by the hand led him to the President, who received him pronouncing some
mystic rhymes. He was covered with a robe and presented with a torch,
and then ranged in order with his companions. Thus terminated the
initiation of Dandy Mick into a TRADES UNION.




Book 4 Chapter 5



"His lordship has not yet rung his bell, gentlemen."

It was the valet of Lord Milford that spoke, addressing from the door of
a house in Belgrave Square, about noon, a deputation from the National
Convention, consisting of two of its delegates, who waited on the young
viscount in common with other members of the legislature, in order
to call his particular attention to the National Petition which the
Convention had prepared, and which in the course of the session was to
be presented by one of the members for Birmingham.

"I fear we are too early for these fine birds," said one delegate to the
other. "Who is next on our list?"

"No. 27, -- Street, close by; Mr THOROUGH BASE: he ought to be with the
people, for his father was only a fiddler; but I understand he is quite
an aristocrat and has married a widow of quality."

"Well, knock."

Mr Thorough Base was not at home; had received the card of the delegates
apprising him of the honour of their intended visit, but had made up his
mind on the subject.

No.18 in the same street received them more courteously. Here resided
Mr KREMLIN, who after listening with patience if not with interest,
to their statement, apprised them that forms of government were of no
consequence, and domestic policy of no interest; that there was only
one subject which should engage the attention of public men, because
everything depended on it,--that was our external system; and that the
only specific for a revival of trade and the contentment of the people,
was a general settlement of the boundary questions. Finally, Mr Kremlin
urged upon the National Convention to recast their petition with this
view, assuring them that on foreign policy they would have the public
with them.

The deputation in reply might have referred as an evidence of the
general interest excited by questions of foreign policy, to the
impossibility even of a leader making a house on one; and to the fact
that there are not three men in the House of Commons who even pretend
to have any acquaintance with the external circumstances of the country;
they might have added, that even in such an assembly Mr Kremlin himself
was distinguished for ignorance, for he had only one idea,--and that was
wrong.

Their next visit was to WRIGGLE, a member for a metropolitan district,
a disciple of Progress, who went with the times, but who took particular
good care to ascertain their complexion; and whose movements if
expedient could partake of a regressive character. As the Charter might
some day turn up trumps as well as so many other unexpected cards
and colours, Wriggle gave his adhesion to it, but of course only
provisionally; provided that is to say, he might vote against it at
present. But he saw no harm in it--not he, and should be prepared to
support it when circumstances, that is to say the temper of the times,
would permit him. More could hardly be expected from a gentleman in the
delicate position in which Wriggle found himself at this moment, for he
had solicited a baronetcy of the whigs, and had secretly pledged himself
to Taper to vote against them on the impending Jamaica division.

BOMBASTES RIP snubbed them, which was hard, for he had been one of
themselves, had written confidential letters in 1831 to the secretary of
the Treasury, and "provided his expenses were paid," offered to come up
from the manufacturing town he now represented, at the head of a hundred
thousand men, and burn down Apsley House. But now Bombastes Rip talked
of the great middle class; of public order and public credit. He would
have said more to them, but had an appointment in the city, being a
most active member of the committee for raising a statue to the Duke of
Wellington.

FLOATWELL received them in the politest manner, though he did not agree
with them. What he did agree with was difficult to say. Clever, brisk,
and bustling, with an university reputation and without patrimony,
Floatwell shrunk from the toils of a profession, and in the hurry skurry
of reform found himself to his astonishment a parliament man. There he
had remained, but why, the Fates alone knew. The fun of such a thing
must have evaporated with the novelty. Floatwell had entered public life
in complete ignorance of every subject which could possibly engage
the attention of a public man. He knew nothing of history, national or
constitutional law, had indeed none but puerile acquirements, and
had seen nothing of life. Assiduous at committees he gained those
superficial habits of business which are competent to the conduct of
ordinary affairs, and picked up in time some of the slang of economical
questions. Floatwell began at once with a little success, and he kept
his little success; nobody envied him it; he hoarded his sixpences
without exciting any evil emulation. He was one of those characters who
above all things shrink from isolation, and who imagine they are getting
on if they are keeping company with some who stick like themselves. He
was always an idolater of some great personage who was on the shelf,
and who he was convinced, because the great personage assured him of
it after dinner, would sooner or later turn out the man. At present,
Floatwell swore by Lord Dunderhead; and the game of this little coterie,
who dined together and thought they were a party, was to be courteous to
the Convention.

After the endurance of an almost interminable lecture on the currency
from Mr KITE, who would pledge himself to the charter if the charter
would pledge itself to one-pound notes, the two delegates had arrived in
Piccadilly, and the next member upon their list was Lord Valentine.

"It is two o'clock," said one of the delegates, "I think we may
venture;" so they knocked at the portal of the court yard, and found
they were awaited.

A private staircase led to the suite of rooms of Lord Valentine, who
lived in the family mansion. The delegates were ushered through
an ante-chamber into a saloon which opened into a very fanciful
conservatory, where amid tall tropical plants played a fountain. The
saloon was hung with blue satin, and adorned with brilliant mirrors: its
coved ceiling was richly painted, and its furniture became the rest of
its decorations. On one sofa were a number of portfolios, some open,
full of drawings of costumes; a table of pietra dura was covered with
richly bound volumes that appeared to have been recently referred to;
several ancient swords of extreme beauty were lying on a couch; in
a corner of the room was a figure in complete armour, black and gold
richly inlaid, and grasping in its gauntlet the ancient standard of
England.

The two delegates of the National Convention stared at each other, as
if to express their surprise that a dweller in such an abode should ever
have permitted them to enter it; but ere either of them could venture to
speak, Lord Valentine made his appearance.

He was a young man, above the middle height, slender, broad-shouldered,
small-waisted, of a graceful presence; he was very fair, with dark blue
eyes, bright and intelligent, and features of classic precision; a small
Greek cap crowned his long light-brown hair, and he was enveloped in a
morning robe of Indian shawls.

"Well, gentlemen," said his lordship, as he invited them to be seated,
in a clear and cheerful voice, and with an unaffected tone of frankness
which put his guests at their ease; "I promised to see you; well, what
have you got to say?"

The delegates made their accustomed statement; they wished to pledge no
one; all that the people desired was a respectful discussion of their
claims; the national petition, signed by nearly a million and a half of
the flower of the working classes, was shortly to be presented to the
House of Commons, praying the House to take into consideration the
five points in which the working classes deemed their best interests
involved; to wit, universal suffrage, vote by ballot, annual
parliaments, salaried members, and the abolition of the property
qualification.

"And supposing these five points conceded," said Lord Valentine, "what
do you mean to do?"

"The people then being at length really represented," replied one of the
delegates, "they would decide upon the measures which the interests of
the great majority require."

"I am not so clear about that," said Lord Valentine; "that is the very
point at issue. I do not think the great majority are the best judges of
their own interests. At all events, gentlemen, the respective advantages
of aristocracy and democracy are a moot point. Well then, finding the
question practically settled in this country, you will excuse me for not
wishing to agitate it. I give you complete credit for the sincerity of
your convictions; extend the same confidence to me. You are democrats;
I am an aristocrat. My family has been ennobled for nearly three
centuries; they bore a knightly name before their elevation. They have
mainly and materially assisted in making England what it is. They have
shed their blood in many battles; I have had two ancestors killed in the
command of our fleets. You will not underrate such services, even if you
do not appreciate their conduct as statesmen, though that has often been
laborious, and sometimes distinguished. The finest trees in England
were planted by my family; they raised several of your most beautiful
churches; they have built bridges, made roads, dug mines, and
constructed canals, and drained a marsh of a million of acres which
bears our name to this day, and is now one of the most flourishing
portions of the country. You talk of our taxation and our wars; and of
your inventions and your industry. Our wars converted an island into
an empire, and at any rate developed that industry and stimulated those
inventions of which you boast. You tell me that you are the delegates
of the unrepresented working classes of Mowbray. Why, what would Mowbray
have been if it had not been for your aristocracy and their wars? Your
town would not have existed; there would have been no working classes
there to send up delegates. In fact you owe your every existence to
us. I have told you what my ancestors have done; I am prepared, if the
occasion requires it, not to disgrace them; I have inherited their great
position, and I tell you fairly, gentlemen, I will not relinquish it
without a struggle."

"Will you combat the people in that suit of armour, my lord?" said one
of the delegates smiling, but in a tone of kindness and respect.

"That suit of armour has combated for the people before this," said Lord
Valentine, "for it stood by Simon de Montfort on the field of Evesham."

"My lord," said the other delegate, "it is well known that you come from
a great and honoured race; and we have seen enough to-day to show that
in intelligence and spirit you are not unworthy of your ancestry. But
the great question, which your lordship has introduced, not us, is not
to be decided by a happy instance. Your ancestors may have done great
things. What wonder! They were members of a very limited class which had
the monopoly of action. And the people, have not they shed their blood
in battle, though they may have commanded fleets less often than your
lordship's relatives? And these mines and canals that you have excavated
and constructed, these woods you have planted, these waters you have
drained--had the people no hand in these creations? What share in these
great works had that faculty of Labour whose sacred claims we now urge,
but which for centuries have been passed over in contemptuous silence?
No, my lord, we call upon you to decide this question by the result.
The Aristocracy of England have had for three centuries the exercise
of power; for the last century and a half that exercise has been
uncontrolled; they form at this moment the most prosperous class that
the history of the world can furnish: as rich as the Roman senators,
with sources of convenience and enjoyment which modern science could
alone supply. All this is not denied. Your order stands before Europe
the most gorgeous of existing spectacles; though you have of late years
dexterously thrown some of the odium of your polity upon that middle
class which you despise, and who are despicable only because they
imitate you, your tenure of power is not in reality impaired. You govern
us still with absolute authority--and you govern the most miserable
people on the face of the globe."

"And is this a fair description of the people of England?" said Lord
Valentine. "A flash of rhetoric, I presume, that would place them lower
than the Portuguese or the Poles, the serfs of Russia or the Lazzaroni
of Naples."

"Infinitely lower," said the delegate, "for they are not only degraded,
but conscious of their degradation. They no longer believe in any
innate difference between the governing and the governed classes of this
country. They are sufficiently enlightened to feel they are victims.
Compared with the privileged classes of their own land, they are in
a lower state than any other population compared with its privileged
classes. All is relative, my lord, and believe me, the relations of the
working classes of England to its privileged orders are relations of
enmity, and therefore of peril."

"The people must have leaders," said Lord Valentine.

"And they have found them," said the delegate.

"When it comes to a push they will follow their nobility," said Lord
Valentine.

"Will their nobility lead them?" said the other delegate. "For my part
I do not pretend to be a philosopher, and if I saw a Simon de Montfort
again I should be content to fight under his banner."

"We have an aristocracy of wealth," said the delegate who had chiefly
spoken. "In a progressive civilization wealth is the only means of class
distinction: but a new disposition of wealth may remove even this."

"Ah! you want to get at our estates," said Lord Valentine smiling; "but
the effort on your part may resolve society into its original elements,
and the old sources of distinction may again develope themselves."

"Tall barons will not stand against Paixhans rockets," said the
delegate. "Modern science has vindicated the natural equality of man."

"And I must say I am very sorry for it," said the other delegate;
"for human strength always seems to me the natural process of settling
affairs."

"I am not surprised at your opinion," said Lord Valentine, turning to
the delegate and smiling. "I should not be over-glad to meet you in a
fray. You stand some inches above six feet, or I am mistaken."

"I was six feet two inches when I stopped growing," said the delegate;
"and age has not stolen any of my height yet."

"That suit of armour would fit you," said Lord Valentine, as they all
rose.

"And might I ask your lordship," said the tall delegate, "why it is
here?"

"I am to represent Richard Coeur de Lion at the Queen's ball," said Lord
Valentine; "and before my sovereign I will not don a Drury-Lane cuirass,
so I got this up from my father's castle."

"Ah! I almost wish the good old times of Coeur de Lion were here again,"
said the tall delegate.

"And we should be serfs," said his companion.

"I am not sure of that," said the tall delegate. "At any rate there was
the free forest."

"I like that young fellow," said the tall delegate to his companion, as
they descended the staircase.

"He has awful prejudices," said his friend.

"Well, well; he has his opinions and we have ours. But he is a man;
with clear, straightforward ideas, a frank, noble, presence; and as
good-looking a fellow as I ever set eyes on. Where are we now?"

"We have only one more name on our list to-day, and it is at hand.
Letter K, No.1, Albany. Another member of the aristocracy, the
Honourable Charles Egremont."

"Well, I prefer them, as far as I can judge, to Wriggle, and Rip, and
Thorough Base," said the tall delegate laughing. "I dare say we should
have found Lord Milford a very jolly fellow, if he had only been up."

"Here we are," said his companion, as he knocked. "Mr Egremont, is he at
home?"

"The gentlemen of the deputation? Yes, my master gave particular orders
that he was at home to you. Will you walk in, gentlemen?"

"There you see," said the tall delegate. "This would be a lesson to
Thorough Base."

They sat down in an antechamber: the servant opened a mahogany
folding-door which he shut after him and announced to his master the
arrival of the delegates. Egremont was seated in his library, at a round
table covered with writing materials, books, and letters. On another
table were arranged his parliamentary papers, and piles of blue books.
The room was classically furnished. On the mantelpiece were some ancient
vases, which he had brought with him from Italy, standing on each side
of that picture of Allori of which we have spoken.

The servant returned to the ante-room, and announcing to the delegates
that his master was ready to receive them, ushered into the presence of
Egremont--WALTER GERARD and STEPHEN MORLEY.




Book 4 Chapter 6



It is much to be deplored that our sacred buildings are generally closed
except at the stated periods of public resort. It is still more to be
regretted that when with difficulty entered, there is so much in their
arrangements to offend the taste and outrage the feelings. In the tumult
of life, a few minutes occasionally passed in the solemn shadow of some
lofty and ancient aisle, exercise very often a salutary influence: they
purify the heart and elevate the mind; dispel many haunting fancies, and
prevent many an act which otherwise might be repented. The church would
in this light still afford us a sanctuary; not against the power of the
law but against the violence of our own will; not against the passions
of man but against our own.

The Abbey of Westminster rises amid the strife of factions. Around its
consecrated precinct some of the boldest and some of the worst deeds
have been achieved or perpetrated: sacrilege, rapine, murder, and
treason. Here robbery has been practised on the greatest scale known
in modern ages: here ten thousand manors belonging to the order of the
Templars, without any proof, scarcely with a pretext, were forfeited
in one day and divided among the monarch and his chief nobles; here
the great estate of the church, which, whatever its articles of faith,
belonged and still belongs to the people, was seized at various times,
under various pretences, by an assembly that continually changed the
religion of their country and their own by a parliamentary majority,
but which never refunded the booty. Here too was brought forth that
monstrous conception which even patrician Rome in its most ruthless
period never equalled--the mortgaging of the industry of the country
to enrich and to protect property; an act which is now bringing its
retributive consequences in a degraded and alienated population. Here
too have the innocent been impeached and hunted to death; and a virtuous
