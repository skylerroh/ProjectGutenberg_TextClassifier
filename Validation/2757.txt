     In Echo's many-toned diurnal shell.

     The Eolian Harp, and mingle all its strings;
     Or trill in air the soft symphonious chime,
     When rapt CECILIA lifts her eye sublime,
     Swell, as she breathes, her bosoms rising snow,

     Calls the red tempest round the guilty head,

     From Ashur's vales when proud SENACHERIB trod,
     Pour'd his swoln heart, defied the living GOD,
     Urged with incessant shouts his glittering powers;
270  And JUDAH shook through all her massy towers;
     Round her sad altars press'd the prostrate crowd,
     Hosts beat their breasts, and suppliant chieftains bow'd;
     Loud shrieks of matrons thrill'd the troubled air,
     And trembling virgins rent their scatter'd hair;
275  High in the midst the kneeling King adored,
     Spread the blaspheming scroll before the Lord,
     Raised his pale hands, and breathed his pausing sighs,
     And fixed on Heaven his dim imploring eyes,--

290  "And teach the trembling nations, "THOU ART GOD!"--
     --SYLPHS! in what dread array with pennons broad
     Onward ye floated o'er the ethereal road,
     Call'd each dank steam the reeking marsh exhales,
     Contagious vapours, and volcanic gales,
295  Gave the soft South with poisonous breath to blow,
     And rolled the dreadful whirlwind on the foe!--
     Hark! o'er the camp the venom'd tempest sings,
     Man falls on Man, on buckler buckler rings;
     Groan answers groan, to anguish anguish yields,

     --High rears the Fiend his grinning jaws, and wide
     Spans the pale nations with colossal stride,
     Waves his broad falchion with uplifted hand,
     And his vast shadow darkens all the land.


[_Volcanic gales_. l. 294. The pestilential winds of the east are
described by various authors under various denominations; as harmattan,
samiel, samium, syrocca, kamsin, seravansum. M. de Beauchamp describes a
remarkable south wind in the deserts about Bagdad, called seravansum, or
poison-wind; it burns the face, impedes respiration, strips the trees of
their leaves, and is said to pass on in a streight line, and often kills
people in six hours. P. Cotte sur la Meteorol. Analytical Review for
February, 1790. M. Volney says, the hot wind or ramsin seems to blow at
the season when the sands of the deserts are the hottest; the air is
then filled with an extreamly subtle dust. Vol. I. p. 61. These winds
blow in all directions from the deserts; in Egypt the most violent
proceed from the S.S.W. at Mecca from the E. at Surat from the N. at
Bassora from the N.W. at Bagdad from the W. and in Syria from the S.E.

On the south of Syria, he adds, where the Jordan flows is a country of
volcanos; and it is observed that the earthquakes in Syria happen after
their rainy season, which is also conformable to a similar observation
made by Dr. Shaw in Barbary. Travels in Egypt, Vol. I. p. 303.

These winds seem all to be of volcanic origin, as before mentioned, with
this difference, that the Simoom is attended with a stream of electric
matter; they seem to be in consequence of earthquakes caused by the
monsoon floods, which fall on volcanic fires in Syria, at the same time
that they inundate the Nile.]


305    IX. 1. "Ethereal cohorts! Essences of Air!
     Make the green children of the Spring your care!
     Oh, SYLPHS! disclose in this inquiring age
     One GOLDEN SECRET to some favour'd sage;
     Grant the charm'd talisman, the chain, that binds,
310  Or guides the changeful pinions of the winds!
     --No more shall hoary Boreas, issuing forth
     With Eurus, lead the tempests of the North;
     Rime the pale Dawn, or veil'd in flaky showers
     Chill the sweet bosoms of the smiling Hours.
315  By whispering Auster waked shall Zephyr rise,
     Meet with soft kiss, and mingle in the skies,
     Fan the gay floret, bend the yellow ear,
     And rock the uncurtain'd cradle of the year;
     Autumn and Spring in lively union blend,
320  And from the skies the Golden Age descend.


[_One golden secret_. l. 308. The suddenness of the change of the wind
from N.E. to S.W. seems to shew that it depends on some minute chemical
cause; which if it was discovered might probably, like other chemical
causes, be governed by human agency; such as blowing up rocks by
gunpowder, or extracting the lightening from the clouds. If this could
be accomplished, it would be the most happy discovery that ever has
happened to these northern latitudes, since in this country the N.E.
winds bring frost, and the S.W. ones are attended with warmth and
moisture; if the inferior currents of air could be kept perpetually from
the S.W. supplied by new productions of air at the line, or by superior
currents flowing in a contrary direction, the vegetation of this country
would be doubled; as in the moist vallies of Africa, which know no
frost; the number of its inhabitants would be increased, and their lives
prolonged; as great abundance of the aged and infirm of mankind, as well
as many birds and animals, are destroyed by severe continued frosts in
this climate.]


       2. "Castled on ice, beneath the circling Bear,
     A vast CAMELION spits and swallows air;
     O'er twelve degrees his ribs gigantic bend,
     And many a league his leathern jaws extend;
325  Half-fish, beneath, his scaly volutes spread,
     And vegetable plumage crests his head;
     Huge fields of air his wrinkled skin receives,
     From panting gills, wide lungs, and waving leaves;
     Then with dread throes subsides his bloated form,
330  His shriek the thunder, and his sigh the storm.
     Oft high in heaven the hissing Demon wins
     His towering course, upborne on winnowing fins;
     Steers with expanded eye and gaping mouth,
     His mass enormous to the affrighted South;
335  Spreads o'er the shuddering Line his shadowy limbs,
     And Frost and Famine follow as he swims.--
     SYLPHS! round his cloud-built couch your bands array,
     And mould the Monster to your gentle sway;
     Charm with soft tones, with tender touches check,
340  Bend to your golden yoke his willing neck,
     With silver curb his yielding teeth restrain,
     And give to KIRWAN'S hand the silken rein.
     --Pleased shall the Sage, the dragon-wings between,
     Bend o'er discordant climes his eye serene,
345  With Lapland breezes cool Arabian vales,
     And call to Hindostan antarctic gales,
     Adorn with wreathed ears Kampschatca's brows,

[_To Kirwan's hand_. l. 342. Mr. Kirwan has published a valuable
treatise on the temperature of climates, as a step towards investigating
the theory of the winds; and has since written some ingenious papers on
this subject in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Society.]


       X. 1. "SYLPHS! as you hover on ethereal wing,
     Brood the green children of parturient Spring!--
     Where in their bursting cells my Embryons rest,
     I charge you guard the vegetable nest;
355  Count with nice eye the myriad SEEDS, that swell
     Each vaulted womb of husk, or pod, or shell;
     Feed with sweet juices, clothe with downy hair,
     Or hang, inshrined, their little orbs in air.


[_The myriad seeds_. l. 355. Nature would seem to have been wonderfully
prodigal in the seeds of vegetables, and the spawn of fish; almost any
one plant, if all its seeds should grow to maturity, would in a few
years alone people the terrestrial globe. Mr. Ray asserts that 101
seeds of tobacco weighed only one grain, and that from one tobacco plant
the seeds thus calculated amounted to 360,000! The seeds of the ferns
are by him supposed to exceed a million on a leaf. As the works of
nature are governed by general laws this exuberant reproduction prevents
the accidental extinction of the species, at the same time that they
serve for food for the higher orders of animation.

Every seed possesses a reservoir of nutriment designed for the growth of
the future plant, this consists of starch, mucilage, or oil, within the
coat of the seed, or of sugar and subacid pulp in the fruits, which
belongs to it.

For the preservation of the immature seed nature has used many ingenious
methods; some are wrapped in down, as the seeds of the rose, bean, and
cotton-plant; others are suspended in a large air-vessel, as those of
the bladder-sena, staphylaea, and pea.]


       "So, late descry'd by HERSCHEL'S piercing sight,
360  Hang the bright squadrons of the twinkling Night;
     Ten thousand marshall'd stars, a silver zone,

     Suns call to suns, in lucid clouds conspire,
     And light exterior skies with golden fire;
365  Resistless rolls the illimitable sphere,
     And one great circle forms the unmeasured year.
     --Roll on, YE STARS! exult in youthful prime,
     Mark with bright curves the printless steps of Time;
     Near and more near your beamy cars approach,
370  And lessening orbs on lessening orbs encroach;--
     Flowers of the sky! ye too to age must yield,
     Frail as your silken sisters of the field!

375  Headlong, extinct, to one dark centre fall,
     And Death and Night and Chaos mingle all!
     --Till o'er the wreck, emerging from the storm,
     Immortal NATURE lifts her changeful form,

Mr. Ferber speaks of the pleasure he received in observing in the buds

440  And swarthy Memphis trembles and adores.


[_Teach the fine seed_. l. 411. The seeds in their natural state fall on
the surface of the earth, and having absorbed some moisture the root
shoots itself downwards into the earth and the plume rises in air. Thus
each endeavouring to seek its proper pabulum directed by a vegetable
irritability similar to that of the lacteal system and to the lungs in
animals.

The pith seems to push up or elongate the bud by its elasticity, like
the pith in the callow quills of birds. This medulla Linneus believes to
consist of a bundle of fibres, which diverging breaks through the bark
yet gelatinous producing the buds.

The lobes are reservoirs of prepared nutriment for the young seed, which
is absorbed by its placental vessels, and converted into sugar, till it
has penetrated with its roots far enough into the earth to extract
sufficient moisture, and has acquired leaves to convert it into
nourishment. In some plants these lobes rise from the earth and supply
the place of leaves, as in kidney-beans, cucumbers, and hence seem to
serve both as a placenta to the foetus, and lungs to the young plant.
During the process of germination the starch of the seed is converted
into sugar, as is seen in the process of malting barley for the purpose
of brewing. And is on this account very similar to the digestion of food
in the stomachs of animals, which converts all their aliment into a
chyle, which consists of mucilage, oil, and sugar; the placentation of
buds will be spoken of hereafter.]

[_The silvery sap_. l. 419. See additional notes, No. XXXVI.]

[_Or drink the golden_. l. 422. Linneus having observed the great
influence of light on vegetation, imagined that the leaves of plants
inhaled electric matter from the light with their upper surface. (System
of Vegetables translated, p. 8.)

The effect of light on plants occasions the actions of the vegetable
muscles of their leaf-stalks, which turn the upper side of the leaf to
the light, and which open their calyxes and chorols, according to the
experiments of Abbe Tessier, who exposed variety of plants in a cavern
to different quantities of light. Hist. de L'Academie Royal. Ann. 1783.
The sleep or vigilance of plants seems owing to the presence or absence
of this stimulus. See note on Nimosa, Vol. II.]

[_Love out their hour_. l. 456. The vegetable passion of love is
agreeably seen in the flower of the parnassia, in which the males
alternately approach and recede from the female, and in the flower of
nigella, or devil in the bush, in which the tall females bend down to
their dwarf husbands. But I was this morning surprised to observe,
amongst Sir Brooke Boothby's valuable collection of plants at Ashbourn,
the manifest adultery of several females of the plant Collinsonia, who
had bent themselves into contact with the males of other flowers of the
same plant in their vicinity, neglectful of their own. Sept. 16. See
additional notes, No. XXXVIII.]

[_Unfolds his larva-form_. l. 458. The flower bursts forth from its
larva, the herb, naked and perfect like a butterfly from its chrysolis;
winged with its corol; wing-sheathed by its calyx; consisting alone of
the organs of reproduction. The males, or stamens, have their anthers
replete with a prolific powder containing the vivifying fovilla: in the
females, or pistils, exists the ovary, terminated by the tubular stigma.
When the anthers burst and shed their bags of dust, the male fovilla is
received by the prolific lymph of the stigma, and produces the seed or
egg, which is nourished in the ovary. System of Vegetables translated
from Linneus by the Lichfield Society, p. 10.]
