THE GUARDIANS

BY IRVING COX, JR.


_It's not always "The Truth shall set you free!"
Sometimes it's "Want of the Truth shall drive
you to escape!" And that can be dangerous!_

Illustrated by van Dongen




Mryna Brill intended to ride the god-car above the rain mist. For a long
time she had not believed in the taboos or the Earth-god. She no longer
believed she lived on Earth. This paradise of green-floored forests and
running brooks was something called Rythar.

Six years ago, when Mryna was fourteen, she first discovered the truth.
She asked a question and the Earth-god ignored it. A simple question,
really: What is above the rain mist? God could have told her. Every day
he answered technical questions that were far more difficult. Instead,
he repeated the familiar taboo about avoiding the Old Village because of
the Sickness.

And consequently Mryna, being female, went to the Old Village. There was
nothing really unusual about that. All the kids went through the ruins
from time to time. They had worked out a sort of charm that made it all
right. They ran past the burned out shells of the old houses and they
kept their eyes shaded to ward off the Sickness.

But even at fourteen Mryna had outgrown charms and she didn't believe in
the Sickness. She had once asked the Earth-god what sickness meant, and
the screen in the answer house had given her a very detailed answer.
Mryna knew that none of the hundred girls and thirty boys inhabiting
Rythar had ever been sick. That, like the taboo of the Old Village, she
considered a childish superstition.

The Old Village wasn't large--three parallel roads, a mile long, lined
with the charred ruins of prefabs, which were exactly like the cottages
where the kids lived. It was nothing to inspire either fear or legend.
The village had burned a long time ago; the grass from the forest had
grown a green mantle over the skeletal walls.

For weeks Mryna poked through the ruins before she found anything of
significance--a few, scorched pages of a printed pamphlet buried deep in
the black earth. The paper excited her tremendously. It was different
from the film books photographed in the answer house. She had never
touched anything like it; and it seemed wonderful stuff.

She read the pamphlet eagerly. It was part of a promotional
advertisement of a world called Rythar, "the jewel of the Sirian Solar
System."

The description made it obvious that Rythar was the green paradise where
Mryna lived--the place she had been taught to call Earth. And the
pamphlet had been addressed to "Earthmen everywhere."


Mryna made her second find when she was fifteen, a textbook in
astronomy. For the first time in her life she read about the spinning
dust of the universe lying beyond the eternal rain mist that hid her
world.
