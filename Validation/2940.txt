          _It's well established now that the way you put a question
           often determines not only the answer you'll get, but the
           type of answer possible. So ... a mechanical answerer,
           geared to produce the ultimate revelations in reference to
           anything you want to know, might have unsuspected
           limitations._

simple.

Answerer knew that he was as he should be. Above and beyond all else,
he was The Answerer. He Knew.

Of the race that built him, the less said the better. They also Knew,
and never said whether they found the knowledge pleasant.

They built Answerer as a service to less-sophisticated races, and
departed in a unique manner. Where they went only Answerer knows.

Because Answerer knows everything.

Upon his planet, circling his sun, Answerer sat. Duration continued,
long, as some judge duration, short as others judge it. But as it
should be, to Answerer.

Within him were the Answers. He knew the nature of things, and why
things are as they are, and what they are, and what it all means.

Answerer could answer anything, provided it was a legitimate question.
And he wanted to! He was eager to!
