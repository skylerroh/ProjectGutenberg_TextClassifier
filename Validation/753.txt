    At a Yearly Meeting of Friends held in Philadelphia from the 20th of
    the Fourth Month to the 24th of the same, inclusive, 1885.

    An Essay on Singing and Music contained in the Minutes of the
    Meeting for Sufferings was now read, setting forth the spiritual
    nature of true worship, the danger of depending on outward forms in
    religious meetings, and the disadvantages connected with the
    practice of singing and music as an amusement. Much unity was
    expressed with the essay, and it was concluded that it should be
    published and distributed for information and warning to our own
    members and others. Desires were felt that in thus issuing a renewed
    testimony to the principles of our Society, we may be individually
    aroused to the necessity of so living in communion with the Father
    of Spirits, and in subjection to the revelations of his Light in our
    hearts, that our meetings may truly be held under the overshadowing
    of the Divine Power.

    Taken from the Minutes.

We have been brought under a feeling of religious concern that the
ancient testimony of the Society of Friends to the true nature of
spiritual worship may be fully maintained by all who claim that name;
and that they may be watchful against the introduction of practices
which will undermine the support of this testimony, and thus lead
