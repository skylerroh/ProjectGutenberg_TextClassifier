{FN16-6} The Hindu scriptures place the present world-age as
occurring within the KALI YUGA of a much longer universal cycle than
the simple 24,000-year equinoctial cycle with which Sri Yukteswar
was concerned.  The universal cycle of the scriptures is 4,300,560,000
years in extent, and measures out a Day of Creation or the length
of life assigned to our planetary system in its present form. This
vast figure given by the rishis is based on a relationship between
the length of the solar year and a multiple of Pi (3.1416, the
ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle).

The life span for a whole universe, according to the ancient seers,
is 314,159,000,000,000 solar years, or "One Age of Brahma."

Scientists estimate the present age of the earth to be about two
billion years, basing their conclusions on a study of lead pockets
left as a result of radioactivity in rocks. The Hindu scriptures
declare that an earth such as ours is dissolved for one of two
reasons: the inhabitants as a whole become either completely good
or completely evil. The world-mind thus generates a power which
releases the captive atoms held together as an earth.

Dire pronouncements are occasionally published regarding an imminent
"end of the world." The latest prediction of doom was given by Rev.
Chas. G. Long of Pasadena, who publicly set the "Day of Judgment"
for Sept. 21, 1945. UNITED PRESS reporters asked my opinion; I
explained that world cycles follow an orderly progression according
to a divine plan. No earthly dissolution is in sight; two billion
years of ascending and descending equinoctial cycles are yet
in store for our planet in its present form. The figures given by
the rishis for the various world ages deserve careful study in the
West; the magazine TIME (Dec. 17, 1945, p. 6) called them "reassuring
statistics."

from whence he was taken."-GEN. 3:23. The divine man first made
by God had his consciousness centered in the omnipotent single eye
in the forehead (eastward). The all-creative powers of his will,
focused at that spot, were lost to man when he began to "till the
ground" of his physical nature.



CHAPTER: 17

SASI AND THE THREE SAPPHIRES

"Because you and my son think so highly of Swami Sri Yukteswar,
I will take a look at him." The tone of voice used by Dr. Narayan
Chunder Roy implied that he was humoring the whim of half-wits. I
concealed my indignation, in the best traditions of the proselyter.

My companion, a veterinary surgeon, was a confirmed agnostic. His
young son Santosh had implored me to take an interest in his father.
So far my invaluable aid had been a bit on the invisible side.

Dr. Roy accompanied me the following day to the Serampore hermitage.
After Master had granted him a brief interview, marked for the most
part by stoic silence on both sides, the visitor brusquely departed.

"Why bring a dead man to the ashram?" Sri Yukteswar looked at me
inquiringly as soon as the door had closed on the Calcutta skeptic.

"Sir! The doctor is very much alive!"

"But in a short time he will be dead."

I was shocked. "Sir, this will be a terrible blow to his son. Santosh
yet hopes for time to change his father's materialistic views. I
beseech you, Master, to help the man."

"Very well; for your sake." My guru's face was impassive. "The
proud horse doctor is far gone in diabetes, although he does not
know it. In fifteen days he will take to his bed. The physicians
will give him up for lost; his natural time to leave this earth is
six weeks from today. Due to your intercession, however, on that
date he will recover. But there is one condition. You must get
him to wear an astrological bangle; he will doubtless object as
violently as one of his horses before an operation!" Master chuckled.

After a silence, during which I wondered how Santosh and I could
best employ the arts of cajolery on the recalcitrant doctor, Sri
Yukteswar made further disclosures.

"As soon as the man gets well, advise him not to eat meat. He will
not heed this counsel, however, and in six months, just as he is
feeling at his best, he will drop dead. Even that six-month extension
of life is granted him only because of your plea."

The following day I suggested to Santosh that he order an armlet
at the jeweler's. It was ready in a week, but Dr. Roy refused to
put it on.

"I am in the best of health. You will never impress me with these
astrological superstitions." The doctor glanced at me belligerently.

I recalled with amusement that Master had justifiably compared
the man to a balky horse. Another seven days passed; the doctor,
suddenly ill, meekly consented to wear the bangle. Two weeks later
the physician in attendance told me that his patient's case was
hopeless. He supplied harrowing details of the ravages inflicted
by diabetes.

I shook my head. "My guru has said that, after a sickness lasting
one month, Dr. Roy will be well."

The physician stared at me incredulously. But he sought me out a
fortnight later, with an apologetic air.

"Dr. Roy has made a complete recovery!" he exclaimed. "It is the
most amazing case in my experience. Never before have I seen a dying
man show such an inexplicable comeback. Your guru must indeed be
a healing prophet!"

After one interview with Dr. Roy, during which I repeated Sri
Yukteswar's advice about a meatless diet, I did not see the man
again for six months. He stopped for a chat one evening as I sat
on the piazza of my family home on Gurpar Road.

"Tell your teacher that by eating meat frequently, I have wholly
regained my strength. His unscientific ideas on diet have not
influenced me." It was true that Dr. Roy looked a picture of health.

But the next day Santosh came running to me from his home on the
next block. "This morning Father dropped dead!"

This case was one of my strangest experiences with Master. He
healed the rebellious veterinary surgeon in spite of his disbelief,
and extended the man's natural term on earth by six months, just
because of my earnest supplication. Sri Yukteswar was boundless in
his kindness when confronted by the urgent prayer of a devotee.

It was my proudest privilege to bring college friends to meet my
guru.  Many of them would lay aside-at least in the ashram!-their
fashionable academic cloak of religious skepticism.

One of my friends, Sasi, spent a number of happy week ends in
Serampore. Master became immensely fond of the boy, and lamented
that his private life was wild and disorderly.

"Sasi, unless you reform, one year hence you will be dangerously
ill." Sri Yukteswar gazed at my friend with affectionate exasperation.
"Mukunda is the witness: don't say later that I didn't warn you."

Sasi laughed. "Master, I will leave it to you to interest a sweet
charity of cosmos in my own sad case! My spirit is willing but my
will is weak. You are my only savior on earth; I believe in nothing
else."

"At least you should wear a two-carat blue sapphire. It will help
you."

"I can't afford one. Anyhow, dear guruji, if trouble comes, I fully
believe you will protect me."

"In a year you will bring three sapphires," Sri Yukteswar replied
cryptically. "They will be of no use then."

Variations on this conversation took place regularly. "I can't
reform!" Sasi would say in comical despair. "And my trust in you,
Master, is more precious to me than any stone!"

A year later I was visiting my guru at the Calcutta home of his
disciple, Naren Babu. About ten o'clock in the morning, as Sri
Yukteswar and I were sitting quietly in the second-floor parlor,
I heard the front door open. Master straightened stiffly.

"It is that Sasi," he remarked gravely. "The year is now up; both
his lungs are gone. He has ignored my counsel; tell him I don't
want to see him."

Half stunned by Sri Yukteswar's sternness, I raced down the stairway.
Sasi was ascending.

"O Mukunda! I do hope Master is here; I had a hunch he might be."

"Yes, but he doesn't wish to be disturbed."

Sasi burst into tears and brushed past me. He threw himself at Sri
Yukteswar's feet, placing there three beautiful sapphires.

"Omniscient guru, the doctors say I have galloping tuberculosis!
They give me no longer than three more months! I humbly implore
your aid; I know you can heal me!"

"Isn't it a bit late now to be worrying over your life? Depart
with your jewels; their time of usefulness is past." Master then
sat sphinxlike in an unrelenting silence, punctuated by the boy's
sobs for mercy.

An intuitive conviction came to me that Sri Yukteswar was merely
testing the depth of Sasi's faith in the divine healing power. I was
not surprised a tense hour later when Master turned a sympathetic
gaze on my prostrate friend.

"Get up, Sasi; what a commotion you make in other people's houses!
Return your sapphires to the jeweler's; they are an unnecessary
expense now. But get an astrological bangle and wear it. Fear not;
in a few weeks you shall be well."

Sasi's smile illumined his tear-marred face like sudden sun over
a sodden landscape. "Beloved guru, shall I take the medicines
prescribed by the doctors?"

Sri Yukteswar's glance was longanimous. "Just as you wish-drink
them or discard them; it does not matter. It is more possible for
the sun and moon to interchange their positions than for you to
die of tuberculosis." He added abruptly, "Go now, before I change
my mind!"

With an agitated bow, my friend hastily departed. I visited him
several times during the next few weeks, and was aghast to find
his condition increasingly worse.

"Sasi cannot last through the night." These words from his physician,
and the spectacle of my friend, now reduced almost to a skeleton,
sent me posthaste to Serampore. My guru listened coldly to my
tearful report.

"Why do you come here to bother me? You have already heard me assure
Sasi of his recovery."

I bowed before him in great awe, and retreated to the door. Sri
Yukteswar said no parting word, but sank into silence, his unwinking
eyes half-open, their vision fled to another world.

I returned at once to Sasi's home in Calcutta. With astonishment
I found my friend sitting up, drinking milk.

"O Mukunda! What a miracle! Four hours ago I felt Master's presence
in the room; my terrible symptoms immediately disappeared. I feel
that through his grace I am entirely well."

In a few weeks Sasi was stouter and in better health than ever
before. {FN17-1} But his singular reaction to his healing had an
ungrateful tinge: he seldom visited Sri Yukteswar again! My friend
told me one day that he so deeply regretted his previous mode of
life that he was ashamed to face Master.

I could only conclude that Sasi's illness had had the contrasting
effect of stiffening his will and impairing his manners.

The first two years of my course at Scottish Church College were
drawing to a close. My classroom attendance had been very spasmodic;
what little studying I did was only to keep peace with my family.
My two private tutors came regularly to my house; I was regularly
absent: I can discern at least this one regularity in my scholastic
career!

In India two successful years of college bring an Intermediate Arts
diploma; the student may then look forward to another two years
and his A.B. degree.

The Intermediate Arts final examinations loomed ominously ahead.
I fled to Puri, where my guru was spending a few weeks. Vaguely
hoping that he would sanction my nonappearance at the finals, I
related my embarrassing unpreparedness.

But Master smiled consolingly. "You have wholeheartedly pursued
your spiritual duties, and could not help neglecting your college
work.  Apply yourself diligently to your books for the next week:
you shall get through your ordeal without failure."

I returned to Calcutta, firmly suppressing all reasonable doubts
that occasionally arose with unnerving ridicule. Surveying the
mountain of books on my table, I felt like a traveler lost in a
wilderness. A long period of meditation brought me a labor-saving
inspiration. Opening each book at random, I studied only those
pages which lay thus exposed. Pursuing this course during eighteen
hours a day for a week, I considered myself entitled to advise all
succeeding generations on the art of cramming.

The following days in the examination halls were a justification
of my seemingly haphazard procedure. I passed all the tests, though
by a hairbreadth. The congratulations of my friends and family were
ludicrously mixed with ejaculations betraying their astonishment.

On his return from Puri, Sri Yukteswar gave me a pleasant surprise.
"Your Calcutta studies are now over. I will see that you pursue
your last two years of university work right here in Serampore."

I was puzzled. "Sir, there is no Bachelor of Arts course in this
town." Serampore College, the sole institution of higher learning,
offered only a two-year course in Intermediate Arts.

Master smiled mischievously. "I am too old to go about collecting
donations to establish an A.B. college for you. I guess I shall
have to arrange the matter through someone else."

Two months later Professor Howells, president of Serampore College,
publicly announced that he had succeeded in raising sufficient
funds to offer a four-year course. Serampore College became a branch
affiliation of the University of Calcutta. I was one of the first
students to enroll in Serampore as an A.B. candidate.

"Guruji, how kind you are to me! I have been longing to leave
Calcutta and be near you every day in Serampore. Professor Howells
does not dream how much he owes to your silent help!"

Sri Yukteswar gazed at me with mock severity. "Now you won't have
to spend so many hours on trains; what a lot of free time for your
studies! Perhaps you will become less of a last-minute crammer and
more of a scholar." But somehow his tone lacked conviction.

{FN17-1} In 1936 I heard from a friend that Sasi was still in
excellent health.



CHAPTER: 18

A MOHAMMEDAN WONDER-WORKER

"Years ago, right in this very room you now occupy, a Mohammedan
wonder-worker performed four miracles before me!"

Sri Yukteswar made this surprising statement during his first visit
to my new quarters. Immediately after entering Serampore College,
I had taken a room in a near-by boardinghouse, called PANTHI. It
was an old-fashioned brick mansion, fronting the Ganges.

"Master, what a coincidence! Are these newly decorated walls really
ancient with memories?" I looked around my simply furnished room
with awakened interest.

"It is a long story." My guru smiled reminiscently. "The name of
the FAKIR {FN18-1} was Afzal Khan. He had acquired his extraordinary
powers through a chance encounter with a Hindu yogi.

"'Son, I am thirsty; fetch me some water.' A dust-covered SANNYASI
made this request of Afzal one day during his early boyhood in a
small village of eastern Bengal.

"'Master, I am a Mohammedan. How could you, a Hindu, accept a drink
from my hands?'

"'Your truthfulness pleases me, my child. I do not observe
the ostracizing rules of ungodly sectarianism. Go; bring me water
quickly.'

"Afzal's reverent obedience was rewarded by a loving glance from
the yogi.

"'You possess good karma from former lives,' he observed solemnly.
'I am going to teach you a certain yoga method which will give you
command over one of the invisible realms. The great powers that
will be yours should be exercised for worthy ends; never employ
them selfishly! I perceive, alas! that you have brought over from
the past some seeds of destructive tendencies. Do not allow them
to sprout by watering them with fresh evil actions. The complexity
of your previous karma is such that you must use this life to
reconcile your yogic accomplishments with the highest humanitarian
goals.'

"After instructing the amazed boy in a complicated technique, the
master vanished.

"Afzal faithfully followed his yoga exercise for twenty years. His
miraculous feats began to attract widespread attention. It seems that
he was always accompanied by a disembodied spirit whom he called
'Hazrat.' This invisible entity was able to fulfill the FAKIR'S
slightest wish.

"Ignoring his master's warning, Afzal began to misuse his powers.
Whatever object he touched and then replaced would soon disappear
without a trace. This disconcerting eventuality usually made the
Mohammedan an objectionable guest!

"He visited large jewelry stores in Calcutta from time to time,
representing himself as a possible purchaser. Any jewel he handled
would vanish shortly after he had left the shop.

"Afzal was often surrounded by several hundred students, attracted
by the hope of learning his secrets. The FAKIR occasionally invited
them to travel with him. At the railway station he would manage
to touch a roll of tickets. These he would return to the clerk,
remarking: 'I have changed my mind, and won't buy them now.'
But when he boarded the train with his retinue, Afzal would be in
possession of the required tickets. {FN18-2}

"These exploits created an indignant uproar; Bengali jewelers and
ticket-sellers were succumbing to nervous breakdowns! The police
who sought to arrest Afzal found themselves helpless; the FAKIR
could remove incriminating evidence merely by saying: 'Hazrat, take
this away.'"

Sri Yukteswar rose from his seat and walked to the balcony of my
room which overlooked the Ganges. I followed him, eager to hear
more of the baffling Mohammedan Raffles.

"This PANTHI house formerly belonged to a friend of mine. He became
acquainted with Afzal and asked him here. My friend also invited
about twenty neighbors, including myself. I was only a youth then,
and felt a lively curiosity about the notorious FAKIR." Master
laughed. "I took the precaution of not wearing anything valuable!
Afzal looked me over inquisitively, then remarked:

"'You have powerful hands. Go downstairs to the garden; get a
smooth stone and write your name on it with chalk; then throw the
stone as far as possible into the Ganges.'

"I obeyed. As soon as the stone had vanished under distant waves,
the Mohammedan addressed me again:

"'Fill a pot with Ganges water near the front of this house.'

"After I had returned with a vessel of water, the FAKIR cried,
'Hazrat, put the stone in the pot!'

"The stone appeared at once. I pulled it from the vessel and found
my signature as legible as when I had written it.

"Babu, {FN18-3} one of my friends in the room, was wearing a heavy
antique gold watch and chain. The FAKIR examined them with ominous
admiration. Soon they were missing!

"'Afzal, please return my prized heirloom!' Babu was nearly in
tears.

"The Mohammedan was stoically silent for awhile, then said, 'You
have five hundred rupees in an iron safe. Bring them to me, and I
will tell you where to locate your timepiece.'

"The distraught Babu left immediately for his home. He came back
shortly and handed Afzal the required sum.

"'Go to the little bridge near your house,' the FAKIR instructed
Babu.  'Call on Hazrat to give you the watch and chain.'

"Babu rushed away. On his return, he was wearing a smile of relief
and no jewelry whatever.

"'When I commanded Hazrat as directed,' he announced, 'my watch
came tumbling down from the air into my right hand! You may be sure
I locked the heirloom in my safe before rejoining the group here!'

"Babu's friends, witnesses of the comicotragedy of the ransom for a
watch, were staring with resentment at Afzal. He now spoke placatingly.

"'Please name any drink you want; Hazrat will produce it.'

"A number asked for milk, others for fruit juices. I was not too
much shocked when the unnerved Babu requested whisky! The Mohammedan
gave an order; the obliging Hazrat sent sealed containers sailing
down the air and thudding to the floor. Each man found his desired
beverage.

"The promise of the fourth spectacular feat of the day was doubtless
gratifying to our host: Afzal offered to supply an instantaneous
lunch!

"'Let us order the most expensive dishes,' Babu suggested gloomily.
'I want an elaborate meal for my five hundred rupees! Everything
should be served on gold plates!'

"As soon as each man had expressed his preferences, the FAKIR addressed
himself to the inexhaustible Hazrat. A great rattle ensued; gold
platters filled with intricately-prepared curries, hot LUCHIS, and
many out-of-season fruits, landed from nowhere at our feet. All
the food was delicious. After feasting for an hour, we started to
leave the room. A tremendous noise, as though dishes were being
piled up, caused us to turn around. Lo! there was no sign of the
glittering plates or the remnants of the meal."

"Guruji," I interrupted, "if Afzal could easily secure such things
as gold dishes, why did he covet the property of others?"

"The FAKIR was not highly developed spiritually," Sri Yukteswar
explained. "His mastery of a certain yoga technique gave him access
to an astral plane where any desire is immediately materialized.
Through the agency of an astral being, Hazrat, the Mohammedan could
summon the atoms of any object from etheric energy by an act of
powerful will.  But such astrally-produced objects are structurally
evanescent; they cannot be long retained. Afzal still yearned for
worldly wealth which, though more hardly earned, has a more dependable
durability."

I laughed. "It too sometimes vanishes most unaccountably!"

"Afzal was not a man of God-realization," Master went on. "Miracles
of a permanent and beneficial nature are performed by true saints
because they have attuned themselves to the omnipotent Creator.
Afzal was merely an ordinary man with an extraordinary power of
penetrating a subtle realm not usually entered by mortals until
death."

"I understand now, Guruji. The after-world appears to have some
charming features."

Master agreed. "I never saw Afzal after that day, but a few years
later Babu came to my home to show me a newspaper account of the
Mohammedan's public confession. From it I learned the facts I have
just told you about Afzal's early initiation from a Hindu guru."

The gist of the latter part of the published document, as recalled
by Sri Yukteswar, was as follows: "I, Afzal Khan, am writing these
words as an act of penance and as a warning to those who seek the
possession of miraculous powers. For years I have been misusing the
wondrous abilities imparted to me through the grace of God and my
master. I became drunk with egotism, feeling that I was beyond the
ordinary laws of morality. My day of reckoning finally arrived.

"Recently I met an old man on a road outside Calcutta. He limped
along painfully, carrying a shining object which looked like gold.
I addressed him with greed in my heart.

"'I am Afzal Khan, the great FAKIR. What have you there?'

"'This ball of gold is my sole material wealth; it can be of no
interest to a FAKIR. I implore you, sir, to heal my limp.'

"I touched the ball and walked away without reply. The old man
hobbled after me. He soon raised an outcry: 'My gold is gone!'

"As I paid no attention, he suddenly spoke in a stentorian voice
that issued oddly from his frail body:

"'Do you not recognize me?'

"I stood speechless, aghast at the belated discovery that this
unimpressive old cripple was none other than the great saint who,
long, long ago, had initiated me into yoga. He straightened himself;
his body instantly became strong and youthful.

"'So!' My guru's glance was fiery. 'I see with my own eyes that
you use your powers, not to help suffering humanity, but to prey
on it like a common thief! I withdraw your occult gifts; Hazrat is
now freed from you. No longer shall you be a terror in Bengal!'

"I called on Hazrat in anguished tones; for the first time, he did
not appear to my inner sight. But some dark veil suddenly lifted
within me; I saw clearly the blasphemy of my life.

"'My guru, I thank you for coming to banish my long delusion.' I
was sobbing at his feet. 'I promise to forsake my worldly ambitions.
I will retire to the mountains for lonely meditation on God, hoping
to atone for my evil past.'

"My master regarded me with silent compassion. 'I feel your
sincerity,' he said finally. 'Because of your earlier years of
strict obedience, and because of your present repentance, I will
grant you one boon. Your other powers are now gone, but whenever
food and clothing are needed, you may still call successfully on
Hazrat to supply them. Devote yourself wholeheartedly to divine
understanding in the mountain solitudes.'

"My guru then vanished; I was left to my tears and reflections.
Farewell, world! I go to seek the forgiveness of the Cosmic Beloved."

{FN18-1} A Moslem yogi; from the Arabic FAQIR, poor; originally
applied to dervishes under a vow of poverty.

{FN18-2} My father later told me that his company, the Bengal-Nagpur
Railway, had been one of the firms victimized by Afzal Khan.

{FN18-3} I do not recall the name of Sri Yukteswar's friend, and
must refer to him simply as "Babu" (Mister).



CHAPTER: 19

MY MASTER, IN CALCUTTA, APPEARS IN SERAMPORE

"I am often beset by atheistic doubts. Yet a torturing surmise
sometimes haunts me: may not untapped soul possibilities exist? Is
man not missing his real destiny if he fails to explore them?"

These remarks of Dijen Babu, my roommate at the PANTHI boardinghouse,
were called forth by my invitation that he meet my guru.

"Sri Yukteswarji will initiate you into KRIYA YOGA," I replied.
"It calms the dualistic turmoil by a divine inner certainty."

That evening Dijen accompanied me to the hermitage. In Master's
presence my friend received such spiritual peace that he was soon
a constant visitor. The trivial preoccupations of daily life are not
enough for man; wisdom too is a native hunger. In Sri Yukteswar's
words Dijen found an incentive to those attempts-first painful,
then effortlessly liberating-to locate a realer self within his
bosom than the humiliating ego of a temporary birth, seldom ample
enough for the Spirit.

As Dijen and I were both pursuing the A.B. course at Serampore
College, we got into the habit of walking together to the ashram
as soon as classes were over. We would often see Sri Yukteswar
standing on his second-floor balcony, welcoming our approach with
a smile.

One afternoon Kanai, a young hermitage resident, met Dijen and me
at the door with disappointing news.

"Master is not here; he was summoned to Calcutta by an urgent note."

The following day I received a post card from my guru. "I shall
leave Calcutta Wednesday morning," he had written. "You and Dijen
meet the nine o'clock train at Serampore station."

About eight-thirty on Wednesday morning, a telepathic message from
