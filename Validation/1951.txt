Edited by Andrew Lang



Preface



'What cases are you engaged in at present?' 'Are you stopping many teeth
just now?' 'What people have you converted lately?' Do ladies put these
questions to the men--lawyers, dentists, clergymen, and so forth--who
happen to sit next them at dinner parties?

I do not know whether ladies thus indicate their interest in the
occupations of their casual neighbours at the hospitable board. But if
they do not know me, or do not know me well, they generally ask 'Are
you writing anything now?' (as if they should ask a painter 'Are you
painting anything now?' or a lawyer 'Have you any cases at present?').
Sometimes they are more definite and inquire 'What are you writing now?'
as if I must be writing something--which, indeed, is the case, though
I dislike being reminded of it. It is an awkward question, because the
fair being does not care a bawbee what I am writing; nor would she
be much enlightened if I replied 'Madam, I am engaged on a treatise
intended to prove that Normal is prior to Conceptional Totemism'--though
that answer would be as true in fact as obscure in significance. The
best plan seems to be to answer that I have entirely abandoned mere
literature, and am contemplating a book on 'The Causes of Early Blight
in the Potato,' a melancholy circumstance which threatens to deprive us
of our chief esculent root. The inquirer would never be undeceived.
One nymph who, like the rest, could not keep off the horrid topic of my
occupation, said 'You never write anything but fairy books, do you?' A
French gentleman, too, an educationist and expert in portraits of Queen
Mary, once sent me a newspaper article in which he had written that I
was exclusively devoted to the composition of fairy books, and nothing
else. He then came to England, visited me, and found that I knew rather
more about portraits of Queen Mary than he did.

In truth I never did write any fairy books in my life, except 'Prince
Prigio,' 'Prince Ricardo,' and 'Tales from a Fairy Court'--that of the
aforesaid Prigio. I take this opportunity of recommending these fairy
books--poor things, but my own--to parents and guardians who may never
have heard of them. They are rich in romantic adventure, and the Princes
always marry the right Princesses and live happy ever afterwards;
while the wicked witches, stepmothers, tutors and governesses are never
cruelly punished, but retire to the country on ample pensions. I hate
cruelty: I never put a wicked stepmother in a barrel and send her
tobogganing down a hill. It is true that Prince Ricardo did kill the
Yellow Dwarf; but that was in fair fight, sword in hand, and the dwarf,
peace to his ashes! died in harness.

The object of these confessions is not only that of advertising my own
fairy books (which are not 'out of print'; if your bookseller says so,
the truth is not in him), but of giving credit where credit is due.
The fairy books have been almost wholly the work of Mrs. Lang, who
has translated and adapted them from the French, German, Portuguese,
Italian, Spanish, Catalan, and other languages.

My part has been that of Adam, according to Mark Twain, in the Garden
of Eden. Eve worked, Adam superintended. I also superintend. I find out
where the stories are, and advise, and, in short, superintend. I do not
write the stories out of my own head. The reputation of having written
all the fairy books (an European reputation in nurseries and the United
States of America) is 'the burden of an honour unto which I was not
born.' It weighs upon and is killing me, as the general fash of being
the wife of the Lord of Burleigh, Burleigh House by Stamford Town, was
too much for the village maiden espoused by that peer.

Nobody really wrote most of the stories. People told them in all parts
of the world long before Egyptian hieroglyphics or Cretan signs or
Cyprian syllabaries, or alphabets were invented. They are older than
reading and writing, and arose like wild flowers before men had any
education to quarrel over. The grannies told them to the grandchildren,
and when the grandchildren became grannies they repeated the same old
tales to the new generation. Homer knew the stories and made up the
'Odyssey' out of half a dozen of them. All the history of Greece till
about 800 B.C. is a string of the fairy tales, all about Theseus and
Heracles and Oedipus and Minos and Perseus is a Cabinet des Fes, a
collection of fairy tales. Shakespeare took them and put bits of
them into 'King Lear' and other plays; he could not have made them up
himself, great as he was. Let ladies and gentlemen think of this when
they sit down to write fairy tales, and have them nicely typed, and send
them to Messrs. Longman & Co. to be published. They think that to
write a new fairy tale is easy work. They are mistaken: the thing is
impossible. Nobody can write a new fairy tale; you can only mix up and
dress up the old, old stories, and put the characters into new dresses,
as Miss Thackeray did so well in 'Five Old Friends.' If any big girl
of fourteen reads this preface, let her insist on being presented with
'Five Old Friends.'

But the three hundred and sixty-five authors who try to write new fairy
tales are very tiresome. They always begin with a little boy or girl who
goes out and meets the fairies of polyanthuses and gardenias and apple
blossoms: 'Flowers and fruits, and other winged things.' These fairies
try to be funny, and fail; or they try to preach, and succeed. Real
fairies never preach or talk slang. At the end, the little boy or girl
wakes up and finds that he has been dreaming.

Such are the new fairy stories. May we be preserved from all the sort of
them!

Our stories are almost all old, some from Ireland, before that island
was as celebrated for her wrongs as for her verdure; some from Asia,
made, I dare say, before the Aryan invasion; some from Moydart,
Knoydart, Morar and Ardnamurchan, where the sea streams run like great
clear rivers and the saw-edged hills are blue, and men remember Prince
Charlie. Some are from Portugal, where the golden fruits grow in the
Garden of the Hesperides; and some are from wild Wales, and were told at
Arthur's Court; and others come from the firesides of the kinsmen of
the Welsh, the Bretons. There are also modern tales by a learned
Scandinavian named Topelius.

All the stories were translated or adapted by Mrs. Lang, except 'The
Jogi's Punishment' and 'Moti,' done by Major Campbell out of the Pushtoo
language; 'How Brave Walter hunted Wolves,' which, with 'Little Lasse'
and 'The Raspberry Worm,' was done from Topelius by Miss Harding; and
'The Sea King's Gift,' by Miss Christie, from the same author.

It has been suggested to the Editor that children and parents and
guardians would like 'The Grey True Ghost-Story Book.' He knows that the
children would like it well, and he would gladly give it to them; but
about the taste of fond anxious mothers and kind aunts he is not quite
so certain. Before he was twelve the Editor knew true ghost stories
enough to fill a volume. They were a pure joy till bedtime, but then,
and later, were not wholly a source of unmixed pleasure. At that time
the Editor was not afraid of the dark, for he thought, 'If a ghost is
here, we can't see him.' But when older and better informed persons said
that ghosts brought their own light with them (which is too true), then
one's emotions were such as parents do not desire the young to endure.
For this reason 'The Grey True Ghost-Story Book' is never likely to be
illustrated by Mr. Ford.

The Shifty Lad



In the land of Erin there dwelt long ago a widow who had an only son.
He was a clever boy, so she saved up enough money to send him to school,
and, as soon as he was old enough, to apprentice him to any trade that
he would choose. But when the time came, he said he would not be bound
to any trade, and that he meant to be a thief.

Now his mother was very sorrowful when she heard of this, but she knew
quite well that if she tried to stop his having his own way he would
only grow more determined to get it. So all the answer she made was that
the end of thieves was hanging at the bridge of Dublin, and then she
left him alone, hoping that when he was older he might become more
sensible.

One day she was going to church to hear a sermon from a great preacher,
and she begged the Shifty Lad, as the neighbours called him from the
tricks he played, to come with her. But he only laughed and declared
that he did not like sermons, adding:

'However, I will promise you this, that the first trade you hear named
after you come out from church shall be my trade for the rest of my
life.'

These words gave a little comfort to the poor woman, and her heart was
lighter than before as she bade him farewell.

When the Shifty Lad thought that the hour had nearly come for the sermon
to be over, he hid himself in some bushes in a little path that led
straight to his mother's house, and, as she passed along, thinking of
all the good things she had heard, a voice shouted close to her ear
'Robbery! Robbery! Robbery!' The suddenness of it made her jump. The
naughty boy had managed to change his voice, so that she did not know
it for his, and he had concealed himself so well that, though she peered
about all round her, she could see no one. As soon as she had turned
the corner the Shifty Lad came out, and by running very fast through
the wood he contrived to reach home before his mother, who found him
stretched out comfortably before the fire.

'Well, have you got any news to tell me?' asked he.

'No, nothing; for I left the church at once, and did not stop to speak
to anyone.'

'Oh, then no one has mentioned a trade to you?' he said in tones of
disappointment.

'Ye--es,' she replied slowly. 'At least, as I walked down the path a
voice cried out "Robbery! Robbery! Robbery!" but that was all.'

'And quite enough too,' answered the boy. 'What did I tell you? That is
going to be my trade.'

'Then your end will be hanging at the bridge of Dublin,' said she. But
there was no sleep for her that night, for she lay in the dark thinking
about her son.

'If he is to be a thief at all, he had better be a good one. And who is
there that can teach him?' the mother asked herself. But an idea came
to her, and she arose early, before the sun was up, and set off for the
home of the Black Rogue, or Gallows Bird, who was such a wonderful thief
that, though all had been robbed by him, no one could catch him.

'Good-morning to you,' said the woman as she reached the place where the
Black Gallows Bird lived when he was not away on his business. 'My son
has a fancy to learn your trade. Will you be kind enough to teach him?'

'If he is clever, I don't mind trying,' answered the Black Gallows Bird;
'and, of course, if ANY one can turn him into a first-rate thief, it
is I. But if he is stupid, it is of no use at all; I can't bear stupid
people.'

'No, he isn't stupid,' said the woman with a sigh. 'So to-night, after
dark, I will send him to you.'

The Shifty Lad jumped for joy when his mother told him where she had
been.

'I will become the best thief in all Erin!' he cried, and paid no heed
when his mother shook her head and murmured something about 'the bridge
of Dublin.'

Every evening after dark the Shifty Lad went to the home of the Black
Gallows Bird, and many were the new tricks he learned. By-and-by he was
allowed to go out with the Bird and watch him at work, and at last there
came a day when his master though that he had grown clever enough to
help in a big robbery.

'There is a rich farmer up there on the hill, who has just sold all his
fat cattle for much money and has bought some lean ones which will cost
him little. Now it happens that, while he has received the money for the
fat cattle, he has not yet paid the price of the thin ones, which he has
in the cowhouse. To-morrow he will go to the market with the money in
his hand, so to-night we must get at the chest. When all is quiet we
will hide in the loft.'

There was no moon, and it was the night of Hallowe'en, and everyone
was burning nuts and catching apples in a tub of water with their hands
tied, and playing all sorts of other games, till the Shifty Lad grew
quite tired of waiting for them to get to bed. The Black Gallows Bird,
who was more accustomed to the business, tucked himself up on the hay
and went to sleep, telling the boy to wake him when the merry-makers had
departed. But the Shifty Lad, who could keep still no longer, crept down
to the cowshed and loosened the heads of the cattle which were tied, and
they began to kick each other and bellow, and made such a noise that the
company in the farmhouse ran out to tie them up again. Then the Shifty
Lad entered the room and picked up a big handful of nuts, and returned
to the loft, where the Black Rogue was still sleeping. At first the
Shifty Lad shut his eyes too, but very soon he sat up, and taking a big
needle and thread from his pocket, he sewed the hem of the Black Gallows
Bird's coat to a heavy piece of bullock's hide that was hanging at his
back.

By this time the cattle were all tied up again, but as the people could
not find their nuts they sat round the fire and began to tell stories.

'I will crack a nut,' said the Shifty Lad.

'You shall not,' cried the Black Gallows Bird; 'they will hear you.'

'I don't care,' answered the Shifty Lad. 'I never spend Hallowe'en yet
without cracking a nut'; and he cracked one.

'Some one is cracking nuts up there,' said one of the merry-makers in
the farmhouse. 'Come quickly, and we will see who it is.'

He spoke loudly, and the Black Gallows Bird heard, and ran out of the
loft, dragging the big leather hide after him which the Shifty Lad had
sewed to his coat.

'He is stealing my hide!' shouted the farmer, and they all darted after
him; but he was too swift for them, and at last he managed to tear the
hide from his coat, and then he flew like a hare till he reached his old
hiding-place. But all this took a long time, and meanwhile the Shifty
Lad got down from the loft, and searched the house till he found the
chest with the gold and silver in it, concealed behind a load of straw
and covered with loaves of bread and a great cheese. The Shifty Lad
slung the money bags round his shoulders and took the bread and the
cheese under his arm, then set out quietly for the Black Rogue's house.

'Here you are at last, you villain!' cried his master in great wrath.
'But I will be revenged on you.'

'It is all right,' replied the Shifty Lad calmly. 'I have brought what
you wanted'; and he laid the things he was carrying down on the ground.

'Ah! you are the better thief,' said the Black Rogue's wife; and the
Black Rogue added:

'Yes, it is you who are the clever boy'; and they divided the spoil and
the Black Gallows Bird had one half and the Shifty Lad the other half.

A few weeks after that the Black Gallows Bird had news of a wedding that
was to be held near the town; and the bridegroom had many friends and
everybody sent him a present. Now a rich farmer who lived up near the
moor thought that nothing was so useful to a young couple when they
first began to keep house as a fine fat sheep, so he bade his shepherd
go off to the mountain where the flock were feeding, and bring him
back the best he could find. And the shepherd chose out the largest and
fattest of the sheep and the one with the whitest fleece; then he tied
