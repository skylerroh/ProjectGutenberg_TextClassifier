FIFTY FAMOUS PEOPLE

A BOOK OF SHORT STORIES

BY JAMES BALDWIN





PREFATORY NOTE



One of the best things to be said of the stories in this volume is
that, although they are not biographical, they are about real persons
who actually lived and performed their parts in the great drama of the
world's history. Some of these persons were more famous than others,
yet all have left enduring "footprints on the sands of time" and their
names will not cease to be remembered. In each of the stories there
is a basis of truth and an ethical lesson which cannot fail to have
a wholesome influence; and each possesses elements of interest which,
it is believed, will go far towards proving the fallibility of the
doctrine that children find delight only in tales of the imaginative
and unreal. The fact that there are a few more than fifty famous people
mentioned in the volume may be credited to the author's wish to give
good measure.

SAVING THE BIRDS



One day in spring four men were riding on horseback along a country
road. These men were lawyers, and they were going to the next town to
attend court.

There had been a rain, and the ground was very soft. Water was dripping
from the trees, and the grass was wet.

The four lawyers rode along, one behind another; for the pathway was
narrow, and the mud on each side of it was deep. They rode slowly, and
talked and laughed and were very jolly.

As they were passing through a grove of small trees, they heard a great
fluttering over their heads and a feeble chirping in the grass by the
roadside.

"Stith! stith! stith!" came from the leafy branches above them.

"Cheep! cheep! cheep!" came from the wet grass.

"What is the matter here?" asked the first lawyer, whose name was
Speed. "Oh, it's only some old robins!" said the second lawyer, whose
name was Hardin. "The storm has blown two of the little ones out of
the nest. They are too young to fly, and the mother bird is making a
great fuss about it."

"What a pity! They'll die down there in the grass," said the third
lawyer, whose name I forget.

"Oh, well! They're nothing but birds," said Mr. Hardin. "Why should
we bother?"

"Yes, why should we?" said Mr. Speed.

The three men, as they passed, looked down and saw the little birds
fluttering in the cold, wet grass. They saw the mother robin flying
about, and crying to her mate.

Then they rode on, talking and laughing as before. In a few minutes
they had forgotten about the birds.

But the fourth lawyer, whose name was Abraham Lincoln, stopped. He got
down from his horse and very gently took the little ones up in his big
warm hands.

They did not seem frightened, but chirped softly, as if they knew they
were safe.

"Never mind, my little fellows," said Mr. Lincoln "I will put you in
your own cozy little bed."

[Illustration]

Then he looked up to find the nest from which they had fallen. It was
high, much higher than he could reach.

But Mr. Lincoln could climb. He had climbed many a tree when he was
a boy. He put the birds softly, one by one, into their warm little
home. Two other baby birds were there, that had not fallen out. All
cuddled down together and were very happy.

Soon the three lawyers who had ridden ahead stopped at a spring to
give their horses water.

"Where is Lincoln?" asked one.

All were surprised to find that he was not with them.

"Do you remember those birds?" said Mr. Speed. "Very likely he has
stopped to take care of them."

In a few minutes Mr. Lincoln joined them. His shoes were covered with
mud; he had torn his coat on the thorny tree.

"Hello, Abraham!" said Mr. Hardin. "Where have you been?"

"I stopped a minute to give those birds to their mother," he answered.

"Well, we always thought you were a hero," said Mr. Speed. "Now we
know it."

Then all three of them laughed heartily. They thought it so foolish
that a strong man should take so much trouble just for some worthless
young birds.

"Gentlemen," said Mr. Lincoln, "I could not have slept to-night, if
I had left those helpless little robins to perish in the wet grass."

Abraham Lincoln afterwards became very famous as a lawyer and
statesman. He was elected president. Next to Washington he was the
greatest American.



ANOTHER BIRD STORY



A great battle had begun. Cannon were booming, some far away, some
near at hand. Soldiers were marching through the fields. Men on
horseback were riding in haste toward the front.

"Whiz!" A cannon ball struck the ground quite near to a company of
soldiers. But they marched straight onward. The drums were beating,
the fifes were playing.

"Whiz!" Another cannon ball flew through the air and struck a tree
near by. A brave general was riding across the field. One ball after
another came whizzing near him.

"General, you are in danger here," said an officer who was riding with
him. "You had better fall back to a place of safety."

[Illustration]

But the general rode on.

Suddenly he stopped at the foot of a tree. "Halt!" he cried to the men
who were with him. He leaped from his horse. He stooped and picked up
a bird's nest that had fallen upon the ground. In the nest were some
tiny, half-fledged birds. Their mouths were open for the food they
were expecting their mother to give them.

"I cannot think of leaving these little things here to be trampled
upon," said the general.

He lifted the nest gently and put it in a safe place in the forks of
the tree.

"Whiz!" Another cannon ball.

He leaped into the saddle, and away he dashed with his officers close
behind him.

"Whiz! whiz! whiz!"

He had done one good deed. He would do many more before the war was
over. "Boom! boom! boom!"

The cannon were roaring, the balls were flying, the battle was raging.
But amid all the turmoil and danger, the little birds chirped happily
in the safe shelter where the great general, Robert E. Lee, had placed
them. "He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and
small; For the dear God who loveth us, He made and loveth all."




SPEAKING A PIECE



Two children, brother and sister, were on their way to school. Both
were very small. The boy was only four years old, and the girl was
not yet six. "Come, Edward, we must hurry," said the sister. "We must
not be late." With one hand the little boy clung to his sister's arm,
and with the other he held his primer.

This primer was his only book, and he loved it. It had a bright blue
cover, which he was careful not to soil. And in it were some odd little
pictures, which he never grew tired of looking at.

Edward could spell nearly all the words in his primer, and he could
read quite well.

The school was more than a mile from their home, and the children
trotted along as fast as their short legs could carry them.

At a place where two roads crossed, they saw a tall gentleman coming
to meet them. He was dressed in black, and had a very pleasant face.

"Oh, Edward, there is Mr. Harris!" whispered the little girl. "Don't
forget your manners."

They were glad to see Mr. Harris, for he was the minister. They stopped
by the side of the road and made their manners. Edward bowed very
gracefully, and his sister curtsied.

"Good morning, children!" said the minister; and he kindly shook hands
with both.

[Illustration]

"I have something here for little Edward," he said. Then he took from
his pocket a sheet of paper on which some verses were written.

"See! It is a little speech that I have written for him. The teacher
will soon ask him to speak a piece at school, and I am sure that he
can learn this easily and speak it well"

Edward took the paper and thanked the kind minister.

"Mother will help him learn it," said his sister.

"Yes, I will try to learn it," said Edward.

"Do so, my child," said the Minister; "and I hope that when you grow
up you will become a wise man and a great orator."

Then the two children hurried on to school.

The speech was not hard to learn, and Edward soon knew every word of
it. When the time came for him to speak, his mother and the minister
were both there to hear him.

He spoke so well that everybody was pleased. He pronounced every word
plainly, as though he were talking to his schoolmates.

Would you like to read his speech? Here it is:--

      Pray, how shall I, a little lad,
      In speaking make a figure?
      You're only joking, I'm afraid--
      Just wait till I am bigger.

      But since you wish to hear my part,
      And urge me to begin it,
      I'll strive for praise with all my heart,
      Though small the hope to win it.


      I'll tell a tale how Farmer John
      A little roan colt bred, sir,
      Which every night and every morn
      He watered and he fed, sir.

      Said Neighbor Joe to Farmer John,
      "You surely are a dolt, sir,
      To spend such time and care upon
      A little useless colt, sir."

      Said Farmer John to Neighbor Joe,
      "I bring my little roan up
      Not for the good he now can do,
      But will do when he's grown up."

      The moral you can plainly see,
      To keep the tale from spoiling,
      The little colt you think is me--
      I know it by your smiling.

      And now, my friends, please to excuse
      My lisping and my stammers;
      I, for this once, have done my best,
      And so--I'll make my manners.

The little boy's name was Edward Everett. He grew up to become a famous
man and one of our greatest orators.




WRITING A COMPOSITION



"Children, to-morrow I shall expect all of you to write compositions,"
said the teacher of Love Lane School. "Then, on Friday those who have
done the best may stand up and read their compositions to the school."

Some of the children were pleased, and some were not.

"What shall we write about?" they asked.

"You may choose any subject that you like best," said the teacher.

Some of them thought that "Home" was a good subject. Others liked
"School." One little boy chose "The Horse." A little girl said she
would write about "Summer."

The next day, every pupil except one had written a composition.

"Henry Longfellow," said the teacher, "why have you not written?"

"Because I don't know how," answered Henry. He was only a child.

"Well," said the teacher, "you can write words, can you not?"

"Yes, sir," said the boy.

"After you have written three or four words, you can put them together,
can you not?"

"Yes, sir; I think so."

"Well, then," said the teacher, "you may take your slate and go out
behind the schoolhouse for half an hour. Think of something to write
about, and write the word on your slate. Then try to tell what it is,
what it is like, what it is good for, and what is done with it. That
is the way to write a composition."

Henry took his slate and went out. Just behind the schoolhouse was Mr.
Finney's barn. Quite close to the barn was a garden. And in the garden,
Henry saw a turnip.

"Well, I know what that is," he said to himself; and he wrote the word
_turnip_ on his slate. Then he tried to tell what it was like, what it
was good for, and what was done with it.

Before the half hour was ended he had written a very neat composition
on his slate. He then went into the house, and waited while the teacher
read it.

The teacher was surprised and pleased. He said, "Henry Longfellow, you
have done very well. Today you may stand up before the school and read
what you have written about the turnip."

Many years after that, some funny little verses about Mr. Finney's
turnip were printed in a newspaper. Some people said that they were
what Henry Longfellow wrote on his slate that day at school.

But this was not true. Henry's composition was not in verse. As soon
as it was read to the school, he rubbed it off the slate, and it was
forgotten. Perhaps you would like to read those funny verses. Here
they are; but you must never, _never_, NEVER think that Henry
Longfellow wrote them.

      Mr. Finney had a turnip,
      And it grew, and it grew;
