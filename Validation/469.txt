In sending for estimates, be careful to send us the copy we are to
work from, with full specifications as to size and quality, and
remember that it is the same with engraving that it is with everything
else; the price will vary greatly with the quality of work ordered.

Never, directly or indirectly, ask us to give _you_ better prices than
we give our other customers, as we try to treat all alike.

The great advantage of our method of engraving enables us to give
better work at lower prices than can be given by any other method for
the greater part of such work as would be given to wood-engravers,
though in very small pieces of the poorer grades of work the advantage
is not so great, and in very coarse work such as is usually engraved
on mahogany and pine, our process gives us no advantage over the
wood-engraver.

To estimate properly upon any piece of work, we must understand just
what is wanted. We guarantee all our work to be executed in the style
agreed upon.

WROUGHT IRON BEAMS & GIRDERS

[Illustration: WROUGHT IRON BEAMS & GIRDERS]

THE UNION IRON MILLS, Pittsburgh, Pa., Manufacturers of improved
wrought iron Beams and Girders (patented).

The great fall which has taken place in the prices of Iron, and
especially in Beams used in the construction of FIRE PROOF BUILDINGS,
induces us to call the special attention of Engineers, Architects, and
Builders to the undoubted advantages of now erecting Fire Proof
structures; and by reference to pages 52 & 54 of our Book of Sections--
which will be sent on application to those contemplating the erection
of fire proof buildings--THE COST CAN BE ACCURATELY CALCULATED, the
cost of Insurance avoided, and the serious losses and interruption to
business caused by fire; these and like considerations fully justify
any additional first cost. It is believed, that were owners fully
aware of the small difference which now exists between the use of Wood
and Iron, that in many cases the latter would be adopted.

We shall be pleased to furnish estimates for all the Beams complete,
for any specific structure, so that the difference in cost may at once
be ascertained. Address
