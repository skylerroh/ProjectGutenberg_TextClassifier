and keen, and he felt that this part of the conference would be an
awkward and embarrassing one. He had tried to nerve himself for
the interview, and thought he had succeeded, but when the servant
brought Mr. Armstrong's card he felt a sinking at his heart, and
it was in a tone that betrayed nervousness that he said: "Bring
the gentleman in."

"My dear sir," he said, extending his hand and vigorously shaking
the hand of his new arrival, "this is an unexpected pleasure."

"Unexpected? Didn't you get my letter from London?" said Mr.
Armstrong, suffering his hand to be shaken, but not returning
the arm pressure.

"Certainly--"

"In which I mentioned my approaching departure?"

"Yes, certainly; but I didn't know on what day to expect you.
Pray sit down. It seems pleasant to see you home safe and well."

"Humph!" returned Armstrong, in a tone by no means as cordial.
"Have you found my box of bonds?"

"Not yet, but--"

"Permit me to ask you why you allowed me to remain ignorant of so
important a matter? I was indebted to the public prints, to which
my attention was directed by an acquaintance, for a piece of news
which should have been communicated to me at once."

"My dear sir, I intended to write you as soon as I heard of your
arrival. I did not know till this moment that you were in America."

"You might have inferred it from the intimation in my last letter.
Why did you not cable me the news?"

"Because," replied Duncan awkwardly, "I did not wish to spoil your
pleasure, and thought from day to day that the box would turn up."

"You were very sparing of my feelings," said Armstrong, dryly--
"too much so. I am not a child or an old woman, and it was your
imperative duty, in a matter so nearly affecting my interests,
to apprise me at once."

"I may have erred in judgment," said Duncan meekly, "but I beg
you to believe that I acted as I supposed for the best."

"Leaving that out of consideration at present, let me know what
steps you have taken to find out how the box was spirited away,
or who was concerned in the robbery."

"I think that you will admit that I acted promptly," said the bank
president complacently, "when I say that within twenty-four hours I
arrested a party on suspicion of being implicated in the robbery,
and tried him myself."

"Who was the party?" asked the capitalist, not betraying the
knowledge he had already assessed on the subject.

"A boy in the village named Luke Larkin."

"Humph! What led you to think a boy had broken into the bank?
That does not strike me as very sharp on your part."

"I had positive evidence that the boy in question had a tin box
concealed in his house--in his mother's trunk. His poverty made
it impossible that the box could be his, and I accordingly had
him arrested."

"Well, what was the result of the trial?"

"I was obliged to let him go, though by no means satisfied of
his innocence."

"Why?"

"A man--a stranger--a very suspicious-looking person, presented
himself, and swore that the box was his, and that he had committed
it to the charge of this boy."

"Well, that seems tolerably satisfactory, doesn't it?--that is,
if he furnished evidence confirming his statement. Did he open the
box in court?"

"Yes."

"And the bonds were not there?"

"The bonds were not there only some papers, and what appeared to be
certificates of stock."

"Yet you say you are still suspicious of this man and boy."

"Yes."

"Explain your grounds."

"I thought," replied the president, rather meekly, "he might have
taken the bonds from the box and put in other papers."

"That was not very probable. Moreover, he would hardly be likely
to leave the box in the village in the charge of a boy."

"The boy might have been his confederate."

"What is the boy's reputation in the village? Has he ever been
detected in any act of dishonesty?"

"Not that I know of, but there is one suspicious circumstance to
which I would like to call your attention."

"Well?"

"Since this happened Luke has come out in new clothes, and wears
a silver watch. The family is very poor, and he could not have
had money to buy them unless he obtained some outside aid."

"What, then, do you infer?"

"That he has been handsomely paid for his complicity in the
robbery."

"What explanation does he personally give of this unusual
expenditure?"

"He admits that they were paid for by this suspicious stranger."

"Has the stranger--what is his name, by the way?"

"Roland Reed, he calls himself, but this, probably, is not his
real name."

"Well, has this Reed made his appearance in the village since?"

"If so, he has come during the night, and has not been seen
by any of us."

"I can't say I share your suspicion against Mr. Reed. Your theory
that he took out the bonds and substituted other papers is
far-fetched and improbable. As to the boy, I consider him honest
and reliable."

"Do you know Luke Larkin?" asked Mr. Duncan quickly.

"Last summer I observed him somewhat, and never saw anything
wrong in him."

"Appearances are deceitful," said the bank president sententiously.

"So I have heard," returned Mr. Armstrong dryly. "But let us go on.
What other steps have you taken to discover the lost box?"

"I have had the bank vaults thoroughly searched," answered Duncan,
trying to make the best of a weak situation.

"Of course. It is hardly to be supposed that it has been mislaid.
Even if it had been it would have turned up before this. Did you
discover any traces of the bank being forcibly entered?"

"No; but the burglar may have covered his tracks."

"There would have been something to show an entrance. What is the
character of the cashier and teller."

"I know nothing to their disadvantage."

"Then neither have fallen under suspicion?"

"Not as yet," answered the president pointedly.

"It is evident," thought John Armstrong, "that Mr. Duncan is
interested in diverting suspicion from some quarter. He is willing
that these men should incur suspicion, though it is clear he has
none in his own mind."

"Well, what else have you done? Have you employed detectives?" asked
Armstrong, impatiently.

"I was about to do so," answered Mr. Duncan, in some embarrassment,
"when I heard that you were coming home, and I thought I would defer
that matter for your consideration."

"Giving time in the meanwhile for the thief or thieves to dispose of
their booty? This is very strange conduct, Mr. Duncan."

"I acted for the best," said Prince Duncan.

"You have singular ideas of what is best, then," observed Mr.
Armstrong coldly. "It may be too late to remedy your singular
neglect, but I will now take the matter out of your hands, and
see what I can do."

"Will you employ detectives?" asked Duncan, with evident uneasiness.

Armstrong eyed him sharply, and with growing suspicion.

"I can't say what I will do."

"Have you the numbers of the missing bonds?" asked Duncan anxiously.

"I am not sure. I am afraid I have not."

Was it imagination, or did the bank president look relieved at
this statement? John Armstrong made a mental note of this.

After eliciting the particulars of the disappearance of the bonds,
John Armstrong rose to go. He intended to return to the city, but
he made up his mind to see Luke first. He wanted to inquire the
address of Roland Reed.



CHAPTER XXII

LUKE SECURES A NEW FRIEND


Luke was engaged in copying when Mr. Armstrong called. Though he
felt surprised to see his visitor, Luke did not exhibit it in
his manner, but welcomed him politely, and invited him into the
sitting-room.

"I have called to inquire the address of your friend, Mr. Roland
Reed," said Mr. Armstrong. Then, seeing a little uneasiness in
Luke's face, he added quickly: "Don't think I have the slightest
suspicion of him as regards the loss of the bonds. I wish only
to consult him, being myself at a loss what steps to take. He
may be able to help me."

Of course, Luke cheerfully complied with his request.

"Has anything been heard yet at the bank?" he asked.

"Nothing whatever. In fact, it does not appear to me that
any very serious efforts have been made to trace the robber
or robbers. I am left to undertake the task myself."

"If there is anything I can do to help you, Mr. Armstrong,
I shall be very glad to do so," said Luke.

"I will bear that in mind, and may call upon you. As yet, my
plans are not arranged. Perhaps Mr. Reed, whom I take to be an
experienced man of the world, may be able to offer a suggestion.
You seem to be at work," he added, with a look at the table at
which Luke had been sitting.

"Yes, sir, I am making out some bills for Mr. Reed."

"Is the work likely to occupy you long?"

"No, sir; I shall probably finish the work this week."

"And then your time will be at your disposal?"

"Yes, sir."

"Pardon me the question, but I take it your means are limited?"

"Yes, sir; till recently they have been very limited--now, thanks
to Mr. Reed, who pays a liberal salary for his little girl's board,
we are very comfortable, and can get along very well, even if I do
not immediately find work."

"I am glad to hear that. If I should hear of any employment
likely to please you I will send you word."

"Thank you, sir."

"Would you object to leave home?"

"No, sir; there is little or no prospect in Groveton, and though
my mother would miss me, she now has company, and I should feel
easier about leaving her."

"If you can spare the time, won't you walk with me to the depot?"

"With great pleasure, sir," and Luke went into the adjoining
room to fetch his hat, at the same time apprising his mother that
he was going out.

On the way to the depot Mr. Armstrong managed to draw out Luke with
a view to getting better acquainted with him, and forming an idea
of his traits of character. Luke was quite aware of this, but talked
frankly and easily, having nothing to conceal.

"A thoroughly good boy, and a smart boy, too!" said Armstrong to
himself. "I must see if I can't give him a chance to rise. He seems
absolutely reliable."

On the way to the depot they met Randolph Duncan, who eyed them
curiously. He recognized Mr. Armstrong as the owner of the stolen
bonds--and was a good deal surprised to see him in such friendly
conversation with Luke. Knowing Mr. Armstrong to be a rich man,
he determined to claim acquaintance.

"How do you do, Mr. Armstrong?" he said, advancing with an
ingratiating smile.

"This is Randolph Duncan," said Luke--whom, by the way, Randolph
had not thought it necessary to notice.

"I believe I have met the young gentleman before," said Mr.
Armstrong politely, but not cordially.

"Yes, sir, I have seen you at our house," continued Randolph--"my
father is president of the Groveton Bank. He will be very glad to
see you. Won't you come home with me?"

"I have already called upon your father," said Mr. Armstrong.

"I am very sorry your bonds were stolen, Mr. Armstrong."

"Not more than I am, I assure you," returned Mr. Armstrong,
with a quizzical smile.

"Could I speak with you a moment in private, sir?" asked
Randolph, with a significant glance at Luke.

"Certainly; Luke, will you cross the road a minute? Now, young man!"

"Probably you don't know that the boy you are walking with was
suspected of taking the box from the bank."

"I have heard so; but he was acquitted of the charge, wasn't he?"

"My father still believes that he had something to do with it, and
so do I," added Randolph, with an emphatic nod of his head.

"Isn't he a friend of yours?" asked Mr. Armstrong quietly.

"No, indeed; we go to the same school, though father thinks
of sending me to an academy out of town soon, but there is no
friendship between us. He is only a working boy."

"Humph! That is very much against him," observed Mr. Armstrong,
but it was hard to tell from his tone whether he spoke in earnest
or ironically.

"Oh, well, he has to work, for the family is very poor. He's come
out in new clothes and a silver watch since the robbery. He says
the strange man from whom he received a tin box just like yours
gave them to him."

"And you think he didn't get them in that way?"

"Yes, I think they were leagued together. I feel sure that man
robbed the bank."

"Dear me, it does look suspicious!" remarked Armstrong.

"If Luke was guiding you to the train, I will take his place, sir."

"Thank you, but perhaps I had better keep him with me, and
cross-examine him a little. I suppose I can depend upon your
keeping your eyes upon him, and letting me know of any suspicious
conduct on his part?"

"Yes, sir, I will do it with pleasure," Randolph announced promptly.
He felt sure that he had excited Mr. Armstrong's suspicions, and
defeated any plans Luke might have cherished of getting in with
the capitalist.

"Have you anything more to communicate?" asked Mr. Armstrong,
politely.

"No, sir; I thought it best to put you on your guard."

"I quite appreciate your motives, Master Randolph. I shall keep
my eyes open henceforth, and hope in time to discover the real
perpetrator of the robbery. Now, Luke."

"I have dished you, young fellow!" thought Randolph, with a
triumphant glance at the unconscious Luke. He walked away
in high self-satisfaction.

"Luke," said Mr. Armstrong, as they resumed their walk, "Randolph
seems a very warm friend of yours."

"I never thought so," said Luke, with an answering smile. "I am
glad if he has changed."

"What arrangements do you think I have made with him?"

"I don't know, sir."

"I have asked him to keep his eye on you, and, if he sees anything
suspicious, to let me know."

Luke would have been disturbed by this remark, had not the smile
on Mr. Armstrong's face belied his words.

"Does he think you are in earnest, sir?"

"Oh, yes, he has no doubt of it. He warned me of your character,
and said he was quite sure that you and your friend Mr. Reed were
implicated in the bank robbery. I told him I would cross-examine
you, and see what I could find out. Randolph told me that you were
only a working boy, which I pronounced to be very much against you."

Luke laughed outright.

"I think you are fond of a practical joke, Mr. Armstrong," he said.
"You have fooled Randolph very neatly."

"I had an object in it," said Mr. Armstrong quietly. "I may have
occasion to employ you in the matter, and if so, it will be
well that no arrangement is suspected between us. Randolph will
undoubtedly inform his father of what happened this morning."

"As I said before, sir, I am ready to do anything that lies in
my power."

Luke could not help feeling curious as to the character of the
service he would be called upon to perform. He found it difficult
to hazard a conjecture, but one thing at least seemed clear, and
this was that Mr. Armstrong was disposed to be his friend, and as
he was a rich man his friendship was likely to amount to some thing.

They had now reached the depot, and in ten minutes the train
was due.

"Don't wait if you wish to get to work, Luke," said Mr.
Armstrong kindly.
