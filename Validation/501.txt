virtuous, self-denying, wise, learned women in the world; and, dinning
this opinion perpetually into the ears of all round about her, succeeded
in bringing not few persons to join in her persuasion.

At Sir Miles's dinner there was so fine a sideboard of plate, and such
a number of men in livery, that it required some presenter: of mind
to perceive that the beer was of the smallest which the butler brought
round in the splendid tankard, and that there was but one joint of
mutton on the grand silver dish. When Sir Miles called the King's
health, and smacked his jolly lips over his wine, he eyed it and the
company as if the liquor was ambrosia. He asked Harry Warrington whether
they had port like that in Virginia? He said that was nothing to the
wine Harry should taste in Norfolk. He praised the wine so, that Harry
almost believed that it was good, and winked into his own glass, trying
to see some of the merits which his uncle perceived in the ruby nectar.

Just as we see in many a well-regulated family of this present century,
the Warringtons had their two paragons. Of the two grown daughters, the
one was the greatest beauty, the other the greatest genius and angel of
any young lady then alive, as Lady Warrington told Harry. The eldest,
the Beauty, was engaged to dear Tom Claypool, the fond mother informed
her cousin Harry in confidence. But the second daughter, the Genius and
Angel, was for ever set upon our young friend to improve his wits and
morals. She sang to him at the harpsichord--rather out of tune for
an angel, Harry thought; she was ready with advice, instruction,
conversation--with almost too much instruction and advice, thought
Harry, who would have far preferred the society of the little cousin
who reminded him of Fanny Mountain at home. But the last-mentioned young
maiden after dinner retired to her nursery commonly. Beauty went off
on her own avocations; mamma had to attend to her poor or write her
voluminous letters; papa dozed in his arm-chair; and the Genius remained
to keep her young cousin company.

The calm of the house somehow pleased the young man, and he liked
to take refuge there away from the riot and dissipation in which he
ordinarily lived. Certainly no welcome could be kinder than that which
he got. The doors were opened to him at all hours. If Flora was not at
home, Dora was ready to receive him. Ere many days' acquaintance, he and
his little cousin Miles had been to have a galloping-match in the Park,
and Harry, who was kind and generous to every man alive who came near
him, had in view the purchase of a little horse for his cousin, far
better than that which the boy rode, when the circumstances occurred
which brought all our poor Harry's coaches and horses to a sudden
breakdown.

Though Sir Miles Warrington had imagined Virginia to be an island, the
ladies were much better instructed in geography, and anxious to hear
from Harry all about his home and his native country. He, on his part,
was not averse to talk about it. He described to them the length and
breadth of his estate; the rivers which it coasted; the produce which
it bore. He had had with a friend a little practice of surveying in
his boyhood. He made a map of his county, with some fine towns here and
there, which, in truth, were but log-huts (but, for the honour of his
country, he was desirous that they should wear as handsome a look as
possible). Here was Potomac; here was James river; here were the wharves
whence his mother's ships and tobacco were brought to the sea. In truth,
the estate was as large as a county. He did not brag about the place
overmuch. To see the handsome young fellow, in a fine suit of velvet and
silver lace, making his draught, pointing out this hill and that forest
or town, you might have imagined him a travelling prince describing the
realms of the queen his mother. He almost fancied himself to be so at
times. He had miles where gentlemen in England had acres. Not only Dora
listened but the beauteous Flora bowed her fair head and heard him with
attention. Why, what was young Tom Claypool, their brother baronet's son
in Norfolk with his great boots, his great voice, and his heirdom to
a poor five thousand acres, compared to this young American prince and
charming stranger? Angel as she was, Dora began to lose her angelic
temper, and to twit Flora for a flirt. Claypool in his red waistcoat,
would sit dumb before the splendid Harry in his ruffles and laces,
talking of March and Chesterfield, Selwyn and Bolingbroke, and the whole
company of macaronis. Mamma began to love Harry more and more as a son.
She was anxious about the spiritual welfare of those poor Indians, of
those poor negroes in Virginia. What could she do to help dear Madam
Esmond (a precious woman, she knew!) in the good work? She had a serious
butler and housekeeper: they were delighted with the spiritual behaviour
and sweet musical gifts of Gumbo.

"Ah! Harry, Harry! you have been a sad wild boy! Why did you not come
sooner to us, sir, and not lose your time amongst the spendthrifts and
the vain world? But 'tis not yet too late. We must reclaim thee, dear
Harry! Mustn't we, Sir Miles? Mustn't we Dora? Mustn't we, Flora?"

The three ladies all look up to the ceiling. They will reclaim the dear
prodigal. It is which shall reclaim him most. Dora sits by and watches
Flora. As for mamma when the girls are away, she talks to him more and
more seriously, more and more tenderly. She will be a mother to him in
the absence of his own admirable parent. She gives him a hymn-book.
She kisses him on the forehead. She is actuated by the purest love,
tenderness, religious regard, towards her dear, wayward, wild, amiable
nephew.

Whilst these sentimentalities were going on, it is to be presumed that
Mr. Warrington kept his own counsel about his affairs out-of-doors,
which we have seen were in the very worst condition. He who had been
favoured by fortune for so many weeks was suddenly deserted by her, and
a few days had served to kick down all his heap of winnings. Do we say
that my Lord Castlewood, his own kinsman, had dealt unfairly by the
young Virginian, and in the course of a couple of afternoons' closet
practice had robbed him? We would insinuate nothing so disrespectful to
his lordship's character; but he had won from Harry every shilling which
properly belonged to him, and would have played him for his reversions,
but that the young man flung up his hands when he saw himself so
far beaten, and declared that he must continue the battle no more.
Remembering that there still remained a spar out of the wreck, as
it were--that portion which he had set aside for poor Sampson--Harry
ventured it at the gaming-table; but that last resource went down along
with the rest of Harry's possessions, and Fortune fluttered off in the
storm, leaving the luckless adventurer almost naked on the shore.

When a man is young and generous and hearty the loss of money scarce
afflicts him. Harry would sell his horses and carriages, and diminish
his train of life. If he wanted immediate supplies of money, would not
his Aunt Bernstein be his banker, or his kinsman who had won so much
from him, or his kind Uncle Warrington and Lady Warrington who were
always talking virtue and benevolence, and declaring that they loved
him as a son? He would call upon these, or any one of them whom he might
choose to favour, at his leisure; meanwhile, Sampson's story of his
landlord's distress touched the young gentleman, and, in order to raise
a hasty supply for the clergyman, he carried off all his trinkets to a
certain pawnbroker's shop in St. Martin's Lane.

Now this broker was a relative or partner of that very Mr. Sparks
of Tavistock Street, from whom Harry had purchased--purchased did we
say?--no; taken the trinkets which he had intended to present to his
Oakhurst friends; and it chanced that Mr. Sparks came to visit his
brother-tradesman very soon after Mr. Warrington had disposed of his
goods. Recognising immediately the little enamelled diamond-handled
repeater which he had sold to the Fortunate Youth, the jeweller broke
out into expressions regarding Harry which I will not mention here,
being already accused of speaking much too plainly. A gentleman who
is acquainted with a pawnbroker, we may be sure has a bailiff or two
amongst his acquaintances; and those bailiffs have followers who, at the
bidding of the impartial Law, will touch with equal hand the fiercest
captain's epaulet or the finest macaroni's shoulder. The very gentlemen
who had seized upon Lady Maria at Tunbridge were set upon her cousin in
London. They easily learned from the garrulous Gumbo that his honour was
at Sir Miles Warrington's house in Hill Street, and whilst the black was
courting Mrs. Lambert's maid at the adjoining mansion, Mr. Costigan and
his assistant lay in wait for poor Harry, who was enjoying the delights
of intercourse with a virtuous family circle assembled round his
aunt's table. Never had Uncle Miles been more cordial, never had Aunt
Warrington been more gracious, gentle, and affectionate; Flora looked
unusually lovely, Dora had been more than ordinarily amiable. At
parting, my lady gave him both her hands, and called benedictions from
the ceiling down upon him. Papa had said in his most jovial manner,
"Hang it, nephew! when I was thy age I should have kissed two such fine
girls as Do and Flo ere this, and my own flesh and blood too! Don't tell
me! I should, my Lady Warrington! Odds-fish! 'tis the boy blushes, and
not the girls! I think--I suppose they are used to it. He, he!"

"Papa!" cry the virgins.

"Sir Miles!" says the august mother at the same instant.

"There, there!" says papa. "A kiss won't do no harm, and won't tell no
tales: will it, nephew Harry?" I suppose, during the utterance of the
above three brief phrases, the harmless little osculatory operation has
taken place, and blushing cousin Harry has touched the damask cheek of
cousin Flora and cousin Dora.

As he goes downstairs with his uncle, mamma makes a speech to the
girls, looking, as usual, up to the ceiling, and saying, "What precious
qualities your poor dear cousin has! What shrewdness mingled with his
simplicity, and what a fine genteel manner, though upon mere worldly
elegance I set little store. What a dreadful pity to think that such a
vessel should ever be lost! We must rescue him, my loves. We must
take him away from those wicked companions, and those horrible
Castlewoods--not that I would speak ill of my neighbours. But I shall
hope, I shall pray, that he may be rescued from his evil courses!" And
again Lady Warrington eyes the cornice in a most determined manner, as
the girls wistfully look towards the door behind which their interesting
cousin has just vanished.

His uncle will go downstairs with him. He calls "God bless you, my boy!"
most affectionately: he presses Harry's hand, and repeats his valuable
benediction at the door. As it closes, the light from the hall within
having sufficiently illuminated Mr. Warrington's face and figure, two
gentlemen, who have been standing on the opposite side of the way,
advance rapidly, and one of them takes a strip of paper out of his
pocket, and putting his hand upon Mr. Warrington's shoulder, declares
him his prisoner. A hackney-coach is in attendance, and poor Harry goes
to sleep in Chancery Lane.

Oh, to think that a Virginian prince's back should be slapped by a
ragged bailiffs follower!--that Madam Esmond's son should be in a
spunging-house in Cursitor Street! I do not envy our young prodigal his
rest on that dismal night. Let us hit him now he is down, my beloved
young friends. Let us imagine the stings of remorse keeping him wakeful
on his dingy pillow; the horrid jollifications of other hardened inmates
of the place ringing in his ears from the room hard by, where they sit
boozing; the rage and shame and discomfiture. No pity on him, I say,
my honest young gentlemen, for you, of course, have never indulged in
extravagance or folly, or paid the reckoning of remorse.




CHAPTER XLVI. Chains and Slavery


Remorse for past misdeeds and follies Harry sincerely felt, when he
found himself a prisoner in that dismal lock-up house, and wrath and
annoyance at the idea of being subjected to the indignity of arrest; but
the present unpleasantry he felt sure could only be momentary. He had
twenty friends who would release him from his confinement: to which of
them should he apply, was the question. Mr. Draper, the man of business,
who had been so obsequious to him: his kind uncle the Baronet, who had
offered to make his house Harry's home, who loved him as a son: his
cousin Castlewood, who had won such large sums from him: his noble
friends at the Chocolate-House, his good Aunt Bernstein--any one of
these Harry felt sure would give him a help in his trouble, though some
of the relatives, perhaps, might administer to him a little scolding for
his imprudence. The main point was, that the matter should be transacted
quietly, for Mr. Warrington was anxious that as few as possible of the
public should know how a gentleman of his prodigious importance had been
subject to such a vulgar process as an arrest. As if the public does
not end by knowing everything it cares to know. As if the dinner I shall
have to-day, and the hole in the stocking which I wear at this present
writing, can be kept a secret from some enemy or other who has a mind
to pry it out--though my boots are on, and my door was locked when I
dressed myself! I mention that hole in the stocking for sake of example
merely. The world can pry out everything about us which it has a mind to
know. But then there is this consolation, which men will never accept
in their own cases, that the world doesn't care. Consider the amount of
scandal it has been forced to hear in its time, and how weary and blase
it must be of that kind of intelligence. You are taken to prison,
and fancy yourself indelibly disgraced? You are bankrupt under odd
circumstances? You drive a queer bargain with your friends and are found
out, and imagine the world will punish you? Psha! Your shame is only
vanity. Go and talk to the world as if nothing had happened, and nothing
has happened. Tumble down; brush the mud off your clothes; appear with
a smiling countenance, and nobody cares. Do you suppose Society is going
to take out its pocket-handkerchief and be inconsolable when you die?
Why should it care very much, then, whether your worship graces yourself
or disgraces yourself? Whatever happens it talks, meets, jokes, yawns,
has its dinner, pretty much as before. Therefore don't be so conceited
about yourself as to fancy your private affairs of so much importance,
mi fili. Whereas Mr. Harry Warrington chafed and fumed as though all the
world was tingling with the touch of that hand which had been laid on
his sublime shoulder.

"A pretty sensation my arrest must have created at the club!" thought
Harry. "I suppose that Mr. Selwyn will be cutting all sorts of jokes
about my misfortune, plague take him! Everybody round the table will
have heard of it. March will tremble about the bet I have with him;
and, faith, 'twill be difficult to pay him when I lose. They will all
be setting up a whoop of congratulation at the Savage, as they call me,
being taken prisoner. How shall I ever be able to appear in the world
again? Whom shall I ask to come to my help? No," thought he, with his
mingled acuteness and simplicity, "I will not send in the first instance
to any of my relations or my noble friends at White's. I will have
Sampson's counsel. He has often been in a similar predicament, and
will know how to advise me." Accordingly, as soon as the light of dawn
appeared, after an almost intolerable delay--for it seemed to Harry as
if the sun had forgotten to visit Cursitor Street in his rounds that
morning--and as soon as the inmates of the house of bondage were
stirring, Mr. Warrington despatched a messenger to his friend in Long
Acre, acquainting the chaplain with the calamity just befallen him,
and beseeching his reverence to give him the benefit of his advice and
consolation.

Mr. Warrington did not know, to be sure, that to send such a message to
the parson was as if he said, "I am fallen amongst the lions. Come
down, my dear friend, into the pit with me." Harry very likely thought
Sampson's difficulties were over; or, more likely still, was so much
engrossed with his own affairs and perplexities, as to bestow little
thought upon his neighbour's. Having sent off his missive, the captive's
mind was somewhat more at ease, and he condescended to call for
breakfast, which was brought to him presently. The attendant who served
him with his morning repast asked him whether he would order dinner, or
take his meal at Mrs. Bailiff's table with some other gentlemen? No.
Mr. Warrington would not order dinner. He should quit the place before
dinner-time, he informed the chamberlain who waited on him in that grim
tavern. The man went away, thinking no doubt that this was not the first
young gentleman who had announced that he was going away ere two hours
were over. "Well, if your honour does stay, there is good beef and
carrot at two o'clock," says the sceptic, and closes the door on Mr.
Harry and his solitary meditations.

Harry's messenger to Mr. Sampson brought back a message from that
gentleman to say that he would be with his patron as soon as might be:
but ten o'clock came, eleven o'clock, noon, and no Sampson. No Sampson
arrived, but about twelve Gumbo with a portmanteau of his master's
clothes, who flung himself, roaring with grief, at Harry's feet: and
with a thousand vows of fidelity, expressed himself ready to die, to
sell himself into slavery over again, to do anything to rescue his
beloved Master Harry from this calamitous position. Harry was touched
with the lad's expressions of affection, and told him to get up from
the ground where he was grovelling on his knees, embracing his master's.
"All you have to do, sir, is to give me my clothes to dress, and to hold
your tongue about this business. Mind you, not a word, sir, about it to
anybody!" says Mr. Warrington, severely.

"Oh no, sir, never to nobody!" says Gumbo, looking most solemnly, and
proceeded to dress his master carefully, who had need of a change and a
toilette after his yesterday's sudden capture, and night's dismal rest.
Accordingly Gumbo flung a dash of powder in Harry's hair, and arrayed
his master carefully and elegantly, so that he made Mr. Warrington look
as fine and splendid as if he had been stepping into his chair to go to
St. James's.

Indeed all that love and servility could do Mr. Gumbo faithfully did for
his master, for whom he had an extreme regard and attachment. But there
were certain things beyond Gumbo's power. He could not undo things which
were done already; and he could not help lying and excusing himself when
pressed upon points disagreeable to himself. The language of slaves is
lies (I mean black slaves and white). The creature slinks away and hides
with subterfuges, as a hunted animal runs to his covert at the sight
of man, the tyrant and pursuer. Strange relics of feudality, and
consequence of our ever-so-old social life! Our domestics (are they not
men, too, and brethren?) are all hypocrites before us. They never speak
naturally to us, or the whole truth. We should be indignant: we should
say, confound their impudence: we should turn them out of doors if they
did. But quo me rapis, O my unbridled hobby?

Well, the truth is, that as for swearing not to say a word about his
master's arrest--such an oath as that was impossible to keep for, with
a heart full of grief, indeed, but with a tongue that never could cease
wagging, bragging, joking, and lying, Mr. Gumbo had announced the
woeful circumstance to a prodigious number of his acquaintances already,
chiefly gentlemen of the shoulder-knot and worsted lace. We have
seen how he carried the news to Colonel Lambert's and Lord Wrotham's
servants: he had proclaimed it at the footman's club to which he
belonged, and which was frequented by the gentlemen of some of the first
nobility. He had subsequently condescended to partake of a mug of ale
in Sir Miles Warrington's butler's room, and there had repeated and
embellished the story. Then he had gone off to Madame Bernstein's
people, with some of whom he was on terms of affectionate intercourse,
and had informed that domestic circle of his grief and, his master being
captured, and there being no earthly call for his personal services that
evening, Gumbo had stepped up to Lord Castlewood's, and informed the
gentry there of the incident which had just come to pass. So when,
laying his hand on his heart, and with gushing floods of tears, Gumbo
says, in reply to his master's injunction, "Oh no, master! nebber to
nobody!" we are in a condition to judge of the degree of credibility
which ought to be given to the lad's statement.

The black had long completed his master's toilet: the dreary breakfast
was over: slow as the hours went to the prisoner, still they were
passing one after another, but no Sampson came in accordance with the
promise sent in the morning. At length, some time after noon, there
arrived, not Sampson, but a billet from him, sealed with a moist wafer,
and with the ink almost yet wet. The unlucky divine's letter ran as
follows:


"Oh, sir, dear sir, I have done all that a man can at the command and
in the behalf of his patron! You did not know, sir, to what you were
subjecting me, did you? Else, if I was to go to prison, why did I not
share yours, and why am I in a lock-up house three doors off?

"Yes. Such is the fact. As I was hastening to you, knowing full well the
danger to which I was subject:--but what danger will I not affront at
the call of such a benefactor as Mr. Warrington hath been to me?--I was
seized by two villains who had a writ against me, and who have lodged me
at Naboth's, hard by, and so close to your honour, that we could almost
hear each other across the garden walls of the respective houses where
we are confined.

"I had much and of importance to say, which I do not care to write down
on paper regarding your affairs. May they mend! May my cursed fortunes,
too, better themselves, is the prayer of--

"Your honour's afflicted Chaplain-in-Ordinary, J. S."


And now, as Mr. Sampson refuses to speak, it will be our duty to
acquaint the reader with those matters whereof the poor chaplain did not
care to discourse on paper.

Gumbo's loquacity had not reached so far as Long Acre, and Mr. Sampson
was ignorant of the extent of his patron's calamity until he received
Harry's letter and messenger from Chancery Lane. The divine was still
ardent with gratitude for the service Mr. Warrington had just conferred
on him, and eager to find some means to succour his distressed patron.
He knew what a large sum Lord Castlewood had won from his cousin, had
dined in company with his lordship on the day before, and now ran to
Lord Castlewood's house, with a hope of arousing him to some pity for
Mr. Warrington. Sampson made a very eloquent and touching speech to
Lord Castlewood about his kinsman's misfortune, and spoke with a real
kindness and sympathy, which, however, failed to touch the nobleman to
whom he addressed himself.

My lord peevishly and curtly put a stop to the chaplain's passionate
pleading. "Did I not tell you, two days since, when you came for money,
that I was as poor as a beggar, Sampson," said his lordship, "and has
anybody left me a fortune since? The little sum I won from my cousin was
swallowed up by others. I not only can't help Mr. Warrington, but, as I
pledge you my word, not being in the least aware of his calamity, I had
positively written to him this morning to ask him to help me." And
a letter to this effect did actually reach Mr. Warrington from his
lodgings, whither it had been despatched by the penny post.

"I must get him money, my lord. I know he had scarcely anything left in
his pocket after relieving me. Were I to pawn my cassock and bands, he
must have money," cried the chaplain.

"Amen. Go and pawn your bands, your cassock, anything you please. Your
enthusiasm does you credit," said my lord; and resumed the reading of
his paper, whilst, in the deepest despondency, poor Sampson left him.

My Lady Maria meanwhile had heard that the chaplain was with her
brother, and conjectured what might be the subject on which they had
been talking. She seized upon the parson as he issued from out his
fruitless interview with my lord. She drew him into the dining-room: the
strongest marks of grief and sympathy were in her countenance. "Tell me,
what is this has happened to Mr. Warrington?" she asked.

"Your ladyship, then, knows?" asked the chaplain.

"Have I not been in mortal anxiety ever since his servant brought the
dreadful news last night?" asked my lady. "We had it as we came from the
opera--from my Lady Yarmouth's box--my lord, my Lady Castlewood, and I."

"His lordship, then, did know?" continued Sampson.

"Benson told the news when we came from the playhouse to our tea,"
repeats Lady Maria.

The chaplain lost all patience and temper at such duplicity. "This
is too bad," he said, with an oath; and he told Lady Maria of the
conversation which he had just had with Lord Castlewood, and of the
latter's refusal to succour his cousin, after winning great sums of
money from him, and with much eloquence and feeling, of Mr. Warrington's
most generous behaviour to himself.

Then my Lady Maria broke out with a series of remarks regarding her own
family, which were by no means complimentary to her own kith and kin.
Although not accustomed to tell truth commonly, yet, when certain
families fall out, it is wonderful what a number of truths they will
tell about one another. With tears, imprecations, I do not like to
think how much stronger language, Lady Maria burst into a furious and
impassioned tirade, in which she touched upon the history of almost all
her noble family. She complimented the men and the ladies alike; she
shrieked out interrogatories to Heaven, inquiring why it had made such
(never mind what names she called her brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts,
parents); and, emboldened with wrath, she dashed at her brother's
library door, so shrill in her outcries, so furious in her demeanour,
that the alarmed chaplain, fearing the scene which might ensue, made for
the street.

My lord, looking up from the book or other occupation which engaged
him, regarded the furious woman with some surprise, and selected a good
strong oath to fling at her, as it were, and check her onset.

But, when roused, we have seen how courageous Maria could be. Afraid
as she was ordinarily of her brother, she was not in a mood to be
frightened now by any language of abuse or sarcasm at his command.

"So, my lord!" she called out, "you sit down with him in private to
cards, and pigeon him! You get the poor boy's last shilling, and you
won't give him a guinea out of his own winnings now he is penniless!"

"So that infernal chaplain has been telling tales!" says my lord.

"Dismiss him: do! Pay him his wages, and let him go,--he will be glad
enough!" cries Maria.

"I keep him to marry one of my sisters, in case he is wanted," says
Castlewood, glaring at her.

"What can the women be in a family where there are such men?" says the
lady.

"Effectivement!" says my lord, with a shrug of his shoulder.

"What can we be, when our fathers and brothers are what they are? We are
bad enough, but what are you? I say, you neither have courage--no, nor
honour, nor common feeling. As your equals won't play with you, my
Lord Castlewood, you must take this poor lad out of Virginia, your own
kinsman, and pigeon him! Oh, it's a shame--a shame!"

"We are all playing our own game, I suppose. Haven't you played and won
one, Maria? Is it you that are squeamish of a sudden about the poor
lad from Virginia? Has Mr. Harry cried off, or has your ladyship got
a better offer?" cried my Lord. "If you won't have him, one of the
Warrington girls will, I promise you; and the old Methodist woman in
Hill Street will give him the choice of either. Are you a fool, Maria
Esmond? A greater fool, I mean, than in common?"

"I should be a fool if I thought that either of my brothers could act
like an honest man, Eugene!" said Maria. "I am a fool to expect that you
will be other than you are; that if you find any relative in distress
you will help him; that if you can meet with a victim you won't fleece
him."

"Fleece him! Psha! What folly are you talking! Have you not seen, from
the course which the lad has been running for months past, how he would
end? If I had not won his money, some other would? I never grudged thee
thy little plans regarding him. Why shouldst thou fly in a passion,
because I have just put out my hand to take what he was offering to all
the world? I reason with you, I don't know why, Maria. You should be old
enough to understand reason, at any rate. You think this money belonged
of right to Lady Maria Warrington and her children? I tell you that in
three months more every shilling would have found its way to White's
macco-table, and that it is much better spent in paying my debts. So
much for your ladyship's anger, and tears, and menaces, and naughty
language. See! I am a good brother, and repay them with reason and kind
words."

"My good brother might have given a little more than kind words to the
lad from whom he has just taken hundreds," interposed the sister of this
affectionate brother.

"Great heavens, Maria! Don't you see that even out of this affair,
unpleasant as it seems, a clever woman may make her advantage," cries my
lord. Maria said she failed to comprehend.

"As thus. I name no names; I meddle in no person's business, having
quite enough to do to manage my own cursed affairs. But suppose I happen
to know of a case in another family which may be applicable to ours. It
is this. A green young lad of tolerable expectations, comes up from the
country to his friends in town--never mind from what country: never
mind to what town. An elderly female relative, who has been dragging her
spinsterhood about these--how many years shall we say?--extort a promise
of marriage from my young gentleman, never mind on what conditions."

"My lord, do you want to insult your sister as well as to injure your
cousin?" asks Maria.

"My good child, did I say a single word about fleecing or cheating, or
pigeoning, or did I fly into a passion when you insulted me? I know the
allowance that must be made for your temper, and the natural folly of
your sex. I say I treated you with soft words--I go on with my story.
The elderly relative extracts a promise of marriage from the young lad,
which my gentleman is quite unwilling to keep. No, he won't keep it.
He is utterly tired of his elderly relative: he will plead his mother's
refusal: he will do anything to get out of his promise."

"Yes; if he was one of us Esmonds, my Lord Castlewood. But this is a
man of honour we are speaking of," cried Maria, who, I suppose, admired
truth in others, however little she saw it in her own family.

"I do not contradict either of my dear sister's remarks. One of us
would fling the promise to the winds, especially as it does not exist in
writing."

"My lord!" gasps out Maria.

"Bah! I know all. That little coup of Tunbridge was played by the Aunt
Bernstein with excellent skill. The old woman is the best man of our
family. While you were arrested, your boxes were searched for the
Mohock's letters to you. When you were let loose, the letters had
disappeared, and you said nothing, like a wise woman, as you are
sometimes. You still hanker after your Cherokee. Soit. A woman of your
mature experience knows the value of a husband. What is this little loss
of two or three hundred pounds?"

"Not more than three hundred, my lord?" interposes Maria.

"Eh! never mind a hundred or two, more or less. What is this loss at
cards? A mere bagatelle! You are playing for a principality. You want
your kingdom in Virginia; and if you listen to my opinion, the little
misfortune which has happened to your swain is a piece of great
good-fortune to you."

"I don't understand you, my lord."

"C'est possible; but sit down, and I will explain what I mean in a
manner suited to your capacity." And so Maria Esmond, who had advanced
to her brother like a raging lion, now sate down at his feet like a
gentle lamb.


Madame de Bernstein was not a little moved at the news of her nephew's
arrest, which Mr. Gumbo brought to Clarges Street on the night of the
calamity. She would have cross-examined the black, and had further
particulars respecting Harry's mishap; but Mr. Gumbo, anxious to carry
his intelligence to other quarters, had vanished when her ladyship sent
for him. Her temper was not improved by the news, or by the sleepless
night which she spent. I do not envy the dame de compagnie who played
cards with her, or the servant who had to lie in her chamber. An arrest
was an everyday occurrence, as she knew very well as a woman of the
world. Into what difficulties had her scapegrace of a nephew fallen? How
much money should she be called upon to pay to release him? And had
he run through all his own? Provided he had not committed himself
very deeply, she was quite disposed to aid him. She liked even his
extravagances and follies. He was the only being in the world on whom,
for long, long years, that weary woman had been able to bestow a little
natural affection. So, on their different beds, she and Harry were lying
wakeful together; and quite early in the morning the messengers which
each sent forth on the same business may have crossed each other.

Madame Bernstein's messenger was despatched to the chambers of her man
of business, Mr. Draper, with an order that Mr. D. should ascertain for
what sums Mr. Warrington had been arrested, and forthwith repair to the
Baroness. Draper's emissaries speedily found out that Mr. Warrington was
locked up close beside them, and the amount of detainers against him
so far. Were there other creditors, as no doubt there were, they
would certainly close upon him when they were made acquainted with his
imprisonment.

To Mr. Sparks, the jeweller, for those unlucky presents, so much; to the
landlord in Bond Street, for board, fire, lodging, so much: these were
at present the only claims against Mr. Warrington, Mr. Draper found. He
was ready, at a signal from her ladyship, to settle them at a moment.
The jeweller's account ought especially to be paid, for Mr. Harry had
acted most imprudently in taking goods from Mr. Sparks on credit, and
pledging them with a pawnbroker. He must have been under some immediate
pressure for money; intended to redeem the goods immediately, meant
nothing but what was honourable of course; but the affair would have an
ugly look, if made public, and had better be settled out of hand. "There
cannot be the least difficulty regarding a thousand pounds more or less,
for a gentleman of Mr. Warrington's rank and expectations," said Madame
de Bernstein. Not the least: her ladyship knew very well that there
were funds belonging to Mr. Warrington, on which money could be at once
raised with her ladyship's guarantee.

Should he go that instant and settle the matter with Messrs. Amos? Mr.
Harry might be back to dine with her at two, and to confound the people
at the clubs, "who are no doubt rejoicing over his misfortunes," said
the compassionate Mr. Draper.

But the Baroness had other views. "I think, my good Mr. Draper," she
said, "that my young gentleman has sown wild oats enough; and when he
comes out of prison I should like him to come out clear, and without any
liabilities at all. You are not aware of all his."

"No gentleman ever does tell all his debts, madam," says Mr. Draper; "no
one I ever had to deal with."

"There is one which the silly boy has contracted, and from which he
ought to be released, Mr. Draper. You remember a little circumstance
which occurred at Tunbridge Wells in the autumn? About which I sent up
my man Case to you?"

"When your ladyship pleases to recall it, I remember it--not otherwise,"
says Mr. Draper, with a bow. "A lawyer should be like a Popish
confessor,--what is told him is a secret for ever, and for everybody."
So we must not whisper Madame Bernstein's secret to Mr. Draper; but the
reader may perhaps guess it from the lawyer's conduct subsequently.

The lawyer felt pretty certain that ere long he would receive a summons
from the poor young prisoner in Cursitor Street, and waited for that
invitation before he visited Mr. Warrington. Six-and-thirty hours passed
ere the invitation came, during which period Harry passed the dreariest
two days which he ever remembered to have spent.

There was no want of company in the lock-up house, the bailiff's rooms
were nearly always full; but Harry preferred the dingy solitude of his
own room to the society round his landlady's table, and it was only
on the second day of his arrest, and when his purse was emptied by the
heavy charges of the place, that he made up his mind to apply to
Mr. Draper. He despatched a letter then to the lawyer at the Temple,
informing him of his plight, and desiring him, in an emphatic
postscript, not to say one word about the matter to his aunt, Madame de
Bernstein.

He had made up his mind not to apply to the old lady except at the
very last extremity. She had treated him with so much kindness that he
revolted from the notion of trespassing on her bounty, and for a while
tried to please himself with the idea that he might get out of durance
without her even knowing that any misfortune at all had befallen him.
There seemed to him something humiliating in petitioning a woman for
money. No! He would apply first to his male friends, all of whom might
help him if they would. It had been his intention to send Sampson to one
or other of them as a negotiator, had not the poor fellow been captured
on his way to succour his friend.

Sampson gone, Harry was obliged to have recourse to his own negro
servant, who was kept on the trot all day between Temple Bar and the
Court end of the town with letters from his unlucky master. Firstly,
then, Harry sent off a most private and confidential letter to his
kinsman, the Right Honourable the Earl of Castlewood, saying how he had
been cast into prison, and begging Castlewood to lend him the amount
of the debt. "Please to keep my application, and the cause of it, a
profound secret from the dear ladies," wrote poor Harry.

"Was ever anything so unfortunate?" wrote back Lord Castlewood, in
reply. "I suppose you have not got my note of yesterday? It must be
lying at your lodgings, where--I hope in heaven!--you will soon be, too.
My dear Mr. Warrington, thinking you were as rich as Croesus--otherwise
I never should have sate down to cards with you--I wrote to you
yesterday, begging you to lend me some money to appease some hungry duns
whom I don't know how else to pacify. My poor fellow! every shilling
of your money went to them, and but for my peer's privilege I might be
hob-and-nob with you now in your dungeon. May you soon escape from it,
is the prayer of your sincere CASTLEWOOD."

This was the result of application number one: and we may imagine that
Mr. Harry read the reply to his petition with rather a blank face. Never
mind! There was kind, jolly Uncle Warrington. Only last night his aunt
had kissed him and loved him like a son. His uncle had called down
blessings on his head, and professed quite a paternal regard for him.
With a feeling of shyness and modesty in presence of those virtuous
parents and family. Harry had never said a word about his wild doings,
or his horse-racings, or his gamblings, or his extravagances. It must
all out now. He must confess himself a Prodigal and a Sinner, and ask
for their forgiveness and aid. So Prodigal sate down and composed a
penitent letter to Uncle Warrington, and exposed his sad case, and
besought him to come to the rescue. Was not that a bitter nut to crack
for our haughty young Virginian? Hours of mortification and profound
thought as to the pathos of the composition did Harry pass over that
letter; sheet after sheet of Mr. Amos's sixpence-a-sheet letter-paper
did he tear up before the missive was complete, with which poor
blubbering Gumbo (much vilified by the bailiff's followers and
parasites, whom he was robbing, as they conceived, of their perquisites)
went his way.

At evening the faithful negro brought back a thick letter in his aunt's
handwriting. Harry opened the letter with a trembling hand. He thought
it was full of bank-notes. Ah me! it contained a sermon (Daniel in the
Lions' Den) by Mr. Whitfield, and a letter from Lady Warrington saying
that, in Sir Miles's absence from London, she was in the habit of
opening his letters, and hence, perforce, was become acquainted with a
fact which she deplored from her inmost soul to learn, namely, that her
nephew Warrington had been extravagant and was in debt. Of course, in
the absence of Sir Miles, she could not hope to have at command such
a sum as that for which Mr. Warrington wrote, but she sent him her
heartfelt prayers, her deepest commiseration, and a discourse by dear
Mr. Whitfield, which would comfort him in his present (alas! she feared
not undeserved) calamity. She added profuse references to particular
Scriptural chapters which would do him good. If she might speak of
things worldly, she said, at such a moment, she would hint to Mr.
Warrington that his epistolary orthography was anything but correct. She
would not fail for her part to comply with his express desire that his
dear cousins should know nothing of this most painful circumstance,
and with every wish for his welfare here and elsewhere, she subscribed
herself his loving aunt, MARGARET WARRINGTON.

Poor Harry hid his face between his hands, and sate for a while with
elbows on the greasy table blankly staring into the candle before him.
The bailiff's servant, who was touched by his handsome face, suggested a
mug of beer for his honour, but Harry could not drink, nor eat the meat
that was placed before him. Gumbo, however, could, whose grief did not
deprive him of appetite, and who, blubbering the while, finished all
the beer, and all the bread and the meat. Meanwhile, Harry had finished
another letter, with which Gumbo was commissioned to start again, and
away the faithful creature ran upon his errand.

Gumbo ran as far as White's Club, to which house he was ordered in the
first instance to carry the letter, and where he found the person
to whom it was addressed. Even the prisoner, for whom time passed so
slowly, was surprised at the celerity with which his negro had performed
his errand.

At least the letter which Harry expected had not taken long to write.
"My lord wrote it at the hall-porter's desk, while I stood there then
with Mr Mr. Morris," said Gumbo, and the letter was to this effect:--


"DEAR SIR--I am sorry I cannot comply with your wish, I'm short of
money at present, having paid large sums to you as well as to other
gentlemen.--Yours obediently, MARCH AND R.

"Henry Warrington, Esq."


"Did Lord March say anything?" asked Mr. Warrington looking very pale.

"He say it was the coolest thing he ever knew. So did Mr. Morris. He
showed him your letter, Master Harry. Yes, Mr. Morris say, 'Dam his
imperence!'" added Gumbo.

Harry burst into such a yell of laughter that his landlord thought he
had good news, and ran in in alarm lest he was about to lose his tenant.
But by this time poor Harry's laughter was over, and he was flung down
in his chair gazing dismally in the fire.

"I--I should like to smoke a pipe of Virginia" he groaned.

Gumbo burst into tears: he flung himself at Harry's knees. He kissed his
knees and his hands. "Oh, master, my dear master, what will they say at
home?" he sobbed out.

The jailor was touched at the sight of the black's grief and fidelity,
and at Harry's pale face as he sank back in his chair quite overcome and
beaten by his calamity.

"Your honour ain't eat anything these two days," the man said, in a
voice of rough pity. "Pluck up a little, sir. You aren't the first
gentleman who has been in and out of grief before this. Let me go down
and get you a glass of punch and a little supper."

"My good friend," said Harry, a sickly smile playing over his white
face, "you pay ready money for everything in this house, don't you? I
must tell you that I haven't a shilling left to buy a dish of meat. All
the money I have I want for letter-paper."

"Oh, master, my master!" roared out Gumbo. "Look here, my dear Master
Harry! Here's plenty of money--here's twenty-three five-guineas. Here's
gold moidore from Virginia--here--no, not that--that's keepsakes the
girls gave me. Take everything--everything. I go sell myself to-morrow
morning; but here's plenty for to-night, master!"

"God bless you, Gumbo!" Harry said, laying his hand on the lad's woolly
head. "You are free if I am not, and Heaven forbid I should not take the
offered help of such a friend as you. Bring me some supper: but the pipe
too, mind--the pipe too!" And Harry ate his supper with a relish: and
even the turnkeys and bailiff's followers, when Gumbo went out of the
house that night, shook hands with him, and ever after treated him well.




CHAPTER XLVII. Visitors in Trouble


Mr. Gumbo's generous and feeling conduct soothed and softened the angry
heart of his master, and Harry's second night in the spunging-house was
passed more pleasantly than the first. Somebody at least there was to
help and compassionate with him. Still, though softened in that one
particular spot, Harry's heart was hard and proud towards almost all
the rest of the world. They were selfish and ungenerous, he thought.
His pious Aunt Warrington, his lordly friend March, his cynical cousin
Castlewood,--all had been tried, and were found wanting. Not to avoid
twenty years of prison would he stoop to ask a favour of one of them
again. Fool that he had been, to believe in their promises, and confide
in their friendship! There was no friendship in this cursed, cold,
selfish country. He would leave it. He would trust no Englishman, great
or small. He would go to Germany, and make a campaign with the king; or
he would go home to Virginia, bury himself in the woods there, and
hunt all day; become his mother's factor and land-steward; marry Polly
Broadbent, or Fanny Mountain; turn regular tobacco-grower and farmer; do
anything, rather than remain amongst these English fine gentlemen. So he
arose with an outwardly cheerful countenance, but an angry spirit; and
at an early hour in the morning the faithful Gumbo was in attendance
in his master's chamber, having come from Bond Street, and brought Mr.
Harry's letters thence. "I wanted to bring some more clothes," honest
Gumbo said; "but Mr. Ruff, the landlord, he wouldn't let me bring no
more."

Harry did not care to look at the letters: he opened one, two, three;
they were all bills. He opened a fourth; it was from the landlord, to
say that he would allow no more of Mr. Warrington's things to go out of
the house,--that unless his bill was paid he should sell Mr. W.'s goods
and pay himself: and that his black man must go and sleep elsewhere. He
would hardly let Gumbo take his own clothes and portmanteau away. The
black said he had found refuge elsewhere--with some friends at Lord
Wrotham's house. "With Colonel Lambert's people," says Mr. Gumbo,
looking very hard at his master. "And Miss Hetty she fall down in a
faint, when she hear you taken up; and Mr. Lambert, he very good man,
and he say to me this morning, he say, 'Gumbo, you tell your master if
he want me he send to me, and I come to him.'"

Harry was touched when he heard that Hetty had been afflicted by his
misfortune. He did not believe Gumbo's story about her fainting; he
was accustomed to translate his black's language and to allow for
exaggeration. But when Gumbo spoke of the Colonel the young Virginian's
spirit was darkened again. "I send to Lambert" he thought, grinding his
teeth, "the man who insulted me, and flung my presents back in my face!
If I were starving I would not ask him for a crust!" And presently,
being dressed, Mr. Warrington called for his breakfast, and despatched
Gumbo with a brief note to Mr. Draper in the Temple, requiring that
gentleman's attendance.

"The note was as haughty as if he was writing to one of his negroes, and
not to a freeborn English gentleman," Draper said; whom indeed Harry had
always treated with insufferable condescension. "It's all very well
for a fine gentleman to give himself airs; but for a fellow in a
spunging-house! Hang him!" says Draper, "I've a great mind not to
go!" Nevertheless, Mr. Draper did go, and found Mr. Warrington in his
misfortune even more arrogant than he had ever been in the days of his
utmost prosperity. Mr. W. sat on his bed, like a lord, in a splendid
gown with his hair dressed. He motioned his black man to fetch him a
chair.

"Excuse me, madam, but such haughtiness and airs I ain't accustomed to!"
said the outraged attorney.

"Take a chair and go on with your story, my good Mr. Draper!" said
Madame de Bernstein, smiling, to whom he went to report proceedings.
She was amused at the lawyer's anger. She liked her nephew for being
insolent in adversity.

The course which Draper was to pursue in his interview with Harry
had been arranged between the Baroness and her man of business on the
previous day. Draper was an able man, and likely in most cases to do a
client good service: he failed in the present instance because he was
piqued and angry, or, more likely still, because he could not understand
the gentleman with whom he had to deal. I presume that he who casts his
eye on the present page is the most gentle of readers. Gentleman, as
you unquestionably are, then, my dear sir, have you not remarked in
your dealings with people who are no gentlemen, that you offend them not
knowing the how or the why? So the man who is no gentleman offends you
in a thousand ways of which the poor creature has no idea himself. He
does or says something which provokes your scorn. He perceives that
scorn (being always on the watch, and uneasy about himself, his manners
and behaviour) and he rages. You speak to him naturally, and he fancies
still that you are sneering at him. You have indifference towards
him, but he hates you, and hates you the worse because you don't
care. "Gumbo, a chair to Mr. Draper!" says Mr. Warrington, folding his
brocaded dressing-gown round his legs as he sits on the dingy bed. "Sit
down, if you please, and let us talk my business over. Much obliged to
you for coming so soon in reply to my message. Had you heard of this
piece of ill-luck before?"

Mr. Draper had heard of the circumstance. "Bad news travel quick, Mr.
Warrington," he said; "and I was eager to offer my humble services as
soon as ever you should require them. Your friends, your family, will be
much pained that a gentleman of your rank should be in such a position."

"I have been very imprudent, Mr. Draper. I have lived beyond my means."
(Mr. Draper bowed.) "I played in company with gentlemen who were much
richer than myself, and a cursed run of ill-luck has carried away all my
ready money, leaving me with liabilities to the amount of five hundred
pounds, and more."

"Five hundred now in the office," says Mr. Draper.

"Well, this is such a trifle that I thought by sending to one or two
friends, yesterday, I could have paid my debt and gone home without
further to do. I have been mistaken; and will thank you to have the
kindness to put me in the way of raising the money as soon as may be."

Mr. Draper said "Hm!" and pulled a very grave and long face.

"Why, sir, it can be done!" says Mr. Warrington, staring at the lawyer.

It not only could be done, but Mr. Draper had proposed to Madame
Bernstein on the day before instantly to pay the money, and release
Mr. Warrington. That lady had declared she intended to make the young
gentleman her heir. In common with the rest of the world, Draper
believed Harry's hereditary property in Virginia to be as great in
money-value as in extent. He had notes in his pocket, and Madame
Bernstein's order to pay them under certain conditions: nevertheless,
when Harry said, "It can be done!" Draper pulled his long face, and
said, "It can be done in time, sir; but it will require a considerable
time. To touch the property in England which is yours on Mr. George
Warrington's death, we must have the event proved, the trustees
released: and who is to do either? Lady Esmond Warrington in Virginia,
of course, will not allow her son to remain in prison, but we must wait
six months before we hear from her. Has your Bristol agent any authority
to honour your drafts?"

"He is only authorised to pay me two hundred pounds a year," says Mr.
Warrington. "I suppose I have no resource, then, but to apply to my
aunt, Madame de Bernstein. She will be my security."

"Her ladyship will do anything for you, sir; she has said so to me,
often and often," said the lawyer; "and, if she gives the word at that
moment you can walk out of this place."

"Go to her, then, from me, Mr. Draper. I did not want to have troubled
my relations: but rather than continue in this horrible needless
imprisonment, I must speak to her. Say where I am, and what has befallen
me. Disguise nothing! And tell her, that I confide in her affection
and kindness for me to release me from this--this disgrace," and Mr.
Warrington's voice shook a little, and he passed his hand across his
eyes.

"Sir," says Mr. Draper, eyeing the young man, "I was with her ladyship
yesterday, when we talked over the whole of this here most unpleasant--I
won't say as you do, disgraceful business."

"What do you mean, sir? Does Madame de Bernstein know of my misfortune?"
asked Harry.

"Every circumstance, sir; the pawning the watches, and all."

Harry turned burning red. "It is an unfortunate business, the pawning
them watches and things which you had never paid for," continued the
lawyer. The young man started up from the bed, looking so fierce that
Draper felt a little alarmed.

"It may lead to litigation and unpleasant remarks being made, in court,
sir. Them barristers respect nothing; and when they get a feller in the
box----"

"Great Heaven, sir, you don't suppose a gentleman of my rank can't take
a watch upon credit without intending to cheat the tradesman?" cried
Harry, in the greatest agitation.

"Of course you meant everything that's honourable; only, you see, the
law mayn't happen to think so," says Mr. Draper, winking his eye. ("Hang
the supercilious beast; I touch him there!) Your aunt says it's the most
imprudent thing ever she heard of--to call it by no worse name."

"You call it by no worse name yourself, Mr. Draper?" says Harry,
speaking each word very slow, and evidently trying to keep a command of
himself.

Draper did not like his looks. "Heaven forbid that I should say anything
as between gentleman and gentleman,--but between me and my client, it's
my duty to say, 'Sir, you are in a very unpleasant scrape,' just as a
doctor would have to tell his patient, 'Sir, you are very ill.'"

"And you can't help me to pay this debt off,--and you have come only to
tell me that I may be accused of roguery?" says Harry.

"Of obtaining goods under false pretences? Most undoubtedly, yes. I
can't help it, sir. Don't look as if you would knock me down. (Curse
him, I am making him wince, though.) A young gentleman, who has only two
hundred a year from his ma', orders diamonds and watches, and takes 'em
to a pawnbroker. You ask me what people will think of such behaviour,
and I tell you honestly. Don't be angry with me, Mr. Warrington."

"Go on, sir!" says Harry, with a groan.

The lawyer thought the day was his own. "But you ask if I can't help
to pay this debt off? And I say Yes--and that here is the money in my
pocket to do it now, if you like--not mine, sir, my honoured client's,
your aunt, Lady Bernstein. But she has a right to impose her conditions,
and I've brought 'em with me."

"Tell them, sir," says Mr. Harry.

"They are not hard. They are only for your own good: and if you say Yes,
we can call a hackney-coach, and go to Clarges Street together, which
I have promised to go there, whether you will or no. Mr. Warrington, I
name no names, but there was a question of marriage between you and a
certain party."

"Ah!" said Harry; and his countenance looked more cheerful than it had
yet done.

"To that marriage my noble client, the Baroness, is most averse--having
other views for you, and thinking it will be your ruin to marry a
party,--of noble birth and title it is true; but, excuse me, not of
first-rate character, and so much older than yourself. You had given an
imprudent promise to that party."

"Yes; and she has it still," says Mr. Warrington.

"It has been recovered. She dropped it by an accident at Tunbridge,"
says Mr. Draper, "so my client informed me; indeed her ladyship showed
it me, for the matter of that. It was wrote in bl----"

"Never mind, sir!" cries Harry, turning almost as red as the ink which
he had used to write his absurd promise, of which the madness and folly
had smote him with shame a thousand times over.

"At the same time letters, wrote to you, and compromising a noble
family, were recovered," continues the lawyer. "You had lost 'em. It was
no fault of yours. You were away when they were found again. You may
say that that noble family, that you yourself, have a friend such as few
young men have. Well, sir, there's no earthly promise to bind you--only
so many idle words said over a bottle, which very likely any gentleman
may forget. Say you won't go on with this marriage--give me and my noble
friend your word of honour. Cry off, I say, Mr. W.! Don't be such a
d----fool, saving your presence, as to marry an old woman who has jilted
scores of men in her time. Say the word, and I step downstairs, pay
every shilling against you in the office, and put you down in my coach,
either at your aunt's or at White's Club, if you like, with a couple of
hundred in your pocket. Say yes; and give us your hand! There's no use
in sitting grinning behind these bars all day!"

So far Mr. Draper had had the best of the talk. Harry only longed
himself to be rid of the engagement from which his aunt wanted to free
him. His foolish flame for Maria Esmond had died out long since. If she
would release him, how thankful would he be! "Come! give us your hand,
and say done!" says the lawyer, with a knowing wink. "Don't stand
shilly-shallying, sir. Law bless you, Mr. W., if I had married everybody
I promised, I should be like the Grand Turk, or Captain Macheath in the
play!"

The lawyer's familiarity disgusted Harry, who shrank from Draper,
scarcely knowing that he did so. He folded his dressing gown round him,
and stepped back from the other's proffered hand. "Give me a little time
to think of the matter, if you please, Mr. Draper," he said, "and have
the goodness to come to me again in an hour.

"Very good, sir, very good, sir!" says the lawyer, biting his lips, and,
as he seized up his hat, turning very red. "Most parties would not want
an hour to consider about such an offer as I make you: but I suppose my
time must be yours, and I'll come again, and see whether you are to
go or to stay. Good morning, sir, good morning:" and he went his way,
growling curses down the stairs. "Won't take my hand, won't he? Will
tell me in an hour's time! Hang his impudence! I'll show him what an
hour is!"

Mr. Draper went to his chambers in dudgeon then; bullied his clerks all
round, sent off a messenger to the Baroness, to say that he had
waited on the young gentleman, who had demanded a little time for
consideration, which was for form's sake, as he had no doubt; the lawyer
then saw clients, transacted business, went out to his dinner in the
most leisurely manner; and then finally turned his steps towards the
neighbouring Cursitor Street. "He'll be at home when I call, the haughty
beast!" says Draper, with a sneer. "The Fortunate Youth in his room?"
the lawyer asked of the sheriff's officer's aide-de-camp who came to
open the double doors.

"Mr. Warrington is in his apartment," said the gentleman, "but----" and
here the gentleman winked at Mr. Draper, and laid his hand on his nose.

"But what, Mr. Paddy from Cork?" said the lawyer.

"My name is Costigan; me familee is noble, and me neetive place is the
Irish methrawpolis, Mr. Six-and-eightpence!" said the janitor, scowling
at Draper. A rich odour of spirituous liquors filled the little space
between the double doors where he held the attorney in conversation.

"Confound you, sir, let me pass!" bawled out Mr. Draper.

"I can hear you perfectly well, Six-and-eightpence, except your h's,
which you dthrop out of your conversation. I'll thank ye not to call
neems, me good friend, or me fingers and your nose will have to make an
intimate hic-quaintance. Walk in, sir! Be polite for the future to your
shupariors in birth and manners, though they may be your infariors in
temporary station. Confound the kay! Walk in, sir, I say!--Madam, I have
the honour of saluting ye most respectfully!"

A lady with her face covered with a capuchin, and further hidden by her
handkerchief, uttered a little exclamation as of alarm as she came down
the stairs at this instant and hurried past the lawyer. He was pressing
forward to look at her--for Mr. Draper was very cavalier in his manners
to women--but the bailiff's follower thrust his leg between Draper and
the retreating lady, crying, "Keep your own distance, if you plaise!
This way, madam! I at once recognised your ladysh----" Here he closed
the door on Draper's nose, and left that attorney to find his own way to
his client upstairs.

At six o'clock that evening the old Baroness de Bernstein was pacing up
and down her drawing-crutch, and for ever running to the window when the
noise of a coach was heard passing in Clarges Street. She had delayed
her dinner from hour to hour: she who scolded so fiercely, on ordinary
occasions, if her cook was five minutes after his time. She had ordered
two covers to be laid, plate to be set out, and some extra dishes to be
prepared as if for a little fete. Four--five o'clock passed, and at six
she looked from the window, and a coach actually stopped at her door.

"Mr. Draper" was announced, and entered bowing profoundly.

The old lady trembled on her stick. "Where is the boy?" she said
quickly. "I told you to bring him, sir! How dare you come without him?"

"It is not my fault, madam, that Mr. Warrington refuses to come." And
Draper gave his version of the interview which had just taken place
between himself and the young Virginian.




CHAPTER XLVIII. An Apparition


Going off in his wrath from his morning's conversation with Harry,
Mr. Draper thought he heard the young prisoner speak behind him; and,
indeed, Harry had risen, and uttered a half-exclamation to call the
lawyer back. But he was proud, and the other offended: Harry checked
words, and Draper did not choose to stop. It wound Harry's pride to be
obliged to humble himself before the lawyer, and to have to yield from
mere lack and desire of money. "An hour hence will do as well," thought
Harry, and lapsed sulkily on to the bed again. No, he did not care
for Maria Esmond! No: he was ashamed of the way in which he had been
entrapped into that engagement. A wily and experienced woman, she had
cheated his boyish ardour. She had taken unfair advantage of him, as her
brother had at play. They were his own flesh and blood, and they ought
to have spared him. Instead, one and the other had made a prey of
him, and had used him for their selfish ends. He thought how they had
betrayed the rights of hospitality: how they had made a victim of the
young kinsman who came confiding within their gates. His heart was sore
wounded: his head sank back on his pillow: bitter tears wetted it.
"Had they come to Virginia," he thought, "I had given them a different
welcome!"

He was roused from this mood of despondency by Gumbo's grinning face at
his door, who said a lady was come to see Master Harry, and behind the
lad came the lady in the capuchin, of whom we have just made mention.
Harry sat up, pale and haggard, on his bed. The lady, with a sob, and
almost ere the servant-man withdrew, ran towards the young prisoner,
put her arms round his neck with real emotion and a maternal tenderness,
sobbed over his pale cheek and kissed it in the midst of plentiful
tears, and cried out--

"Oh, my Harry! Did I ever, ever think to see thee here?"

He started back, scared as it seemed at her presence, but she sank down
at the bedside, and seized his feverish hand, and embraced his knees.
She had a real regard and tenderness for him. The wretched place in
which she found him, his wretched look, filled her heart with a sincere
love and pity.

"I--I thought none of you would come!" said poor Harry, with a groan.

More tears, more kisses of the hot young hand, more clasps and pressure
with hers, were the lady's reply for a moment or two.

"Oh, my dear! my dear! I cannot bear to think of thee in misery," she
sobbed out.

Hardened though it might be, that heart was not all marble--that dreary
life not all desert. Harry's mother could not have been fonder, nor her
tones more tender than those of his kinswoman now kneeling at his feet.

"Some of the debts, I fear, were owing to my extravagance!" she said
(and this was true). "You bought trinkets and jewels in order to give me
pleasure. Oh, how I hate them now! I little thought I ever could! I have
brought them all with me, and more trinkets--here! and here! and all the
money I have in the world!"

And she poured brooches, rings, a watch, and a score or so of guineas
into Harry's lap. The sight of which strangely agitated and immensely
touched the young man.

"Dearest, kindest cousin!" he sobbed out.
