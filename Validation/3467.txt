church of St. Isaac could not hold those who
wished to attend the service.  Soon after, a public
subscription was raised among all the children
of Russia, who erected a monument in the
Summer Garden at Moscow.

There the old man sits in bronze, as he used to
sit at his window, clad in his beloved dressing
gown, an open book in his hand.

Around the monument (says his biographer) a
number of children are always at play, and the
poet seems to smile benignly on them from his
bronze easy chair.  Perhaps the Grecian children
of long ago played about Aesop's statue in Athens,
for Lysippus the celebrated sculptor designed and
erected a monument in his memory.

Read Krilof's "Education of a Lion" and
"The Lion and the Mosquitoes" while his life is
fresh in your mind.  Then turn to "What
Employment our Lord Gave to Insects" and "How
Sense was Distributed," in the quaint African
fables.  Glance at "The  Long-tailed
Spectacled Monkey" and "The Tune that Made the
Tiger Drowsy," so full of the very atmosphere of
India.  Then re-read some old favourite of
Aesop and imagine you are hearing his voice, or
that of some Greek story-teller of his day, ringing
down through more than two thousand years
of time.

There is a deal of preaching in all these fables,--that
cannot be denied,--but it is concealed as
well as possible.  It is so disagreeable for people
to listen while their faults and follies, their foibles
and failings, are enumerated, that the fable-maker
told his truths in story form and thereby
increased his audience.  Preaching from the mouths
of animals is not nearly so trying as when it
comes from the pulpit, or from the lips of your
own family and friends!

Whether or not our Grecian and Indian, African
and Russian fable-makers have not saddled the
animals with a few more faults than they possess--just
to bolster up our pride in human nature--I
sometimes wonder; but the result has been beneficial.
The human rascals and rogues see themselves
clearly reflected in the doings of the jackals,
foxes, and wolves and may get some little distaste
for lying, deceit and trickery.

We make few fables now-a-days.  We might
say that it is a lost art, but perhaps the world is too
old to be taught in that precise way, and though
the story writers are as busy as ever, the
story-tellers (alas!) are growing fewer and fewer.

If your ear has been opened by faery tales you
will have learned already to listen to and interpret
a hundred voices unheard by others.  A
comprehension of faery language leads one to
understand animal conversation with perfect ease, so
open the little green doors that lead into the forest,
the true Land of Fable.  Open them softly and
you will hear the Beasts talk Wisdom.

THE FABLES OF AESOP

  "'Twas the Golden Age when every brute
  Had voice articulate, in speech was skilled,
  And the mid-forests with its synods filled.
  The tongues of rock and pine-leaf then were free;
  To ship and sailor then would speak the sea;
  Sparrows with farmers would shrewd talk maintain;
  Earth gave all fruits, nor asked for toil again.
  Mortals and gods were wont to mix as friends--
  To which conclusion all the teaching tends
  Of sage old Aesop."

THE FABLES OF AESOP

The Power of Fables

Demades, a famous Greek orator, was once addressing an assembly at
Athens on a subject of great importance, and in vain tried to fix the
attention of his hearers.  They laughed among themselves, watched the
sports of the children, and in twenty other ways showed their want of
interest in the subject of the discourse.

Demades, after a short pause, spoke as follows:

"Ceres one day journeyed in company with a Swallow and an Eel."  At
this there was marked attention and every ear strained now to catch the
words of the orator.  "The party came to a river," continued he; "the
Eel swam across, and the Swallow flew over."  He then resumed the
subject of his harangue.

A great cry, however, arose from the people, "And Ceres? and Ceres?"
cried they.  "What did Ceres do?"

"Why, the goddess was, as she is now," replied he, "mightily offended
that people should have their ears open to any sort of foolery, and
shut to words of truth and wisdom."



The Wolf and the Lamb

A hungry Wolf one day saw a Lamb drinking at a stream, and wished to
frame some plausible excuse for making him his prey.

"What do you mean by muddling the water I am going to drink?" fiercely
said he to the Lamb.

"Pray forgive me," meekly answered the Lamb; "I should be sorry in any
way to displease you, but as the stream runs from you toward me, you
will see that such cannot be the case."

"That's all very well," said the Wolf; "but you know you spoke ill of
me behind my back a year ago."

"Nay, believe me," replied the Lamb, "I was not then born."

"It must have been your brother, then," growled the Wolf.

"It cannot have been, for I never had any," answered the Lamb.

"I know it was one of your lot," rejoined the Wolf, "so make no more
such idle excuses."  He then seized the poor Lamb, carried him off to
the woods, and ate him, but before the poor creature died he gasped
out, feebly, "Any excuse will serve a tyrant."



Aesop and His Fellow Servants

A merchant, who was at one time Aesop's master, on a certain occasion
ordered all things to be made ready for an intended journey.  When the
burdens were divided among the Servants, Aesop asked that he might have
the lightest.  He was told to choose for himself, and he took up the
basket of bread.  The other Servants laughed, for that was the largest
and heaviest of all the burdens.

When dinner-time came, Aesop, who had with some difficulty sustained
his load, was told to distribute an equal share all around.  He did so,
and this lightened his burden one half, and when supper-time arrived he
got rid of the rest.

For the remainder of the journey he had nothing but the empty basket to
carry, and the other Servants, whose loads seemed to get heavier and
heavier at every step, could not but applaud his ingenuity.



The Kite and the Pigeons

A Kite, that had kept sailing around a dovecote for many days to no
purpose, was at last forced by hunger to have recourse to stratagem.
Approaching the Pigeons in his gentlest manner, he described to them in
an eloquent speech how much better their state would be if they had a
king with some firmness about him, and how well such a ruler would
shield them from the attacks of the Hawk and other enemies.

The Pigeons, deluded by this show of reason, admitted him to the
dovecote as their king.  They found, however, that he thought it part
of his kingly prerogative to eat one of their number every day, and
they soon repented of their credulity in having let him in.



The Ant and the Fly

An Ant and a Fly one day disputed as to their respective merits.  "Vile
creeping insect!" said the Fly to the Ant, "can you for a moment
compare yourself with me?  I soar on the wing like a bird.  I enter the
palaces of kings, and alight on the heads of princes, nay, of emperors,
and only quit them to adorn the yet more attractive brow of beauty.
Besides, I visit the altars of the gods.  Not a sacrifice is offered
but it is first tasted by me.  Every feast, too, is open to me.  I eat
and drink of the best, instead of living for days on two or three
grains of corn as you do."

"All that is very fine," replied the Ant; "but listen to me.  You boast
of your feasting, but you know that your diet is not always so choice,
and you are sometimes forced to eat what nothing would induce me to
touch.  As for alighting on the heads of kings and emperors, you know
very well that whether you pitch on the head of an emperor or of an ass
(and it is as often on the one as the other), you are shaken off from
both with impatience.  And, then, the 'altars of the gods,' indeed!
There and everywhere else you are looked upon as nothing but a
nuisance.  In the winter, too, while I feed at my ease on the fruit of
my toil, what more common than to see your friends dying with cold,
hunger, and fatigue?  I lose my time now in talking to you.  Chattering
will fill neither my bin nor my cupboard."



The Frog Who Wished to Be as Big as an Ox

An Ox, grazing in a meadow, chanced to set his foot on a young Frog and
crushed him to death.  His brothers and sisters, who were playing near,
at once ran to tell their mother what had happened.

"The monster that did it, mother, was such a size!" said they.

The mother, who was a vain old thing, thought that she could easily
make herself as large.

"Was it as big as this?" she asked, blowing and puffing herself out.

"Oh, much bigger than that," replied the young Frogs.

"As this, then?" cried she, puffing and blowing again with all her
might.

"Nay, mother," said they; "if you were to try till you burst yourself,
you could never be so big."

The silly old Frog then tried to puff herself out still more, and burst
herself indeed.



The Cat and the Mice

A certain house was overrun with mice.  A Cat, discovering this, made
her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one.

The Mice being continually devoured, kept themselves close in their
holes.

The Cat, no longer able to get at them, perceived that she must tempt
them forth by some device.  For this purpose she jumped upon a peg,
and, suspending herself from it, pretended to be dead.

One of the Mice, peeping stealthily out, saw her, and said, "Ah, my
good madam, even though you should turn into a meal-bag, we would not
come near you."



The Cock and the Jewel

A brisk young Cock, scratching for something with which to entertain
his favourite Hens, happened to turn up a Jewel.  Feeling quite sure
that it was something precious, but not knowing well what to do with
it, he addressed it with an air of affected wisdom, as follows: "You
are a very fine thing, no doubt, but you are not at all to my taste.
For my part, I would rather have one grain of dear delicious barley
than all the Jewels in the world."



The Man and the Lion

A Man and a Lion were discussing the relative strength of men and lions
in general, the Man contending that he and his fellows were stronger
than lions by reason of their greater intelligence.

"Come now with me," he cried to the beast, "and I will soon prove that
I am right."  So he took him into the public gardens and showed him a
statue of Hercules overcoming the Lion.  and tearing him to pieces.

"That is all very well," said the Lion, "but it proves nothing, for it
was a man who made the statue!"



The Discontented Ass

In the depth of winter a poor Ass once prayed heartily for the spring,
that he might exchange a cold lodging and a heartless truss of straw
for a little warm weather and a mouthful of fresh grass.  In a short
time, according to his wish, the warm weather and the fresh grass came
on, but brought with them so much toil and business that he was soon as
weary of the spring as before of the winter, and he now became
impatient for the approach of summer.  The summer arrived; but the
heat, the harvest work and other drudgeries and inconveniences of the
season set him as far from happiness as before, which he now flattered
himself would be found in the plenty of autumn.  But here, too, he was
disappointed; for what with the carrying of apples, roots, fuel for the
winter, and other provisions, he was in autumn more fatigued than ever.

Having thus trod around the circle of the year, in a course of restless
labour, uneasiness and disappointment, and found no season, nor station
of life without its business and its trouble, he was forced at last to
acquiesce in the comfortless season of winter, where his complaint
began, convinced that in this world every situation has its
inconvenience.



The Boasting Traveller

A Man was one day entertaining a lot of fellows in an ale-house with an
account of the wonders he had done when abroad on his travels.  "I was
once at Rhodes," said he, "and the people of Rhodes, you know, are
famous for jumping.  Well, I took a jump there that no other man could
come within a yard of.  That's a fact, and if we were there I could
bring you ten men who would prove it."

"What need is there to go to Rhodes for witnesses?" asked one of his
hearers; "just imagine that you are there now, and show us your leap!"



The Lion and the Mouse

A Lion, tired with the chase, lay sleeping at full length under a shady
tree.  Some Mice, scrambling over him while he slept, awoke him.
Laying his paw upon one of them, he was about to crush him, but the
Mouse implored his mercy in such moving terms that he let him go.

Now it happened that sometime afterward the Lion was caught in a net
laid by some hunters, and, unable to free himself, made the forest
resound with his roars.  The Mouse, recognizing the voice of his
preserver, ran to the spot, and with his little sharp teeth gnawed the
ropes asunder and set the Lion free.



The Swallow and Other Birds

A Swallow, observing a Husbandman employed in sowing hemp, called the
little Birds together and informed them of what the farmer was about.
He told them that hemp was the material from which the nets, so fatal
to the feathered race, were composed; and advised them to join
unanimously in picking it up in order to prevent the consequences.

The Birds, either disbelieving his information or neglecting his
advice, gave themselves no trouble about the matter.  In a little time
the hemp appeared above the ground, when the friendly Swallow again
addressed himself to them, and told them it was not yet too late,
provided they would immediately set about the work, before the seeds
had taken too deep root.  But as they still rejected his advice, he
