  PETER PATTER _told them to me,
  All the little rimes,
  Whispered them among the bushes
  Half a hundred times.

  Peter lives upon a mountain
  Pretty near the sun,
  Knows the bears and birds and rabbits
  Nearly every one;
  Has a home among the alders,
  Bed of cedar bark,
  Walks alone beneath the pine trees
  Even when it's dark.

  Squirrels tell him everything
  That happens in the trees,
  Cricket in the gander-grass
  Sings of all he sees;
  Rimes from bats and butterflies,
  Crabs and waterfowl;
  But the best of all he gets
  From his Uncle Owl.

  Sometimes when its day-time,
  But mostly in the night,
  They sit beneath an oak tree
  And hug each other tight,
  And tell their rimes and riddles
  Where the catty creatures prowl--
  Funny little Peter Patter
  And his Uncle Owl._
