    _When last heard from, Captain Sheldon was preparing to return to
    Japan--on the not unreasonable claim that the Island Empire was the
    only place where he was able to write undisturbed. Considering this
    two-time Air Force officer's output, however--ranging from
    upper-bracket love and auto-racing tales to a brilliant new novel,
    TROUBLING OF A STAR, that has won major bookclub distribution, and
    including scores of fine science fiction stories--we wonder whether
    this peripatetic author may not be planning to flood all markets.
    Not a bad idea._

 One sure way to live dangerously is to become a practical joker.
 Should you have any doubts about it you might ask Professor Dane.


You didn't have to be a potential Einstein to take Professor Dane's
course. For one thing you got a few easy credits and for another you
were entertained--without letup--by Professor Lyman Dane's celebrated
wit.
