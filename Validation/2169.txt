PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

BY CHARLES FOLLEN.


This little book is dedicated to parents and children. Most of the
poems were written with no other hope, than that they would instruct
or please some child. The pleasure they have given in a limited circle
has tempted the writer to print them. Some have never before appeared
in public, but most of them have been already published in different
works; some few, without the author's knowledge.

It will be found that these poems are intended for children of
different ages and characters. It may be objected to the book, that
gay and serious pieces are bound up together; but so it is in human
life and human nature, and it is essential to the healthful action of
a child's mind that it should be so. The smile that overtakes its
tears is as necessary to the child as the sun after a spring shower
is to the young plant; and without it a blight will fall upon the
opening blossom.

The natural love that all have for their literary offspring, perhaps,
first induced the author to bring the stray little family together.
This motive was strengthened by the hope that children might love the
book, and that she might have the pleasure of seeing it among their
treasures, with the corners of the leaves well worn by their little
fingers, and perhaps sometimes placed upon the pillow where "angels
hover round."

This success, which must secure to her also the approbation of
parents, she does aspire after, and most earnestly desire; this, and
this alone, will satisfy her; without this, she would be the first to
pronounce it an unworthy offering.

PREFACE

TO THE PRESENT EDITION.


The present edition of Hymns, Songs, and Fables, has been greatly
enlarged, by poems either not before printed, or that have had a very
limited circulation, and also by a number of translations from the
German. If they should have the good fortune to add to the innocent
pleasure of the young, and deserve to become associated in their minds
with the pure and hallowed recollections of home, and happy early
days, my highest ambition with regard to them be entirely gratified.

HYMNS.


"SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN TO COME UNTO ME."

    "Let little children come to me,"--
      This is what the Saviour said;
    Little children, come and see
      Where these gracious words are read.

    Often on these pages look,--
      Of the love of God they tell;
    'Tis indeed a holy book,--
      Learn to read and love it well.

    Thus you hear the Saviour speak,--
      "Come ye all and learn of me";
    He was gentle, lowly, meek,--
      So should all his followers be.

    When our Saviour from above,
      From his Father did descend,
    He took them in his arms of love,
      And children knew him for their friend.

    All little children Jesus blessed,--
      Blessed in innocence they are;
    Little children he caressed;
      Praise him in your infant prayer.


HYMN.

    Praise to God! O let us raise
    From our hearts a song of praise!
    Of that goodness let us sing
    Whence our lives and blessings spring.

    Praise to him who made the light,
    Praise to him who gave us sight,
    Praise to him who formed the ear;
    Will he not his children hear?

    Praise him for our happy hours,
    Praise him for our varied powers,
    For these thoughts that rise above,
    For these hearts he made for love,

    For the voice he placed within,
    Bearing witness when we sin;
    Praise to him whose tender care
    Keeps this watchful guardian there.

    Praise his mercy, that did send
    Jesus for our guide and friend;
    Praise him, every heart and voice,
    Him who makes all worlds rejoice.


HYMN FOR A LITTLE BOY.

    "What, mother, makes it seem to me,
      When I am all alone,
    As if some one could hear and see,
      And all my thoughts were known?

    "Sometimes it makes me very glad,
      And dance and sing with joy;
    Sometimes it makes me very sad,
      And frights your little boy.

    "O, tell me, mother, tell me why;
      For I have never known
    Why 'tis I laugh, or why I cry,
      When I am all alone."

    "My child, you never are alone;
      There is a watchful eye
    To which your very thoughts are known;
      'Tis God is ever nigh.

    "He made your little heart for joy,
      He tunes your happy song;
    O, then, my little timid boy,
      Fear only doing wrong.

    "For he who makes your heart so glad,
      Who bids the good be gay,
    With the same love will make it sad,
      Whene'er you disobey.

    "He is our Father, and he hears
      Your weakest, faintest prayer;
    He wipes away an infant's tears,
      And children are his care."


"THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH."
