Naturally human work was more creative, more inspiring, more important
than robot drudgery. Naturally it was the most important task in all the
world ... or was it?




THE REAL HARD SELL

By William W. Stuart


Ben Tilman sat down in the easiest of all easy chairs. He picked up a
magazine, flipped pages; stood up, snapped fingers; walked to the view
wall, walked back; sat down, picked up the magazine.

He was waiting, near the end of the day, after hours, in the lush, plush
waiting room--"The customer's ease is the Sales Manager's please"--to
see the Old Man. He was fidgety, but not about something. About nothing.
He was irritated at nobody, at the world; at himself.

He was irritated at himself because there was no clear reason for him to
be irritated at anything.

There he sat, Ben Tilman, normally a cheerful, pleasant young man. He
was a salesman like any modern man and a far better salesman than most.
He had a sweet little wife, blonde and pretty. He had a fine, husky
two-year-old boy, smart, a real future National Sales Manager. He loved
them both. He had every reason to be contented with his highly
desirable, comfortable lot.

And yet he had been getting more sour and edgy ever since about six
months after the baby came home from the Center and the novelty of
responsibility for wife and child had worn off. He had now quit three
jobs, good enough sales jobs where he was doing well, in a year. For no
reason? For petty, pointless reasons.

With Ancestral Insurance, "Generations of Protection," he'd made the
Billion Dollar Club--and immediately begun to feel dissatisfied with
it--just before cute, sexy, blonde Betty had suddenly come from nowhere
into his life and he had married her. That had helped, sure. But as soon
after that as he had started paying serious attention to his job again,
he was fed up with it. "Too much paper work. All those forms. It's work
for a robot, not a man," he'd told Betty when he quit. A lie. The paper
work was, as he looked back on it, not bad at all; pleasant even, in a
way. It was just--nothing. Anything.

Indoor-Outdoor Climatizers--sniffles, he said, kept killing his sales
presentation even though his record was good enough. Ultra-sonic
toothbrushes, then, were a fine product. Only the vibration, with his
gold inlay, seemed to give him headaches after every demonstration. He
didn't _have_ a gold inlay. But the headaches were real enough. So he
quit.

So now he had a great new job with a great organization, Amalgamated
Production for Living--ALPRODLIV. He was about to take on his first big
assignment.

For that he had felt a spark of the old enthusiasm and it had carried
him into working out a bright new sales approach for the deal tonight.
The Old Man himself had taken a personal interest, which was a terrific
break. And still Ben Tilman felt that uneasy dissatisfaction. Damn.

"Mr. Robb will see you now, Mr. Tilman," said the cool robot voice from
the Elec-Sec Desk. It was after customer hours and the charming human
