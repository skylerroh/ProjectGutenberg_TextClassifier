taken up with Worldly Business, and Died before he had time to open the
Treasury of his Knowledge, so that most of those pieces of his which are
extant, are imperfect; particularly his Book _about the Soul_) and his
_Tedbiro 'lmotawahhid,_ i.e. _How a Man ought to manage himself that
leads a Solitary Life_ So are his _Logicks_ and _Physicks_. Those Pieces
of his which are compleat, are only short Tracts and some occasional
Letters. Nay, in his Epistle concerning the _UNION_, he himself
confesses that he had wrote nothing compleat, where he says, _That it
would require a great deal of trouble and pains to express that clearly
which he had undertaken to prove_; and, _that the method which he had
made use of in explaining himself, was not in many places so exact as it
might have been_; and, _that he design'd, if he had time, to alter it_.
So much for _Avenpace_, I for my part never saw him, and as for his
Contemporaries, they were far inferiour to him, nor did I ever see any
of their Works. Those who are now alive, are, either such as are still
advancing forwards, or else such as have left off, without attaining to
perfection; if there are any other, I know nothing of them.

As to those Works of _Alpharabius_ which are extant, they are most of
them _Logick_. There are a great many things very dubious in his
Philosophical Works; for in his _Mellatolphadelah_, i.e. _The most
excellent Sect_, he asserts expressly, _that the Souls of Wicked Men
shall suffer everlasting Punishment_; and yet says as positively in his
Politicks that they shall be dissolv'd and annihilated, and that the
Souls of the Perfect shall remain for ever. And then in his _Ethicks_,
speaking concerning the Happiness of Man, he says, _that it is only in
this Life_, and then adds, _that whatsoever People talk of besides, is
meer Whimsy and old Wives Fables_. A principle, which if believ'd would
make all Men despair of the Mercy of God, and puts the Good and Evil
both upon the same Level, in that it makes annihilation the common end
to them both. This is an Error not to be pardon'd by any means, or made
amends for. Besides all this, he had a mean Opinion of the Gift of
Prophecy, and said that in his Judgment it did belong to the _faculty of
Imagination_, and that he prefer'd Philosophy before it; with a great
many other things of the like nature, not necessary to be mention'd
here.

As for the Books of _Aristotle, Avicenna_'s Exposition of them in his
_Alshepha_ [i.e. _Health_] supplies their Room, for he trod in the same
steps and was of the same Sect. In the beginning of that Book, says,
that the _Truth_ was in his opinion different from what he had there
deliver'd, that he had written that Book according to the Philosophy of
the _Peripateticks_; but those that would know the _Truth_ clearly, and
without Obscurity, he refers to his Book, _Of the Eastern Philosophy_.
Now he that takes the pains to compare his _Alshepha_ with what
_Aristotle_ has written, will find they agree in most things, tho' in
the _Alshepha_ there are a great many things which are not extant in any
of those pieces which we have of _Aristotle_. But if the Reader, take
the literal Sense only, either of the _Alshepha_ or _Aristotle_, with,
out penetrating into the hidden Sense, he will never attain to
perfection, as _Avicenna_ himself observes in the _Alshepha_.

As for _Algazali_[14], he often contradicts himself, denying in one
place what he affirm'd in another. He taxes the Philosophers with
_Heresy_[15] in his Book which he calls _Altehaphol_, i.e.
_Destruction_, because they deny the Resurrection of the Body, and hold
that Rewards and Punishments in a Future State belong to the Soul only.
Then in the beginning of his _Almizan_, i.e. _The Balance_, he affirms
positively, that this is the Doctrine of the _Suphians_[16], and that he
was convinc'd of the truth of it, after a great deal of Study and
Search. There are a great many such Contradictions as these interspers'd
in his Works; which he himself begs Pardon for in the end of his _Mizan
Alamal [The Ballance of Mens Actions]_; where he says, that there are
Three sorts of Opinions; 1. Such as are common to the Vulgar, and
agreeable to their Notions of things. 2. Such as we commonly make use of
in answering Questions propos'd to us. 3. Such private as a Man has to
himself, which none understand but those who think just as he does. And
then he adds, that tho' there were no more in what he had written than
only this, _viz_. That it made a Man doubt of those things which he had
imbib'd at first, and help'd him to remove the prejudices of Education,
that even that were sufficient; because, he that never doubts will never
weigh things aright, and he that does not do that will never see, hut
remain in Blindness and Confusion.

     _Believe your Eyes, but still suspect your Ears,_
     _You'll need no Star-light[17], when the day appears_.

This is the account of his way of Philosophizing, the greatest part of
which is enigmatical and full of obscurity, and for that reason of no
use to any but such as thoroughly perceive and understand the matter
before, and then afterwards hear it from him again, or at least such as
are of an excellent Capacity, and can apprehend a thing from the least
intimation. The same Author says in his _Aljawahir_ [i.e. _The Jewels_]
that he had Books not fit to be communicated, but to such only as were
qualified to read them, and that in them he had laid down the _Naked
Truth_; but none of them ever came into _Spain_ that we know of: we have
indeed had Books which some have imagin'd to be those incommunicable
ones he speaks of, but 'tis a mistake, for those are _Almaareph
Alakliyah [Intellectual notices]_ and the _Alnaphchi walteswiyal
[Inflation and AEquation]_ and besides these, _a Collection of several
Questions_. But as for these, tho' there are some hints in them, yet
they contain nothing of particular use to the clearing of things, but
what you may meet with in his other Books. There are, 'tis true, in his
_Almeksad Alasna_, some things which are more profound than what we meet
with in the rest of his Books, but he expressly says, that that Book is
not _incommunicable_; from whence it follows, those Books which are come
to our hands are not those incommunicable ones which he means. Some have
fancy'd that there were some great matters contain'd in that Discourse
of his, which is at the end of his _Meschal_ [i.e. _Casement_] (which
Belief of theirs, has plung'd them into inextricable Difficulties) where
speaking of the several sorts of those who are kept from nearer
Approaches, by the Brightness of the radiation of the Divine light, and
then of those who had attain'd to the _UNION_, he says of these later,
_That they apprehended such Attributes to belong to the Divine Essence
as were destructive of its Unity_; from, whence it appear'd to them that
he believ'd a sort of Multiplicity in the Godhead, which is horrid
Blasphemy. Now I make no Question but that the worthy Doctor _Algazali_
was one of those which attain'd to the utmost degree of Happiness, and
to those heights which are proper _to_ those who enjoy the _UNION_; but
as for his secret or incommunicable Books, which contain the manner of
_Revelation_, they never came to my hands: and that pitch of knowledge
which I have attain'd to, is owing to his other works and to _Avicenna_,
which I read and compar'd with the Opinions of the present Philosophers,
till at length I came to the Knowledge of the Truth. At first indeed, by
way of Enquiry and Contemplation;but afterwards I came to have a perfect
sense, and then I found that I could say something which I could call my
own. Now I was resolv'd that you should be the first, to whom I would
Communicate what I knew about these matters, both upon the account of
the Intimacy of our Friendship, and your Candor and Integrity. Only
observe, that my discovering to you the Ends which I attain'd in this
way, without proving the Principles to you first, by which those Ends
are attain'd, will do you no more Service, than any other Story which
you receive by tradition, or any thing told you in general, of which you
don't know how to make a particular application. Presuming that you will
accept it kindly, not for any merit of the Author, but upon the account
of our Friendship and Acquaintance; and I heartily desire that you
mayn't stop here, but aspire to a loftier degree: for this is so far
from being able to bring you to those heights, that is not sufficient to
save you. Now I would lead you by the same paths which I have walk'd in
before you, and make you steer by the same Compass, till you arrive at
the same Point, and see with your own Eyes what I have seen before you,
so as not to take it on trust any longer from me, but to experience it
yourself. But this is a matter which will not only require considerable
Time, but also that you are free and disingag'd from all manner of
Business, and follow it close with great Application. And if you are
really in earned, and set about it heartily, you will rejoyce as one
that has Travelled all Night do's when the Sun rises upon him, and will
receive a Blessing for your Labour, and take delight in your Lord, and
he will delight in you. And for my own part, you will find me, according
to your own Hearts desire, just such an one as you could wish; and I
hope that I shall lead you in the right way, free from Evils and
Dangers: and really I perceive some Glimmerings now, by the help of
which I shall inflame your Desire, and put you upon entring this way, by
telling you the Story of _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_ and _Asal_, and _Salaman_ (as
_Avicenna_ calls them); in which, those that understand themselves right
will find matter of Improvement, and worthy their Imitation.

[Footnote 8: Abu Hamed Algazali--_What_ Abu Hamed Algazali _thought
concerning those Men who were so wild and Enthusiastick as to
use such extravagant expressions, appears plainly from those words

"People ran on to such a degree, (_of madness you may
be sure_) as to pretend to an Union with God, and a fight
of him without the interposition of any Veil, and familiarly
discourse with him. _And a little after_, which sort
of Speeches have occasion'd great mischiefs among the
common People; so that some Country Fellows laying aside
their Husbandry, have pretended to the same things:
for Men are naturally pleas'd with such discourses, as
give them a liberty to neglect their business, and withal
promise them purity of Mind, and the attainment of
strange degrees and proprieties. Now the most stupid
Wretches in Nature may pretend to this, and have in
their Mouths such false and deceitful expressions. And
if any one denies what they say, they immediately tell
you, that this Unbelief of yours proceeds from _Learning_
and _Logick_: and that _Learning_ is a _Veil_, and _Logick_
labour of the brain, but that these things which they
affirm, are discovered only inwardly then by the
_Light of the TRUTH_. And this which they affirm, has spread
_it self_ through a great many Countries, and produc'd a
great deal of Mischief." _Thus far_ Algazali. _How exactly
this answers the wild extravagancies of our Enthusiasts, let
themselves judge. And withal I would have them from hence
learn the Modesty not to pretend to be the first after the Apostles
who had endeavour'd to turn Men from Darkness to LIGHT,
since they see so many worthy Persons among the Mahometans
gone before them_.]

that it seems something odd, that he should mention that Sect first,

had not been for the word_ Asshariyato, _which, if I mistake not,

or Law of God, I should have understood those Words of the
Sect of_ Mahomet Ebn Edris Asshaphiensis. _See Dr._ Pocock _'s

Suphian. _It seems not to be known
among them till about the_ 200 _Year of the_ Hegira. _The most probable
Interpretation of it is from the Arabick word_ Suph, _which
signifies_ Wool, _because those that followed this Sect refused to
wear Silk, and Cloathed themselves only with_ Wool. Dr. Pocock
_and_ Golius _follow this Interpretation; tho' the latter in his
Lexicon seems to doubt whether it is deriv'd from the [Greek: sophos]

THE HISTORY OF _HAI EBN YOKDHAN_.


Sec. 1. Our Ancestors, of Happy Memory, tell us, that there is an Island in
the _Indian_ Ocean, situate under the Equinoctial, where Men come into
the world spontaneously without the help of Father and Mother. This
Island it seems, is blest with such a due Influence of the Sun, as to be
the most temperate and perfect of all places in the Creation; tho' it
must be confess'd that such an Assertion is contrary to the Opinion of
the most celebrated Philosophers and Physicians, who affirm that the
fourth Climate is the most Temperate. Now if the reason which they give
for this Assertion, viz. _That these parts situate under the Equinoctial
are not habitable_; were drawn, from any Impediment from the Earth, 'tis
allow'd that it would appear more probable; but if the reason be,
because of the intense Heat (which is that which most of 'em assign)
'tis absolutely false, and the contrary is prov'd by undeniable
demonstration. For 'tis demonstrated in Natural Philosophy, that there
is no other cause of Heat than Motion, or else the Contact and Light of
Hot Bodies. 'Tis also prov'd that the Sun, in it self, is not hot, nor
partakes of any mix'd Quality: 'tis prov'd moreover, that the thickest
and smoothest Bodies receive Light in the greatest degree of perfection;
and next to them, the thicker which are not smooth, and those which are
very thin receive no Light at all. (This was first demonstrated by
_Avicenna_, never mention'd before by any of the Ancients.) From these
Premises, this Consequence will necessarily follow, _viz_. That the Sun
do's not Communicate his Heat to the Earth, after the same manner as hot
Bodies heat those other Bodies which are near them because the Sun is
not hot in it self. Nor can it be said that the Earth is heated by
Motion, because it stands still, and remains in the same posture, both
when the Sun shines upon it, and when it does not, and yet 'tis evident
to Sense, that there is a vast difference in it, in respect of Heat and
Cold, at those several times. Nor does the Sun first heat the Air, and
so the Earth; because we may observe in hot weather, that the Air which
is nearest the Earth, is hotter by much than that which is higher and
more remote. It remains therefore that the Sun has no other way of
heating the Earth but by its Light, for Heat always follows Light, so
that when its Beams are collected, as in Burning-Glasses for instance,
it fires all before it. Now 'tis Demonstrated in Mathematicks, that the
Sun is a Spherical Body, and so is the Earth; and that the Sun is much
greater than the Earth; and that part of the Earth which is at all times
illuminated by the Sun is above half of it; and that in that half which
is illuminated, the Light is most intense in the midst; both because
that part is the most remote from Darkness, which is the Circumference
of the Circle, as also, because it lies opposite to more parts of the
Sun: and that those parts which are nearest the Circumference of the
Circle, have less Light; and so gradually, till the Circumference of the
Circle, which encompasses the illuminated part of the Earth, ends in
Darkness.

Sec. 2. Now that is the Center of the Circle of Light, where the Sun is
Vertical to the Inhabitants, and then in that place, the Heat is most
extreamly intense; and so those Countries are the coldest, where the Sun
is farthest from being Vertical. And if there were any such place where
the Sun was always Vertical, it must needs be extream hot. Now 'tis
demonstrated in Astronomy, that the Sun is Vertical twice a Year only,
to those which live under the Equinoctial, _viz_. when he enters into
_Aries_ and _Libra_; and all the rest of the Year he declines from them,
six months Northward, and six months Southward; and for that reason they
are neither too hot nor too cold, but of a Moderate Temper between both.
There's much more to be said about this Argument, in order to the
explaining it fully, but it is not suitable to our purpose; I have only
hinted it to you, because it helps the Story a little, and makes it
something more probable that a Man may be form'd without the help of
Father and Mother; and there are some which affirm positively that _Hai
Ebn Yokdhan_ was so, others deny it, and tell the Story thus:

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration 3]

       *       *       *       *       *

Sec. 3. They say, that there lay, not far from this our Island, another
Great Island very fertile and well peopled; which was then govern'd by a
Prince of a Proud and Jealous Disposition: he had a Sister of exquisite
Beauty, which he confin'd and restrain'd from Marriage, because he could
not match her to one suitable to her quality He had a near Relation
whose Name was _Yokdhan_, that courted this Princess, and Married her
privately, according to the Rites of Matrimony then in use among them;
it was not long before she prov'd with Child, and was brought to Bed of
a Son; and being afraid that it should be discovered, she took him in
the Evening, and when she had Suckled him she put him into a little Ark
which she closed up fast, and so Conveys him to the Sea shore, with some
of her Servants and Friends as she could trust; and there with an Heart
equally affected with Love and Fear, she takes her last leave of him in
