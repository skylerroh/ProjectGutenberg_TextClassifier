VALLEY OF DREAMS


Captain Harrison of the _Ares_ expedition turned away from the little
telescope in the bow of the rocket. "Two weeks more, at the most," he
remarked. "Mars only retrogrades for seventy days in all, relative to
the earth, and we've got to be homeward bound during that period, or
wait a year and a half for old Mother Earth to go around the sun and
catch up with us again. How'd you like to spend a winter here?"

Dick Jarvis, chemist of the party, shivered as he looked up from his
notebook. "I'd just as soon spend it in a liquid air tank!" he averred.
"These eighty-below zero summer nights are plenty for me."

"Well," mused the captain, "the first successful Martian expedition
ought to be home long before then."

"Successful if we get home," corrected Jarvis. "I don't trust these
cranky rockets--not since the auxiliary dumped me in the middle of Thyle
last week. Walking back from a rocket ride is a new sensation to me."

"Which reminds me," returned Harrison, "that we've got to recover your
films. They're important if we're to pull this trip out of the red.
Remember how the public mobbed the first moon pictures? Our shots ought
to pack 'em to the doors. And the broadcast rights, too; we might show a
profit for the Academy."

"What interests me," countered Jarvis, "is a personal profit. A book,
for instance; exploration books are always popular. _Martian
Deserts_--how's that for a title?"

"Lousy!" grunted the captain. "Sounds like a cook-book for desserts.
You'd have to call it 'Love Life of a Martian,' or something like that."

Jarvis chuckled. "Anyway," he said, "if we once get back home, I'm going
to grab what profit there is, and never, never, get any farther from the
earth than a good stratosphere plane'll take me. I've learned to
appreciate the planet after plowing over this dried-up pill we're on
now."

"I'll lay you odds you'll be back here year after next," grinned the
Captain. "You'll want to visit your pal--that trick ostrich."

"Tweel?" The other's tone sobered. "I wish I hadn't lost him, at that.
He was a good scout. I'd never have survived the dream-beast but for
him. And that battle with the push-cart things--I never even had a
chance to thank him."

"A pair of lunatics, you two," observed Harrison. He squinted through
the port at the gray gloom of the Mare Cimmerium. "There comes the sun."
He paused. "Listen, Dick--you and Leroy take the other auxiliary rocket
and go out and salvage those films."

Jarvis stared. "Me and Leroy?" he echoed ungrammatically. "Why not me
and Putz? An engineer would have some chance of getting us there and
back if the rocket goes bad on us."

The captain nodded toward the stern, whence issued at that moment a
medley of blows and guttural expletives. "Putz is going over the insides
of the _Ares_," he announced. "He'll have his hands full until we leave,
because I want every bolt inspected. It's too late for repairs once we
cast off."

"And if Leroy and I crack up? That's our last auxiliary."

"Pick up another ostrich and walk back," suggested Harrison gruffly.
Then he smiled. "If you have trouble, we'll hunt you out in the _Ares_,"
he finished. "Those films are important." He turned. "Leroy!"

The dapper little biologist appeared, his face questioning.

"You and Jarvis are off to salvage the auxiliary," the Captain said.
"Everything's ready and you'd better start now. Call back at half-hour
intervals; I'll be listening."

Leroy's eyes glistened. "Perhaps we land for specimens--no?" he queried.

"Land if you want to. This golf ball seems safe enough."

"Except for the dream-beast," muttered Jarvis with a faint shudder. He
frowned suddenly. "Say, as long as we're going that way, suppose I have
a look for Tweel's home! He must live off there somewhere, and he's the
most important thing we've seen on Mars."

Harrison hesitated. "If I thought you could keep out of trouble," he
muttered. "All right," he decided. "Have a look. There's food and water
aboard the auxiliary; you can take a couple of days. But keep in touch
with me, you saps!"

Jarvis and Leroy went through the airlock out to the grey plain. The
thin air, still scarcely warmed by the rising sun, bit flesh and lung
like needles, and they gasped with a sense of suffocation. They dropped
to a sitting posture, waiting for their bodies, trained by months in
acclimatization chambers back on earth, to accommodate themselves to the
tenuous air. Leroy's face, as always, turned a smothered blue, and
Jarvis heard his own breath rasping and rattling in his throat. But in
five minutes, the discomfort passed; they rose and entered the little
auxiliary rocket that rested beside the black hull of the _Ares_.
