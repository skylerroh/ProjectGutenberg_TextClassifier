The wheels of the steamer turned rapidly for a moment, and the
_Woodville_ slid off the ground into deep water.

"Hurrah!" shouted Lawry, as he rang the bell to stop her. "She's all
right now," he added, through the tube.

"Go ahead, then," replied the engineer.

"As soon as I make fast the wherry astern."

Before he went to the wheel-house he sounded the pumps again, and
visited the forehold to examine the oilcloth over the aperture in the
bow. There was but little water in the well, and the canvas carpet
was faithful to its duty. There was nothing to fear, though Lawry
couldn't help fearing.

"Are you all ready, Ethan?" called the pilot through the tube.

"All ready; but don't you think we had better hoist the flags, and
go over in good style?" responded the engineer.

"Aye, aye."

The small American flag and the union jack, which had been taken
from the poles the night before, and deposited in the locker of the
wherry, were displayed, and Lawry returned to his post.

The pilot rang his bell to start, and the wheels turned slowly as
Ethan opened the valve. The _Woodville_ moved off from the
shore, and Lawry's heart bounded as though it had been part of the
engine. He grasped the spokes, and heaved the wheel over; the
beautiful craft obeyed her helm.

"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!" shouted Lawry, at the mouth of the
speaking-tube.

"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!" echoed back from the engine-room.

Lawry stood at the wheel, looking through the open window in front
of him. It was his hour of triumph. As he gazed at the shore, he saw
the ferry-boat start out from the landing. There was no vehicle in
her, and as the steamer approached nearer to her, he saw that Mr.
Sherwood and the ladies were on board of her. They were coming out to
welcome and congratulate Ethan and himself upon the triumphant
success of the enterprise. Mrs. Wilford was with them, and Ben held
the steering oar.

Lawry informed his friend, through the tube, of the approach of the
party. The ladies in the ferry-boat were waving their handkerchiefs,
and Mr. Sherwood was swinging his hat.

"Whistle, Lawry!" shouted the engineer, as the pilot informed him
what was taking place.

"Hurrah!" shouted the pilot, as he pulled the string.

As the _Woodville_ came up to the bateau, Lawry rang to stop,
and, swinging his hat out the window, gave three cheers all alone,
while the ladies waved their handkerchiefs in reply.




CHAPTER XIV

CAPTAIN LAWRY


The bateau ran up to the steamer, and Ben made her fast at the
forward gangway. Mr. Sherwood still cheered, and the ladies continued
to wave their handkerchiefs.

"Won't you come on board?" said Lawry to the party.

"I shall, for one," replied Mr. Sherwood.

"I'm afraid of her," added Miss Fanny.

"There is nothing to fear, ladies. She is safe, and we are running
her very slowly," continued the young pilot.

"Lawry knows where the rocks are," said Mrs. Wilford, "and I'll
warrant you there is no danger."

With some misgivings, the ladies, who had suffered by the
catastrophe when the _Woodville_ was wrecked, permitted themselves
to be handed to the deck of the steamer.

"I congratulate you on your success, Lawry," said Mr. Sherwood, as
he stepped on board after the ladies. "You have worked bravely, and
succeeded nobly;" and he grasped the hand of the pilot.

"Thank you, sir. I knew I could raise her, if I had fair play. I
don't know but you are sick of your bargain, sir, in giving her to me."

"By no means, Captain Lawry," replied the rich man, laughing. "If
the ladies succeed in overcoming their terror of steamboats, I
suppose I can charter the boat for our party when we wish to use her."

"She's at your service always, sir," replied Lawry.

"Oh, I shall take her on the same terms that others do. When I use
her, I shall pay you."

"That wouldn't be fair, sir. I couldn't take any money from you for
the use of her," added Lawry, blushing.

"We will not talk about that now. When she is in condition for use,
we will consider these questions. How did you find her this morning?"
asked Mr. Sherwood, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye.

"We found the water all pumped out of her; and we didn't know what
to make of it," answered Lawry.

All the visitors burst out laughing, and heartily enjoyed the
astonishment and confusion of the young pilot.

"I don't understand it," exclaimed Lawry.

"The fairies, knowing what a good boy you are, Lawry, must have
pumped her out for you," said Miss Fanny.

"Perhaps they did."

Mr. Sherwood then explained what he had done the preceding night,
and the reason why he had done it. Ben Wilford, after fastening the
ferry-boat at the stern of the steamer, had come on deck, and
listened to the explanation. He saw in what manner his malice had
been defeated, and he looked very much dissatisfied with himself and
everybody on board.

"You were very kind, Mr. Sherwood, to take so much trouble upon
yourself," said Lawry.

"It was no trouble at all; it was a great pleasure to me. But I
don't understand how the steamer happened to be on the other side of
the lake."

"I supposed the persons who bailed her out set her adrift. The casks
were all knocked out from under the guards, and they are scattered
all along the shore."

"Before my men left her last night, I went all over the boat to
satisfy myself that everything was right. I examined the cables very
carefully, and I am sure they were well stoppered at twelve o'clock,
when we went on shore."

"I fastened the cable myself, and I don't think she could have
broken loose herself."

Ben Wilford listened in sullen silence to this conversation, and his
mother could hardly keep from crying as she thought of the guilt of
her oldest son. She was not willing to tell Lawry what his brother
had done, fearful that his indignation would produce a quarrel where
brotherly love should prevail. She believed that Ben had attempted,
while under the influence of liquor, to sink the _Woodville_,
and that he would not do such a thing in his sober senses.

Neither Lawry nor Mr. Sherwood could explain in what manner the
steamer had broken from her moorings and the oil-casks been removed
from their fastenings; so they were obliged to drop the matter,
congratulating themselves upon the present safety of the boat.

"We will go ashore with you, Captain Lawry, when you are ready,"
said Mr. Sherwood, after the question had been disposed of in this
unsatisfactory manner.

"Captain Lawry!" sneered Ben.

"Certainly; he is the captain of the steamer--isn't he?" laughed Mr.
Sherwood.

"It sounds big for a boy," growled Ben.

"He will make a good captain."

Ben turned and walked away, disgusted with the idea.

"I'm ready, sir," said Lawry.

"Where are you bound next, Captain Lawry?" asked Mr. Sherwood.

"I'm going to fish up the anchors we lost, and then to pick up the
oil-casks," replied Lawry.

"Where do you intend to keep your steamer?"

"I hadn't thought of that, sir."

"You will need a wharf."

"We need one; but I think we shall have to get along without one."

"Where would be a good place to have one?"

"The deepest water is just below the ferry-landing. We could get
depth enough for this boat by running a pier out about forty feet.
Ethan and I can build some kind of a wharf, when we have time."

Mr. Sherwood said no more about the matter, and Ben landed the
visitors in the ferry-boat. The _Woodville_ then ran down to the
Goblins, and towed the raft out to the spot where the anchors lay. A
boat grapnel was dragged over the spot, the cables hooked, and the
anchors hauled up with the derrick on the raft, from which they were
transferred to the steamer.

Having obtained these necessary appendages of the steamer, they
returned to the landing for the ferry-boat, in which they intended to
load the oil-casks, and convey them to Pointville. Ben was at the
landing when she arrived, and without any invitation, stepped on
board the ferry-boat, and thence to the steamer.

"Don't you want some help, Lawry?" asked Ben.

"Yes; we should be glad of all the help we can get," replied Lawry
pleasantly.

"Well, I'll help you."

"We have a good deal of hard work to do to-day," added the pilot. "I
would like to get the boat on the ways at Port Henry to-night."

"That can be done easy enough."

Ben Wilford seemed now to have adopted a conciliatory policy, but it
was evidently done for a purpose. When the _Woodville_ reached
the Goblins, he worked with good will in loading the ferry-boat,
which was towed over to Pointville, and her cargo discharged. The
casks, which had drifted over to the eastern shore of the lake, were
then picked up, and landed at the same place. The man who had carted
them down to the shore was engaged to convey them back to the barn of
the oil speculator. It was noon by the time this work was all
accomplished; and the _Woodville_ again crossed the lake, and
came to anchor in the deep water above the ferry-landing, as close to
the shore as it was prudent for her to lie. Ethan banked his fires,
and the boys went on shore to dinner, one at a time; for after the
experience of the preceding night they would not leave the steamer
alone for a single moment.

After dinner, Mr. Sherwood, who appeared to be as much interested in
the little steamer as though she had not changed her ownership, came
on board again, accompanied by the ladies. It had before been decided
that the carpets should be taken up, the muslin curtains removed, and
such portions of the furniture and utensils as had been injured by
the water should be conveyed on shore to be cleaned, and put in
proper order for use. In this labor Mr. Sherwood's party and Mrs.
Wilford assisted, and by the middle of the afternoon everything had
been removed. Ben Wilford aided very zealously, and his mother
hopefully concluded that he was sorry for what he intended to do, and
wished to remove any suspicion of evil intentions on his part.

The _Woodville_ was now going down to Port Henry, where the
repairs on her hull were to be made, and the pilot and engineer were
to remain on board. Ben promised faithfully to run the ferry during
Lawry's absence; and, cheered by the party on the shore, the
_Woodville_ departed for her destination. She ran at half speed,
but reached the port before sunset. The next morning she went on the
ways, and her repairs commenced. During that time Ethan was
constantly employed on the engine, and when the steamer was restored
to her native element there was not a suspicion of rust on the
machinery.

Lawry was also as busy as a bee all the time, scrubbing the floors,
cleaning the paint, and polishing the brass-work. When the boat was
ready to return to Port Rock, she was in condition to receive her
furniture. She was launched early in the morning, and Ethan proceeded
at once to get up steam. Both of the boys were in the highest state
of expectancy and delight; and when Lawry struck the bell to start
her, he was hardly less excited than when he had done so for the
first time after the water had been pumped out of her. All the
bunting was displayed at the bow and stern, and the _Woodville_
now plowed the lake at full speed. Her happy owner realized that she
was good for ten miles an hour, which, for so diminutive a craft, was
more than he had a right to expect.

"Hello!" shouted Lawry to himself, as the steamer approached the
ferry-landing; "what's that?"

In the deep water which the young pilot had indicated as the best
place for a wharf, a pier was in process of erection. A score of
bridge-builders were sawing, hammering, and chopping, and Mr.
Sherwood stood in their midst, watching their operations. The
structure was not complete, but the mooring posts were set up, so
that the _Woodville_ could be made fast to them. Mr. Sherwood
and the workmen gave three cheers as the steamer approached.

"Run her up here, Lawry!" shouted his wealthy friend. "Aye, aye, sir."

"You have taken this job out of my hands, sir," said Lawry, as he
glanced at the wharf.

"Yes; I thought I could do it better than you could, as your time
will be fully occupied."

"I think I should have found time enough to do what I intended; but
of course I couldn't have built any such wharf as this."

"It is none too good."

"But I ought to pay for it out of the money I may earn with the boat."

"Never mind that, Lawry," added Mr. Sherwood.

The young captain explained what had been done during his absence,
and informed his interested friend that the steamer was in condition
to receive her furniture.

"Shall you have her ready for a trip by to-morrow?" asked Mr.
Sherwood.

"Yes, sir."

"Because I have taken the liberty to engage her, in your name, for
several parties."

"You are very kind, sir," replied Lawry.

"Have you fixed upon any price for her?"

"Ethan and I were talking over the matter. We shall need some help
on board, and that will cost money. Coal is pretty high up here on
the lake."

"Well, how much did you intend to charge for her by the day, or the
hour?"

"We thought about three dollars an hour," replied Lawry, with much
diffidence.

"Three dollars an hour! You are too modest by half," laughed Mr.
Sherwood. "Make it five, at least. I told the parties I engaged for
you that the price would not be less than fifty dollars a day."

"I'm afraid I shall make money too fast at that rate," added Lawry.

"No, you won't. It will cost a great deal of money to run the boat.
What do you pay your engineer?"

"I don't know, sir; we have made no bargain yet."

"If Ethan does a man's work, you must pay him a man's wages. I
suppose he wants to make his fortune."

"What do you think he ought to have?" asked Lawry.

"Three dollars a day," replied Mr. Sherwood promptly. "I dare say
Ethan would not charge you half so much; but that is about the wages
of a man for running an engine in these times."

"I am satisfied, if that is fair wages; though it is a great deal
more than I ever made."

"Engineers get high wages. Then you want a fireman."
