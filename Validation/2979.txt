an inferior satellite; without France she is--nothing. Add to all this
a court more brilliant than that of Louis XIV., a sovereign not
indeed without faults and errors, but singularly mild in his nature,
warm-hearted to friends, forgiving to foes, whom personally no one could
familiarly know and not be charmed with a bonte of character, lovable as
that of Henri IV.,--and tell me what more than all this could you expect
from the reign of a Bourbon?"

"With such results," said Alain, "from the monarchy you so eloquently
praise, I fail to discover what the emperor's throne could possibly gain
by a few powerless converts from an unpopular, and you say, no doubt
truly, from a hopeless cause."

"I say monarchy gains much by the loyal adhesion of any man of courage,
ability, and honour. Every new monarchy gains much by conversions from
the ranks by which the older monarchies were strengthened and adorned.
But I do not here invoke your aid merely to this monarchy, my cousin;
I demand your devotion to the interests of France; I demand that you
should not rest an outlaw from her service. Ah, you think that France is
in no danger, that you may desert or oppose the Empire as you list, and
that society will remain safe! You are mistaken. Ask Enguerrand."

"Madame," said Enguerrand, "you overrate my political knowledge in that
appeal; but, honestly speaking, I subscribe to your reasonings. I agree
with you that the empire sorely needs the support of men of honour; it
has one cause of rot which now undermines it,--dishonest jobbery in its
administrative departments; even in that of the army, which apparently
is so heeded and cared for. I agree with you that France is in danger,
and may need the swords of all her better sons, whether against the
foreigner or against her worst enemies,--the mobs of her great towns.
I myself received a military education, and but for my reluctance to
separate myself from my father and Raoul, I should be a candidate for
employments more congenial to me than those of the Bourse and my trade
in the glove-shop. But Alain is happily free from all family ties, and
Alain knows that my advice to him is not hostile to your exhortations."

"I am glad to think he is under so salutary an influence," said the
Duchesse; and seeing that Alain remained silent and thoughtful, she
wisely changed the subject, and shortly afterwards the two friends took
leave.




CHAPTER IV.

Three days elapsed before Graham again saw M. Lebeau. The letter-writer
did not show himself at the cafe, and was not to be found at his office,
the ordinary business of which was transacted by his clerk, saying that
his master was much engaged on important matters that took him from
home.

Graham naturally thought that these matters concerned the discovery
of Louise Duval, and was reconciled to suspense. At the cafe, awaiting
Lebeau, he had slid into some acquaintance with the ouvrier Armand
Monnier, whose face and talk had before excited his interest. Indeed,
the acquaintance had been commenced by the ouvrier, who seated himself
at a table near to Graham's, and, after looking at him earnestly for
some minutes, said, "You are waiting for your antagonist at dominos, M.
Lebeau,--a very remarkable man."

"So he seems. I know, however, but little of him. You, perhaps, have
known him longer?"

"Several months. Many of your countrymen frequent this cafe, but you do
not seem to care to associate with the blouses."

"It is not that; but we islanders are shy, and don't make acquaintance
with each other readily. By the way, since you so courteously accost me,
I may take the liberty of saying that I overheard you defend the other
night, against one of my countrymen, who seemed to me to talk great
nonsense, the existence of le bon Dieu. You had much the best of it. I
rather gathered from your argument that you went somewhat further, and
were not too enlightened to admit of Christianity."

Armand Monnier looked pleased. He liked praise; and he liked to hear
himself talk, and he plunged at once into a very complicated sort of
Christianity,--partly Arian, partly Saint Simonian, with a little of
Rousseau and a great deal of Armand Monnier. Into this we need not
follow him; but, in sum, it was a sort of Christianity, the main heads
of which consisted in the removal of your neighbour's landmarks, in the
right of the poor to appropriate the property of the rich, in the right
of love to dispense with marriage, and the duty of the State to provide
for any children that might result from such union,--the parents being
incapacitated to do so, as whatever they might leave was due to the
treasury in common. Graham listened to these doctrines with melancholy
not unmixed with contempt. "Are these opinions of yours," he asked,
"derived from reading or your own reflection?"

"Well, from both, but from circumstances in life that induced me to
read and reflect. I am one of the many victims of the tyrannical law of
marriage. When very young I married a woman who made me miserable, and
then forsook me. Morally, she has ceased to be my wife; legally, she is.
I then met with another woman who suits me, who loves me. She lives with
me; I cannot marry her; she has to submit to humiliations, to be called
contemptuously an ouvrier's mistress. Then, though before I was only a
Republican, I felt there was something wrong in society which needed
a greater change than that of a merely political government; and then,
too, when I was all troubled and sore, I chanced to read one of Madame
de Grantmesnil's books. A glorious genius that woman's!"

"She has genius, certainly," said Graham, with a keen pang at his
heart,--Madame de Grantmesnil, the dearest friend of Isaura! "But," he
added, "though I believe that eloquent author has indirectly assailed
certain social institutions, including that of marriage, I am perfectly
persuaded that she never designed to effect such complete overthrow
of the system which all civilized communities have hitherto held in
reverence as your doctrines would attempt; and, after all, she but
expresses her ideas through the medium of fabulous incidents and
characters. And men of your sense should not look for a creed in the
fictions of poets and romance-writers."

"Ah," said Monnier, "I dare say neither Madame de Grantmesnil nor even
Rousseau ever even guessed the ideas they awoke in their readers; but
one idea leads on to another. And genuine poetry and romance touch
the heart so much more than dry treatises. In a word, Madame de
Grantmesnil's book set me thinking; and then I read other books, and
talked with clever men, and educated myself. And so I became the man I
am." Here, with a self-satisfied air, Monnier bowed to the Englishman,
and joined a group at the other end of the room.

The next evening, just before dusk, Graham Vane was seated musingly in
his own apartment in the Faubourg Montmartre, when there came a slight
knock at his door. He was so wrapped in thought that he did not hear
the sound, though twice repeated. The door opened gently, and M. Lebeau
appeared on the threshold. The room was lighted only by the gas-lamp
from the street without.

Lebeau advanced through the gloom, and quietly seated himself in the
corner of the fireplace opposite to Graham before he spoke. "A thousand
pardons for disturbing your slumbers, Monsieur Lamb."

Startled then by the voice so near him, Graham raised his head, looked
round, and beheld very indistinctly the person seated so near him.

"Monsieur Lebeau?"

"At your service. I promise to give an answer to your question; accept
my apologies that it has been deferred so long. I shall not this evening
go to our cafe. I took the liberty of calling--"

"Monsieur Lebeau, you are a brick."

"A what, Monsieur!--a brique?"

"I forgot; you are not up to our fashionable London idioms. A brick
means a jolly fellow, and it is very kind in you to call. What is your
decision?"

"Monsieur, I can give you some information, but it is so slight that
I offer it gratis, and forego all thought of undertaking further
inquiries. They could only be prosecuted in another country, and it
would not be worth my while to leave Paris on the chance of gaining so
trifling a reward as you propose. Judge for yourself. In the year 1849,
and in the month of July, Louise Duval left Paris for Aix-la-Chapelle.
There she remained some weeks, and then left it. I can learn no further
traces of her movements."

"Aix-la-Chapelle! What could she do there?"

"It is a Spa in great request; crowded during the summer season with
visitors from all countries. She might have gone there for health or for
pleasure."

"Do you think that one could learn more at the Spa itself if one went
there?"

"Possibly. But it is so long,--twenty years ago."

"She might have revisited the place."

"Certainly; but I know no more."

"Was she there under the same name,--Duval?"

"I am sure of that."

"Do you think she left it alone or with others? You tell me she was
awfully belle; she might have attracted admirers."

"If," answered Lebeau, reluctantly, "I could believe the report of my
informant, Louise Duval left Aix not alone, but with some gallant; not
an Englishman. They are said to have parted soon, and the man is now
dead. But, speaking frankly, I do not think Mademoiselle Duval would
have thus compromised her honour and sacrificed her future. I believe
she would have scorned all proposals that were not those of marriage.
But all I can say for certainty is that nothing is known to me of her
fate since she quitted Aix-la-Chapelle."

"In 1849? She had then a child living."

"A child? I never heard that she had any child; and I do not believe she
could have had any child in 1849."

Graham mused. Somewhat less than five years after 1849 Louise Duval had
been seen at Aix-la-Chapelle. Possibly she found some attraction at
that place, and might yet be discovered there. "Monsieur Lebeau," said
Graham, "you know this lady by sight; you would recognize her in spite
of the lapse of years. Will you go to Aix and find out there what you
can? Of course, expenses will be paid, and the reward will be given if
you succeed."

"I cannot oblige you. My interest in this poor lady is not very strong,
though I should be willing to serve her, and glad to know that she were
alive. I have now business on hand which interests me much more, and
which will take me from Paris, but not in the direction of Aix."

"If I wrote to my employer, and got him to raise the reward to some
higher amount, that might make it worth your while?"

"I should still answer that my affairs will not permit such a journey.
But if there be any chance of tracing Louise Duval at Aix,--and there
may be,--you would succeed quite as well as I should. You must judge for
yourself if it be worth your trouble to attempt such a task; and if you
do attempt it, and do succeed, pray let me know.--A line to my office
will reach me for some little time, even if I am absent from Paris.
Adieu, Monsieur Lamb."

Here M. Lebeau Lose and departed.

Graham relapsed into thought; but a train of thought much more active,
much more concentred than before. "No," thus ran his meditations,--"no,
it would not be safe to employ that man further. The reasons that forbid
me to offer any very high reward for the discovery of this woman operate
still more strongly against tendering to her own relation a sum that
might indeed secure his aid, but would unquestionably arouse his
suspicions, and perhaps drag into light all that must be concealed.
Oh, this cruel mission! I am, indeed, an impostor to myself till it be
fulfilled. I will go to Aix, and take Renard with me. I am impatient
till I set out, but I cannot quit Paris without once more seeing Isaura.
She consents to relinquish the stage; surely I could wean her too from
intimate friendship with a woman whose genius has so fatal an effect
upon enthusiastic minds. And then--and then?"

He fell into a delightful revery; and contemplating Isaura as his future
wife, he surrounded her sweet image with all those attributes of
dignity and respect with which an Englishman is accustomed to invest the
destined bearer of his name, the gentle sovereign of his household,
the sacred mother of his children. In this picture the more brilliant
qualities of Isaura found, perhaps, but faint presentation. Her glow of
sentiment, her play of fancy, her artistic yearnings for truths remote,
for the invisible fairyland of beautiful romance, receded into the
background of the picture. It was all these, no doubt, that had so
strengthened and enriched the love at first sight, which had shaken the
equilibrium of his positive existence; and yet he now viewed all these
as subordinate to the one image of mild decorous matronage into which
wedlock was to transform the child of genius, longing for angel wings
and unlimited space.




CHAPTER V.

On quitting the sorry apartment of the false M. Lamb, Lebeau walked
on with slow steps and bended head, like a man absorbed in thought.
He threaded a labyrinth of obscure streets, no longer in the Faubourg
Montmartre, and dived at last into one of the few courts which preserve
the cachet of the moyen age untouched by the ruthless spirit of
improvement which during the second empire has so altered the face of
Paris. At the bottom of the court stood a large house, much dilapidated,
but bearing the trace of former grandeur in pilasters and fretwork in
the style of the Renaissance, and a defaced coat of arms, surmounted
with a ducal coronet, over the doorway. The house had the aspect of
desertion: many of the windows were broken; others were jealously closed
with mouldering shutters. The door stood ajar; Lebeau pushed it open,
and the action set in movement a bell within a porter's lodge.
The house, then, was not uninhabited; it retained the dignity of a
concierge. A man with a large grizzled beard cut square, and holding a
journal in his hand, emerged from the lodge, and moved his cap with a
certain bluff and surly reverence on recognizing Lebeau.

"What! so early, citizen?"

"Is it too early?" said Lebeau, glancing at his watch. "So it is; I
was not aware of the time. But I am tired with waiting; let me into
the salon. I will wait for the rest; I shall not be sorry for a little
repose."

"Bon," said the porter, sententiously; "while man reposes men advance."

"A profound truth, citizen Le Roux; though if they advance on a reposing
foe, they have blundering leaders unless they march through unguarded
by-paths and with noiseless tread."

Following the porter up a dingy broad staircase, Lebeau was admitted
into a large room, void of all other furniture than a table, two benches
at its sides, and a fauteuil at its head. On the mantelpiece there was a
huge clock, and some iron sconces were fixed on the panelled walls.

Lebeau flung himself, with a wearied air, into the fauteuil. The porter
looked at him with a kindly expression. He had a liking to Lebeau, whom
he had served in his proper profession of messenger or commissionnaire
before being placed by that courteous employer in the easy post he
now held. Lebeau, indeed, had the art, when he pleased, of charming
inferiors; his knowledge of mankind allowed him to distinguish
peculiarities in each individual, and flatter the amour propre by
deference to such eccentricities. Marc le Roux, the roughest of "red
caps," had a wife of whom he was very proud. He would have called the
empress Citoyenne Eugenie, but he always spoke of his wife as Madame.
Lebeau won his heart by always asking after Madame.

"You look tired, citizen," said the porter; "let me bring you a glass of
wine."

"Thank you, mon ami, no. Perhaps later, if I have time, after we break
up, to pay my respects to Madame."

The porter smiled, bowed, and retired muttering, "Nom d'un petit
bonhomme; il n'y a rien de tel que les belles manieres."

Left alone, Lebeau leaned his elbow on the table, resting his chin on
his hand, and gazing into the dim space,--for it was now, indeed, night,
and little light came through the grimy panes of the one window left
unclosed by shutters. He was musing deeply. This man was, in much, an
enigma to himself. Was he seeking to unriddle it? A strange compound
of contradictory elements. In his stormy youth there had been
lightning-like flashes of good instincts, of irregular honour, of
inconsistent generosity,--a puissant wild nature, with strong passions
of love and of hate, without fear, but not without shame. In other forms
of society that love of applause which had made him seek and exult in
the notoriety which he mistook for fame might have settled down into
some solid and useful ambition. He might have become great in the
world's eye, for at the service of his desires there were no ordinary
talents. Though too true a Parisian to be a severe student, still, on
the whole, he had acquired much general information, partly from books,
partly from varied commerce with mankind. He had the gift, both by
tongue and by pen, of expressing himself with force and warmth; time and
necessity had improved that gift. Coveting, during his brief career of
fashion, the distinctions which necessitate lavish expenditure, he had
been the most reckless of spendthrifts; but the neediness which follows
waste had never destroyed his original sense of personal honour.
Certainly Victor de Mauleon was not, at the date of his fall, a man to
whom the thought of accepting, much less of stealing, the jewels of
a woman who loved him could have occurred as a possible question of
casuistry between honour and temptation. Nor could that sort of question
have, throughout the sternest trials or the humblest callings to which
his after-life had been subjected, forced admission into his brain.
He was one of those men, perhaps the most terrible though unconscious
criminals, who are the offsprings produced by intellectual power and
egotistical ambition. If you had offered to Victor de Mauleon the crown
of the Caesars, on condition of his doing one of those base things
which "a gentleman" cannot do, pick a pocket, cheat at cards,--Victor
de Mauleon would have refused the crown. He would not have refused on
account of any laws of morality affecting the foundations of the
social system, but from the pride of his own personality. "I, Victor
de Mauleon! I pick a pocket! I cheat at cards! I!" But when something
incalculably worse for the interests of society than picking a pocket
or cheating at cards was concerned; when for the sake either of private
ambition or political experiment hitherto untested, and therefore very
doubtful, the peace and order and happiness of millions might be exposed
to the release of the most savage passions, rushing on revolutionary
madness or civil massacre, then this French dare-devil would have been
just as unscrupulous as any English philosopher whom a metropolitan
borough might elect as its representative. The system of the empire was
in the way of Victor de Mauleon,--in the way of his private ambition, in
the way of his political dogmas; and therefore it must be destroyed, no
matter what nor whom it crushed beneath its ruins. He was one of those
plotters of revolutions not uncommon in democracies, ancient and modern,
who invoke popular agencies with the less scruple because they have a
supreme contempt for the populace. A man with mental powers equal to De
Mauleon's, and who sincerely loves the people and respects the grandeur
of aspiration with which, in the great upheaving of their masses, they
so often contrast the irrational credulities of their ignorance and
the blind fury of their wrath, is always exceedingly loath to pass the
terrible gulf that divides reform from revolution. He knows how rarely
it happens that genuine liberty is not disarmed in the passage, and what
sufferings must be undergone by those who live by their labour during
the dismal intervals between the sudden destruction of one form of
society and the gradual settlement of another. Such a man, however, has
no type in a Victor de Mauleon. The circumstances of his life had placed
this strong nature at war with society, and corrupted into misanthropy
affections that had once been ardent. That misanthropy made his ambition
more intense, because it increased his scorn for the human instruments
it employed.

Victor de Mauleon knew that however innocent of the charges that had so
long darkened his name, and however--thanks to his rank, his manners,
his savoir vivre, the aid of Louvier's countenance and the support of
his own high-born connections--he might restore himself to his rightful
grade in private life, the higher prizes in public life would scarcely
be within reach, to a man of his antecedents and stinted means, in the
existent form and conditions of established political order. Perforce,
the aristocrat must make himself democrat if he would become a political
chief. Could he assist in turning upside down the actual state of
things, he trusted to his individual force of character to find himself
among the uppermost in the general bouleversement. And in the first
stage of popular revolution the mob has no greater darling than
the noble who deserts his order, though in the second stage it may
guillotine him at the denunciation of his cobbler. A mind so sanguine
and so audacious as that of Victor de Mauleon never thinks of the second
step if it sees a way to the first.




CHAPTER VI.

The room was in complete darkness, save where a ray from a gas-lamp at
the mouth of the court came aslant through the window, when citizen Le
Roux re-entered, closed the window, lighted two of the sconces, and drew
forth from a drawer in the table implements of writing, which he placed
thereon noiselessly, as if he feared to disturb M. Lebeau, whose head,
buried in his hands, rested on the table. He seemed in a profound
sleep. At last the porter gently touched the arm of the slumberer, and
whispered in his ear, "It is on the stroke of ten, citizen; they will be
here in a minute or so." Lebeau lifted his head drowsily.

"Eh," said he--"what?"

"You have been asleep."

"I suppose so, for I have been dreaming. Ha! I hear the door-bell. I am
wide awake now."

The porter left him, and in a few minutes conducted into the salon two
men wrapped in cloaks, despite the warmth of the summer night. Lebeau
shook hands with them silently, and not less silently they laid aside
their cloaks and seated themselves. Both these men appeared to belong to
the upper section of the middle class. One, strongly built, with a
keen expression of countenance, was a surgeon considered able in his
profession, but with limited practice, owing to a current suspicion
against his honour in connection with a forged will. The other, tall,
meagre, with long grizzled hair and a wild unsettled look about the
eyes, was a man of science; had written works well esteemed upon
mathematics and electricity, also against the existence of any other
creative power than that which he called "nebulosity," and defined to be
the combination of heat and moisture. The surgeon was about the age of
forty, the atheist a few years older. In another minute or so, a knock
was heard against the wall. One of the men rose and touched a spring
in the panel, which then flew back, and showed an opening upon a narrow
stair, by which, one after the other, entered three other members of the
society. Evidently there was more than one mode of ingress and exit.

The three new-comers were not Frenchmen,--one might see that at a
glance; probably they had reasons for greater precaution than those who
entered by the front door. One, a tall, powerfully-built man, with fair
hair and beard, dressed with a certain pretension to elegance,--faded
threadbare elegance,--exhibiting no appearance of linen, was a Pole.
One, a slight bald man, very dark and sallow, was an Italian. The third,
who seemed like an ouvrier in his holiday clothes, was a Belgian.

Lebeau greeted them all with an equal courtesy, and each with an equal
silence took his seat at the table.

Lebeau glanced at the clock. "Confreres," he said, "our number as fixed
for this seance still needs two to be complete, and doubtless they will
arrive in a few minutes. Till they come, we can but talk upon trifles.
Permit me to offer you my cigar-case." And so saying, he who professed
to be no smoker handed his next neighbour, who was the Pole, a large
cigar-case amply furnished; and the Pole, helping himself to two cigars,
handed the case to the man next him,--two only declining the luxury,
the Italian and the Belgian. But the Pole was the only man who took two
cigars.

Steps were now heard on the stairs, the door opened, and citizen Le
Toux ushered in, one after the other, two men, this time unmistakably
French,--to an experienced eye unmistakably Parisians: the one, a young
beardless man, who seemed almost boyish, with a beautiful face, and
a stinted, meagre frame; the other, a stalwart man of about eight-and
twenty, dressed partly as an ouvrier, not in his Sunday clothes, rather
affecting the blouse,--not that he wore that antique garment, but that
he was in rough costume unbrushed and stained, with thick shoes and
coarse stockings, and a workman's cap. But of all who gathered round
the table at which M. Lebeau presided, he had the most distinguished
exterior,--a virile honest exterior, a massive open forehead,
intelligent eyes, a handsome clear-cut incisive profile, and solid jaw.
The expression of the face was stern, but not mean,--an expression which
might have become an ancient baron as well as a modern workman; in it
plenty of haughtiness and of will, and still more of self-esteem.

"Confreres," said Lebeau, rising, and every eye turned to him, "our
number for the present seance is complete. To business. Since we last
met, our cause has advanced with rapid and not with noiseless stride. I
need not tell you that Louis Bonaparte has virtually abnegated Les idees
Napoleoniennes,--a fatal mistake for him, a glorious advance for us. The
liberty of the press must very shortly be achieved, and with it personal
government must end. When the autocrat once is compelled to go by the
advice of his ministers, look for sudden changes. His ministers will be
but weathercocks, turned hither and thither according as the wind chops
at Paris; and Paris is the temple of the winds. The new revolution is
almost at hand. [Murmurs of applause.] It would move the laughter of the
Tuileries and its ministers, of the Bourse and of its gamblers, of every
dainty salon of this silken city of would-be philosophers and wits, if
they were told that here within this mouldering baraque, eight men, so
little blessed by fortune, so little known to fame as ourselves, met
to concert the fall of an empire. The Government would not deem us
important enough to notice our existence."

"I know not that," interrupted the Pole.

"Ah, pardon," resumed the orator; "I should have confined my remark
to the five of us who are French. I did injustice to the illustrious
antecedents of our foreign allies. I know that you, Thaddeus Loubisky,
that you, Leonardo Raselli, have been too eminent for hands hostile to
tyrants not to be marked with a black cross in the books of the police;
I know that you, Jan Vanderstegen, if hitherto unscarred by those wounds
in defence of freedom which despots and cowards would fain miscall the
brands of the felon, still owe it to your special fraternity to
keep your movements rigidly concealed. The tyrant would suppress the
International Society, and forbids it the liberty of congress. To
you three is granted the secret entrance to our council-hall. But we
Frenchmen are as yet safe in our supposed insignificance. Confreres,
permit me to impress on you the causes why, insignificant as we seem, we
are really formidable. In the first place, we are few: the great mistake
in most secret associations has been to admit many councillors; and
disunion enters wherever many tongues can wrangle. In the next place,
though so few in council, we are legion when the time comes for action;
because we are representative men, each of his own section, and each
section is capable of an indefinite expansion.

"You, valiant Pole, you, politic Italian, enjoy the confidence of
thousands now latent in unwatched homes and harmless callings, but who,
when you lift a finger, will, like the buried dragon's teeth, spring
up into armed men. You, Jan Vanderstegen, the trusted delegate from
Verviers, that swarming camp of wronged labour in its revolt from the
iniquities of capital,--you, when the hour arrives, can touch the wire
that flashes the telegram 'Arise' through all the lands in which workmen
combine against their oppressors.

"Of us five Frenchmen, let me speak more modestly. You, sage and
scholar, Felix Ruvigny, honoured alike for the profundity of your
science and the probity of your manners, induced to join us by your
abhorrence of priestcraft and superstition,--you made a wide connection
among all the enlightened reasoners who would emancipate the mind of
man from the trammels of Church-born fable, and when the hour arrives in
which it is safe to say, 'Delenda est Roma,' you know where to find the
pens that are more victorious than swords against a Church and a Creed.
You" (turning to the surgeon)--"you, Gaspard le Noy, whom a vile calumny
has robbed of the throne in your profession so justly due to your skill,
you, nobly scorning the rich and great, have devoted yourself to tend
and heal the humble and the penniless, so that you have won the popular
title of the 'Medecin des Pauvres,' when the time comes wherein soldiers
shall fly before the sansculottes, and the mob shall begin the work
which they who move mobs will complete, the clients of Gaspard le Noy
will be the avengers of his wrongs.

"You, Armand Monnier, simple ouvrier, but of illustrious parentage, for
your grandsire was the beloved friend of the virtuous Robespierre, your
father perished a hero and a martyr in the massacre of the coup d'etat;
you, cultured in the eloquence of Robespierre himself, and in the
persuasive philosophy of Robespierre's teacher, Rousseau; you, the
idolized orator of the Red Republicans,--you will be indeed a chief of
dauntless bands when the trumpet sounds for battle. Young publicist and
poet, Gustave Rameau,--I care not which you are at present, I know what
you will be soon, you need nothing for the development of your powers
over the many but an organ for their manifestation. Of that anon. I now
descend into the bathos of egotism. I am compelled lastly to speak of
myself. It was at Marseilles and Lyons, as you already know, that I
first conceived the plan of this representative association. For
years before I had been in familiar intercourse with the friends of
freedom,--that is, with the foes of the Empire. They are not all poor;
some few are rich and generous. I do not say these rich and few concur
in the ultimate objects of the poor and many; 'but they concur in the
first object, the demolition of that which exists,--the Empire. In the
course of my special calling of negotiator or agent in the towns of the
Midi, I formed friendships with some of these prosperous malcontents;
and out of these friendships I conceived the idea which is embodied in
this council.

"According to that conception, while the council may communicate as it
will with all societies, secret or open, having revolution for their
object, the council refuses to merge itself in any other confederation;
it stands aloof and independent; it declines to admit into its code
any special articles of faith in a future beyond the bounds to which
it limits its design and its force. That design unites us; to go beyond
would divide. We all agree to destroy the Napoleonic dynasty; none of
us might agree as to what we should place in its stead. All of us here
present might say, 'A republic.' Ay, but of what kind? Vanderstegen
would have it socialistic; Monnier goes further, and would have it
communistic, on the principles of Fourier; Le Noy adheres to the policy
of Danton, and would commence the republic by a reign of terror; our
Italian ally abhors the notion of general massacre, and advocates
individual assassination. Ruvigny would annihilate the worship of a
Deity; Monnier holds with Voltaire and Robespierre, that, 'if there were
no Deity, it would be necessary to man to create one.' Bref, we could
not agree upon any plan for the new edifice, and therefore we refuse to
discuss one till the ploughshare has gone over the ruins of the old.
But I have another and more practical reason for keeping our council
distinct from all societies with professed objects beyond that of
demolition. We need a certain command of money. It is I who bring to you
that, and--how? Not from my own resources,--they but suffice to support
myself; not by contributions from ouvriers who, as you well know,
will subscribe only for their own ends in the victory of workmen over
masters. I bring money to you from the coffers of the rich malcontents.
Their politics are not those of most present; their politics are what
they term moderate. Some are indeed for a republic, but for a republic
strong in defence of order, in support of property; others--and they are
more numerous and the more rich--for a constitutional monarchy, and, if
possible, for the abridgment of universal suffrage, which in their eyes
tends only to anarchy in the towns and arbitrary rule under priestly
influence in the rural districts. They would not subscribe a sou if they
thought it went to further the designs whether of Ruvigny the atheist,
or of Monnier, who would enlist the Deity of Rousseau on the side of
the drapeau rouge; not a sou if they knew I had the honour to boast such
confreres as I see around me. They subscribe, as we concert, for the
fall of Bonaparte. The policy I adopt I borrow from the policy of the
English Liberals. In England, potent millionnaires, high-born dukes,
devoted Churchmen, belonging to the Liberal party, accept the services
of men who look forward to measures which would ruin capital, eradicate
aristocracy, and destroy the Church, provided these men combine with
them in some immediate step onward against the Tories. They have a
proverb which I thus adapt to French localities: if a train passes
Fontainebleau on its way to Marseilles, why should I not take it to
Fontainebleau because other passengers are going on to Marseilles?

"Confreres, it seems to me the moment has come when we may venture some
of the fund placed at my disposal to other purposes than those to which
it has been hitherto devoted. I propose, therefore, to set up a journal
under the auspices of Gustave Rameau as editor-in-chief,--a journal
which, if he listen to my advice, will create no small sensation.
It will begin with a tone of impartiality; it will refrain from all
violence of invective; it will have wit, it will have sentiment, and
eloquence; it will win its way into the salons and cafes of educated
men; and then, and then, when it does change from polished satire into
fierce denunciation and sides with the blouses, its effect will be
startling and terrific. Of this I will say more to citizen Rameau in
private. To you I need not enlarge upon the fact that, at Paris, a
combination of men, though immeasurably superior to us in status or
influence, without a journal at command is nowhere; with such a journal,
written not to alarm but to seduce fluctuating opinions, a combination
of men immeasurably inferior to us may be anywhere.

"Confreres, this affair settled, I proceed to distribute amongst you
sums of which each who receives will render me an account, except our
valued confrere the Pole. All that we can subscribe to the cause of
humanity a representative of Poland requires for himself." (A suppressed
laugh among all but the Pole, who looked round with a grave, imposing
air, as much as to say, "What is there to laugh at?--a simple truth.")

M. Lebeau then presented to each of his confreres a sealed envelope,
containing no doubt a bank-note, and perhaps also private instructions
as to its disposal. It was one of his rules to make the amount of any
sum granted to an individual member of the society from the fund at his
disposal a confidential secret between himself and the recipient.
Thus jealousy was avoided if the sums were unequal; and unequal they
generally were. In the present instance the two largest sums were given
to the "Medecin des Pauvres" and to the delegate from Verviers. Both
were no doubt to be distributed among "the poor," at the discretion of
the trustee appointed.

Whatever rules with regard to the distribution of money M. Lebeau
laid down were acquiesced in without demur, for the money was found
exclusively by himself, and furnished without the pale of the Secret
Council, of which he had made himself founder and dictator. Some other
business was then discussed, sealed reports from each member were handed
to the president, who placed them unopened in his pocket, and resumed,
"Confreres, our seance is now concluded. The period for our next meeting
must remain indefinite, for I myself shall leave Paris as soon as I
have set on foot the journal, on the details of which I will confer with
citizen Rameau. I am not satisfied with the progress made by the two
travelling missionaries who complete our Council of Ten; and though I do
not question their zeal, I think my experience may guide it if I take a
journey to the towns of Bordeaux and Marseilles, where they now are. But
should circumstances demanding concert or action arise, you may be sure
that I will either summon a meeting or transmit instructions to such
of our members as may be most usefully employed. For the present,
confreres, you are relieved. Remain only you, dear young author."




CHAPTER VII.

Left alone with Gustave Rameau, the President of the Secret Council
remained silently musing for some moments; but his countenance was no
longer moody and overcast,--his nostrils were dilated, as in triumph;
there was a half-smile of pride on his lips. Rameau watched him
curiously and admiringly. The young man had the impressionable,
excitable temperament common to Parisian genius,--especially when it
nourishes itself on absinthe. He enjoyed the romance of belonging to a
secret society; he was acute enough to recognize the sagacity by which
this small conclave was kept out of those crazed combinations for
impracticable theories more likely to lead adventurers to the Tarpeian
Rock than to the Capitol, while yet those crazed combinations might,
in some critical moment, become strong instruments in the hands of
practical ambition. Lebeau fascinated him, and took colossal proportions
in his intoxicated vision,--vision indeed intoxicated at this moment,
for before it floated the realized image of his aspirations,--a journal
of which he was to be the editor-in-chief; in which his poetry, his
prose, should occupy space as large as he pleased; through which his
name, hitherto scarce known beyond a literary clique, would resound
in salon and club and cafe, and become a familiar music on the lips of
fashion. And he owed this to the man seated there,--a prodigious man.

"Cher poete," said Lebeau, breaking silence, "it gives me no mean
pleasure to think I am opening a career to one whose talents fit him
for those goals on which they who reach write names that posterity
shall read. Struck with certain articles of yours in the journal made
celebrated by the wit and gayety of Savarin, I took pains privately to
inquire into your birth, your history, connections, antecedents. All
confirmed my first impression,--that you were exactly the writer I
wish to secure to our cause. I therefore sought you in your rooms,
unintroduced and a stranger, in order to express my admiration of your
compositions. Bref, we soon became friends; and after comparing minds,
I admitted you, at your request, into this Secret Council. Now, in
proposing to you the conduct of the journal I would establish, for
which I am prepared to find all necessary funds, I am compelled to
make imperative conditions. Nominally you will be editor-in-chief: that
station, if the journal succeeds, will secure you position and fortune;
if it fail, you fail with it. But we will not speak of failure; I must
have it succeed. Our interest, then, is the same. Before that
interest all puerile vanities fade away. Nominally, I say, you are
editor-in-chief; but all the real work of editing will, at first, be
done by others."

"Ah!" exclaimed Rameau, aghast and stunned. Lebeau resumed,

"To establish the journal I propose needs more than the genius of youth;
it needs the tact and experience of mature years."

Rameau sank back on his chair with a sullen sneer on his pale lips.
Decidedly Lebeau was not so great a man as he had thought.

"A certain portion of the journal," continued Lebeau, "will be
exclusively appropriated to your pen."

Rameau's lip lost the sneer.

"But your pen must be therein restricted to compositions of pure fancy,
disporting in a world that does not exist; or, if on graver themes
connected with the beings of the world that does exist, the subjects
will be dictated to you and revised. Yet even in the higher departments
of a journal intended to make way at its first start, we need the aid,
not indeed of men who write better than you, but of men whose fame is
established,--whose writings, good or bad, the public run to read, and
will find good even if they are bad. You must consign one column to the
playful comments and witticisms of Savarin."

"Savarin? But he has a journal of his own. He will not, as an author,
condescend to write in one just set up by me; and as a politician, he as
certainly will not aid in an ultrademocratic revolution. If he care for
politics at all, he is a constitutionalist, an Orleanist."

"Enfant! as an author Savarin will condescend to contribute to your
journal, first, because it in no way attempts to interfere with his own;
secondly,--I can tell you a secret, Savarin's journal no longer suffices
for his existence. He has sold more than two-thirds of its property;
he is in debt, and his creditor is urgent; and to-morrow you will offer
Savarin thirty thousand francs for one column from his pen, and signed
by his name, for two months from the day the journal starts. He will
accept, partly because the sum will clear off the debt that hampers him,
partly because he will take care that the amount becomes known; and
that will help him to command higher terms for the sale of the remaining
shares in the journal he now edits, for the new book which you told me
he intended to write, and for the new journal which he will be sure to
set up as soon as he has disposed of the old one. You say that, as a
politician, Savarin, an Orleanist, will not aid in an ultra-democratic
revolution. Who asks him to do so? Did I not imply at the meeting that
we commence our journal with politics the mildest? Though revolutions
are not made with rose-water, it is rose-water that nourishes their
roots. The polite cynicism of authors, read by those who float on the
surface of society, prepares the way for the social ferment in its
deeps. Had there been no Voltaire, there would have been no Camille
Desmoulins; had there been no Diderot, there would have been no Marat.
We start as polite cynics. Of all cynics Savarin is the politest. But
when I bid high for him, it is his clique that I bid for. Without his
clique he is but a wit; with his clique, a power. Partly out of that
clique, partly out of a circle beyond it, which Savarin can more or less
influence, I select ten. Here is the list of them; study it. Entre nous,
I esteem their writings as little as I do artificial flies; but they are
the artificial flies at which, in this particular season of the year,
the public rise. You must procure at least five of the ten; and I leave
you carte blanche as to the terms. Savarin gained, the best of them will
be proud of being his associates. Observe, none of these messieurs of
brilliant imagination are to write political articles; those will be
furnished to you anonymously, and inserted without erasure or omission.
When you have secured Savarin, and five at least of the collaborateurs
in the list, write to me at my office. I give you four days to do this;
and the day the journal starts you enter into the income of fifteen
thousand francs a year, with a rise in salary proportioned to profits.
Are you contented with the terms?"

"Of course I am; but supposing I do not gain the aid of Savarin, or five
at least of the list you give, which I see at a glance contains names
the most a la mode in this kind of writing, more than one of them of
high social rank, whom it is difficult for me even to approach,--if, I
say, I fail?"

"What! with a carte blanche of terms? fie! Are you a Parisian? Well, to
answer you frankly, if you fail in so easy a task, you are not the man
to edit our journal, and I shall find another. Allez, courage! Take my
advice; see Savarin the first thing to-morrow morning. Of course, my
name and calling you will keep a profound secret from him, as from all.
Say as mysteriously as you can that parties you are forbidden to name
instruct you to treat with M. Savarin, and offer him the terms I have
specified, the thirty thousand francs paid to him in advance the moment
he signs the simple memorandum of agreement. The more mysterious you
are, the more you will impose,--that is, wherever you offer money and
don't ask for it."

Here Lebeau took up his hat, and, with a courteous nod of adieu, lightly
descended the gloomy stairs.




CHAPTER VIII.

At night, after this final interview with Lebeau, Graham took leave for
good of his lodgings in Montmartre, and returned to his apartment in
the Rue d'Anjou. He spent several hours of the next morning in answering
numerous letters accumulated during his absence. Late in the afternoon
he had an interview with M. Renard, who, as at that season of the year
he was not over-busied with other affairs, engaged to obtain leave to
place his services at Graham's command during the time requisite for
inquiries at Aix, and to be in readiness to start the next day. Graham
then went forth to pay one or two farewell visits; and these over,
bent his way through the Champs Elysees towards Isaura's villa, when he
suddenly encountered Rochebriant on horseback. The Marquis courteously
dismounted, committing his horse to the care of the groom, and linking
his arm in Graham's, expressed his pleasure at seeing him again;
then, with some visible hesitation and embarrassment, he turned the
conversation towards the political aspects of France.

"There was," he said, "much in certain words of yours, when we last
walked together in this very path, that sank deeply into my mind at the
time, and over which I have of late still more earnestly reflected. You
spoke of the duties a Frenchman owed to France, and the 'impolicy' of
remaining aloof from all public employment on the part of those attached
to the Legitimist cause."

"True; it cannot be the policy of any party to forget that between the
irrevocable past and the uncertain future there intervenes the action of
the present time."

"Should you, as an impartial bystander, consider it dishonourable in me
if I entered the military service under the ruling sovereign?"

"Certainly not, if your country needed you."

"And it may, may it not? I hear vague rumours of coming war in almost
every salon I frequent. There has been gunpowder in the atmosphere
we breathe ever since the battle of Sadowa. What think you of German
arrogance and ambition? Will they suffer the swords of France to rust in
their scabbards?"

"My dear Marquis, I should incline to put the question otherwise. Will
the jealous amour propre of France permit the swords of Germany to
remain sheathed? But in either case, no politician can see without grave
apprehension two nations so warlike, close to each other, divided by a
borderland that one covets and the other will not yield, each armed
to the teeth,--the one resolved to brook no rival, the other equally
determined to resist all aggression. And therefore, as you say, war is
in the atmosphere; and we may also hear, in the clouds that give no sign
of dispersion, the growl of the gathering thunder. War may come any day;
and if France be not at once the victor--"

"France not at once the victor?" interrupted Alain, passionately; "and
against a Prussian! Permit me to say no Frenchman can believe that."

"Let no man despise a foe," said Graham, smiling half sadly. "However, I
must not incur the danger of wounding your national susceptibilities. To
return to the point you raise. If France needed the aid of her best
and bravest, a true descendant of Henri Quatre ought to blush for his
ancient noblesse were a Rochebriant to say, 'But I don't like the colour
of the flag.'"

"Thank you," said Alain, simply; "that is enough." There was a pause,
the young men walking on slowly, arm in arm. And then there flashed
across Graham's mind the recollection of talk on another subject in that
very path. Here he had spoken to Alain in deprecation of any possible
alliance with Isaura Cicogna, the destined actress and public; singer.
His cheek flushed; his heart smote him. What! had he spoken slightingly
of her--of her? What if she became his own wife? What! had he himself
failed in the respect which he would demand as her right from the
loftiest of his high-born kindred? What, too, would this man, of fairer
youth than himself, think of that disparaging counsel, when he heard
that the monitor had won the prize from which he had warned another?
Would it not seem that he had but spoken in the mean cunning dictated by
the fear of a worthier rival? Stung by these thoughts, he arrested his
steps, and, looking the Marquis full in the face, said, "You remind me
of one subject in our talk many weeks since; it is my duty to remind
you of another. At that time you, and, speaking frankly, I myself,
acknowledged the charm in the face of a young Italian lady. I told you
then that, on learning she was intended for the stage, the charm for me
had vanished. I said bluntly that it should vanish perhaps still more
utterly for a noble of your illustrious name; you remember?"

"Yes," answered Alain, hesitatingly, and with a look of surprise.

"I wish now to retract all I said thereon. Mademoiselle Cicogna is not
bent on the profession for which she was educated. She would willingly
renounce all idea of entering it. The only counterweight which, viewed
whether by my reason or my prejudices, could be placed in the opposite
scale to that of the excellences which might make any man proud to win
her, is withdrawn. I have become acquainted with her since the date of
our conversation. Hers is a mind which harmonizes with the loveliness of
her face. In one word, Marquis, I should deem myself honoured, as well
as blest, by such a bride. It was due to her that I should say this; it
was due also to you, in case you should retain the impression I sought
in ignorance to efface. And I am bound, as a gentleman, to obey this
twofold duty, even though in so doing I bring upon myself the affliction
of a candidate for the hand to which I would fain myself aspire,--a
candidate with pretensions in every way far superior to my own."

An older or a more cynical man than Alain de Rochebriant might well have
found something suspicious in a confession thus singularly volunteered;
but the Marquis was himself so loyal that he had no doubt of the loyalty
of Graham.
