Polaris revolves around the true pole once in twenty-four hours in a
little circle 2-1/2[deg] in diameter. Within this circle two hundred stars
have been photographed.

The North Star is always elevated as many degrees above the horizon as
the observer is north of the equator.

Compare the light of the four stars forming the bowl of the "Little
Dipper," as they are each of a different magnitude. A standard
first-magnitude star is 2-1/2 times brighter than a standard second
magnitude star, etc.

GEMINI (jem'-i-ni)--THE TWINS. (Face West.)


LOCATION.--A line drawn from [b] to [k] Ursae Majoris and prolonged an
equal distance ends near Castor, in Gemini. Gemini is characterized by
two nearly parallel rows of stars. The northern row if extended would
reach Taurus, the southern one Orion. Note the fine cluster 35 M.
Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781 a short distance southwest of it.
Two wonderful streams of little stars run parallel northwest on each
side of the cluster. Where the ecliptic crosses the solstitial colure
is the spot where the sun appears to be when it is farthest north of
the equator, June 21st. Castor is a fine double for a telescope, and
Pollux has three little attendant stars. An isoceles triangle is
formed by Castor, Aldebaran in Taurus, and Capella in Auriga. There is
a record of an occultation in Gemini noted about the middle of the
fourth century B.C.

The Arabs saw in this group of stars two peacocks, the Egyptians two
sprouting plants, and the Hindus twin deities, while in the Buddhist
zodiac they represented a woman holding a golden cord. Since classic
times, however, the figure has always been that of human twins.

At the point indicated near [th] a new star was discovered by Enebo in
March, 1912. It attained a maximum of about magnitude 3.5 and has at
this writing waned to the eleventh magnitude.

[Illustration: GEMINI]




AURIGA ([^a]-ri'-ga)--THE CHARIOTEER. (Face Northwest.)


LOCATION.--A line drawn from [d] to [a] Ursae Majoris, and prolonged
about 45[deg], ends near the bright Capella, in Auriga, a star of the
first magnitude, and one of the most brilliant in the heavens. It is
unmistakable, having no rival in brightness near it. Auriga is a
beautiful and conspicuous constellation. It is characterized by a
clearly defined pentagon. Note the three fourth-magnitude stars near
Capella known as "The Kids." The star [b] is common to Auriga and
Taurus, being the former's right foot and the latter's northern horn.
The field within the pentagon is particularly rich in clusters.
Capella forms a rude square with Polaris, [e] Cassiopeiae, and [o] Ursae
Majoris, and forms an equilateral triangle with Betelgeuze in Orion,
and the Pleiades in Taurus.

A line from [th] to [a] Aurigae prolonged about 20[deg] ends near [a]
Persei.

Capella is visible at some hour of every clear night throughout the
year. Of the first-magnitude stars it is nearest to the Pole, and it
rises almost exactly in the northeast.

To the Arabs Capella was "The Driver," because it seemed to rise
earlier than the other stars and so apparently watched over them, or
still more practically as "The Singer" who rode before the procession
cheering on the camels, which last were represented by the Pleiades.

[Illustration: AURIGA]




CANCER (kan'-ser)--THE CRAB. (Face West.)


LOCATION.--Cancer lies between Gemini and Leo. A line drawn from Nath
in Auriga to Pollux in Gemini, and prolonged about 15[deg], ends in
Praesepe, the Manger, the great star cluster in Cancer, which is also
called "The Bee Hive." It contains 300 stars. The stars [g] and [d]
are called the Aselli--the ass's colts feeding from the silver manger.

The star [b] lies about 10[deg] northeast of Procyon. Acubens, [a] lies on
the same line the same distance beyond [b]. These two stars form the
tips of the inverted "Y" which distinguishes Cancer.

An imaginary line from Capella through Pollux will point out Acubens.
Close to it are two faint stars. The Bee Hive lies within an irregular
square formed by [g], [d], [[^e]], and [th], and looks like a nebula to
the naked eye.

In June, 1895, all the planets except Neptune were in this quarter of
the heavens, and Halley's comet was in this constellation on its first
appearance in 1531.

The dimness of [g] and [d] is an infallible precursor of rain, and if
the Bee Hive is not visible in a clear sky, it is a presage of a
violent storm.

[Illustration: CANCER]




HYDRA (hi'-dra)--THE SEA-SERPENT. (Face South and Southwest.)


LOCATION.--The head of Hydra, a striking and beautiful arrangement of
stars, lies just below the Bee Hive, in Cancer, 6[deg] south of Acubens in
that constellation, and forms a rhomboidal figure of five stars.

Hydra is about 100[deg] in length and reaches almost from Canis Minor to
Libra. Its stars are all faint except Alphard, or the Hydra's heart, a
second-magnitude star remarkable for its lonely situation, southwest
of Regulus, in Leo. A line drawn from [g] Leonis through Regulus
points it out. It is of a rich orange tint. Castor and Pollux, in
Gemini, point southeast to it.

The constellations Crater, the Cup, and Corvus, the Crow, both stand
on the coils of Hydra, south of Denebola, the bright star in the tail
of the Lion.

Hydra is supposed to be the snake shown on a uranographic stone from
the Euphrates, 1200 B.C.

The little asterism Sextans, the Sextant, lies in the region between
Regulus and Alphard. It contains no stars brighter than the fourth
magnitude.

[Illustration: HYDRA]




LEO (le'o)--THE LION. (Face South.)


LOCATION.--A line drawn from Pollux, in Gemini, to [g] in Cancer, and
prolonged about 12[deg], strikes Regulus, the brilliant star in the heart
of the Lion. Regulus lies about 9[deg] east of Acubens, in Cancer, and
about 12[deg] northeast of Alphard, in the heart of Hydra.

Leo is one of the most beautiful constellations in the zodiac. It lies
south of the Great Bear, and its principal stars are arranged in the
form of a sickle which nearly outlines the Lion's head. This group is
so striking as to be unmistakable. Regulus is in the handle of the
sickle. It is one of the stars from which longitude is reckoned, lies
almost exactly on the ecliptic, and is visible for eight months in the
year.

Denebola, the bright star in the Lion's tail, lies 25[deg] east of
Regulus, and about 35[deg] west of Arcturus, in Bo[:o]tes. It is the same
distance northwest of Spica, in Virgo, and forms with Spica and
Arcturus a large equilateral triangle.

[z] is double, and has three faint companion stars.

[e] has two seventh-magnitude companion stars, forming a beautiful
little triangle.

Regulus is white in color, [g] yellow, [p] red.

[g] is a beautiful colored telescopic double star and has a companion
visible in an opera-glass.

The figure of Leo very much as we now have it appears in all the
Indian and Egyptian zodiacs.

[Illustration: LEO

THE SICKLE]




COMA BERENICES (k[=o]'-ma ber-e-ni'-sez)--BERENICE'S HAIR.


LOCATION.--A line drawn from Regulus to Zosma, in Leo, and prolonged
an equal distance, strikes this fine cluster, which is 18[deg] northeast
of Zosma, [d] Leonis.

The group lies well within a triangle formed by Denebola, Arcturus, in
Bo[:o]tes, and Cor Caroli, in Canes Venatici, which triangle is the upper
half of the Diamond of Virgo.

Twenty or thirty stars in this group can be counted with an
opera-glass, and the group can be easily distinguished with the naked
eye, when the moon is not visible.

The first half of the month of April can be called the most brilliant
sidereal period of the year. At this time eleven first-magnitude stars
are visible in this latitude at 9 P.M. From east to west they are:
Vega, Arcturus, Spica, Regulus, Pollux, Procyon, Sirius, Capella,
Aldebaran, Betelgeuze, and Rigel, truly a glorious company, an
incomparable sight.

[Illustration: COMA BERENICES]




CANIS MINOR (k[=a]'-nis mi'-nor)--THE LESSER DOG. (Face West.)


LOCATION.--Procyon, the Little Dog Star, lies about 23[deg] south of
Pollux, in Gemini. A line drawn from Nath, in Auriga, to Alhena, in
Gemini, and prolonged about 18[deg], reaches Procyon.

Procyon is equidistant from Betelgeuze in Orion, and Sirius in Canis
Major, and forms with them an equilateral triangle. It forms a large
right-angled triangle with Pollux and Betelgeuze.

The light from Procyon is golden yellow. Four degrees northwest of it
is the third-magnitude star Gomeisa. The glass shows two small stars
forming a right-angled triangle with it.

Procyon was distinctly mentioned by Ptolemy. It rises in this latitude
a little north of east about half an hour before Sirius, the Dog Star,
hence it was called Procyon from two Greek words which signify "before
the dog."

Procyon is one of our nearest neighbors in space, at a distance of ten
light years, and is attended by a very faint companion which is only
visible in the largest telescopes.

[Illustration: CANIS MINOR]




CORVUS (k[^o]r'-vus)--THE CROW. (Face South.)


LOCATION.--A line drawn from the Bee Hive, in Cancer, through Regulus,
in Leo, and prolonged about 40[deg], ends near the conspicuous
quadrilateral which distinguishes Corvus. The brightest star in this
region of the sky is Spica, in Virgo. It lies about 10[deg] northeast of
Algorab.

[z] is a double star for an opera-glass. A faint pair of stars lie
close below and to the west of [b]. The Crow is represented as
standing on, and pecking at, the coils of Hydra. The star Al Chiba is
in the Crow's bill.

Corvus was known as the Raven in Chaucer's time.

[d] is an interesting telescopic double.

A line drawn from [g] to [b] Corvi and prolonged twice its length
locates the third-magnitude star [i] Centauri in the right shoulder of
the Centaur. The brightest stars in this constellation are not visible
in this latitude.

[Illustration: CORVUS]




CRATER (kr[=a]'-ter)--THE CUP. (Face South.)


LOCATION.--Crater is situated 15[deg] west of Corvus, and due south of
[th] Leonis. It is easily distinguished by reason of a beautiful and
very striking semicircle of six stars of the fourth magnitude, forming
the bowl of the cup.

The constellation resembles a goblet with its base resting on the
coils of Hydra.

The star Alkes is common to Hydra and Crater, and may be seen 24[deg]
southeast of Alphard in the heart of Hydra. It is distinguished by its
forming an equilateral triangle with [a] and [g], stars of the same
magnitude 6[deg] south and east of it.

Corvus and Crater are to be seen half-way up the southern sky during
the early evenings in spring.

[d] is now the lucida.

Crater is situated at about the centre of Hydra and is on the
meridian, April 26th. Owing to its many faint stars it is best seen on
a clear moonless night.

The zodiacal light is well worth observing at this season of the year.
It is to be seen in the western sky shortly after sundown, and is most
intense during the evenings of March.

THE CONSTELLATIONS OF SUMMER.

[Illustration: Maps showing the principal stars visible from Lat. 40[deg]
N. at 9 o'clock, July first.]




DRACO (dr[=a]'-ko)--THE DRAGON. (Face North.)


LOCATION.--About 10[deg] from [a] Ursae Majoris--from [a] to [d] is
10[deg]--slightly south of, that is above, the line from [a] to Polaris,
is Giansar, [l] in the tip of the Dragon's tail. Above [l], and almost
in line with it, are two more stars in Draco, which form with two
stars in Ursa Major a quadrilateral. (See diagram.) Draco now curves
sharply eastward, coiling about the Little Bear as shown, then turns
abruptly southerly, ending in a characteristic and clearly defined
group of four stars, forming an irregular square, representing the
Dragon's head. This group is almost overhead in the early evening in
summer. The star in the heel of Hercules lies just south of the
Dragon's head. The brilliant Vega will be seen about overhead, 12[deg]
southwest of the Dragon's head. Eltanin, one of the Dragon's eyes, is
noted for its connection with the discovery of the law of aberration
of light. It is of an orange hue, while the star [b], near it, is
white. Note Thuban, once the Pole Star, at one corner of a
quadrilateral that Draco forms with Ursa Major.

Thuban could be seen by day or night from the bottom of the central
passage of several of the Pyramids in Egypt.

The rising of Eltanin was visible about thirty-five hundred years B.C.
through the central passages of the temples of Hathor at Denderah. The
Egyptians called Draco "The Hippopotamus."

Vega and the four stars in the Dragon's head offer an opportunity to
compare the first five stellar magnitudes with which all should be
familiar.

[Illustration: DRACO]




LYRA (l[=i]'-ra)--THE LYRE.


LOCATION.--Lyra may be easily distinguished because of the brilliant
Vega, its brightest star, which is situated about 12[deg] southwest of the
Dragon's head. It is unmistakable, as it is the brightest star in this
region of the heavens, and the third brightest in this latitude. In
July and August Vega is close to the zenith in the early evening.

The six bright stars in Lyra form an equilateral triangle on one
corner of a rhomboid. A very characteristic figure.

[e] is a pretty double for an opera-glass, and a 3" glass reveals the
duplicity of each star of this pair. [e] is therefore a double double.

[z] is a double for a good glass.

[b] is a variable, changing from magnitude 3.4 to 4.4 in twelve days.
At its brightest it is about equal to its near neighbor [g] Lyrae.

The noted ring nebula lies between [b] and [g]. A 3" glass reveals it
but a powerful telescope is required to render its details visible.

If the distance from the earth to the sun equalled one inch, the
distance from the earth to Vega would be 158 miles.

Vega was the first star to be photographed, in 1850. It is visible at
some hour every clear night, and has been called the arc-light of the
sky. Its light has the bluish-white hue that suggests "a diamond in
the sky."

The spectroscope reveals that Vega is a star probably only in its
infancy, as hydrogen is its predominating element.

[Illustration: LYRA]




CYGNUS (sig'-nus)--THE SWAN, OR THE NORTHERN CROSS.


LOCATION.--Deneb, the brightest star in Cygnus, is at the top of the
cross, and a little over 20[deg] east of Vega. It forms a triangle with
Vega and Altair in Aquila--Altair being at the apex, about 35[deg] from
Deneb and Vega.

[b] Cygni is at the base of the cross, and a line drawn from Vega to
Altair nearly touches it. It is a beautiful colored double for a small
telescope.

Note "61," one of the nearest stars to us. It was the first star whose
distance was measured (by Bessel in 1838). It is a double star and
10.4 light years distant.

The cross is nearly perfect and easily traced out. It lies almost
wholly in the Milky Way.

Note "The Coal Sack," one of the dark gap in the Milky Way.

Cygnus contains an unusual number of deeply colored stars and variable
stars.

[o] Cygni has a sixth-magnitude companion, and [g] is in the midst of
a beautiful stream of faint stars.

This region is perhaps richer than any similar extent in the heavens.
