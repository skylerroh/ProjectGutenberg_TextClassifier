The Life of a Ship from the Launch to the Wreck, by R.M. Ballantyne.

________________________________________________________________________

A story for pre-teens, in which a small boy, Davy, is taken to a
shipyard to watch the building of a new sailing-vessel, the "Fair
Nancy".  Eventually Davy is allowed to sail on board of her as a
boy-seaman.  He is sea-sick at first, but soon recovers and learns how
to climb the rigging to help with the sails.  They encounter a
hurricane, which knocks the ship over, and they lose the ship's boats.
A raft is made, but only a few people can get away on it, including the
captain's wife.  The ship drifts helpless until she is wrecked on a
hostile shore.  There is only one chance for the men, and that would be
if someone could swim ashore with a rope and fasten it, so that each
member of the crew can be brought ashore with a travelling block and
harness.  This works, and no lives are lost.  They walk out of the
wilderness till they come to a village, from which they make their way
to Quebec, and thence back to England.

I find it rather a depressing story, but the intention of the book,
presumably, is to interest young people in a life at sea.

THE LIFE OF A SHIP FROM THE LAUNCH TO THE WRECK, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.



CHAPTER ONE.

THE LIFE OF A SHIP FROM THE LAUNCH TO THE WRECK.

SONG OF THE SAILOR BOY.

  Oh!  I love the great blue ocean,
  I love the whistling breeze,
  When the gallant ship sweeps lightly
  Across the surging seas.
  I watched my first ship building;
  I saw her timbers rise,
  Until her masts were towering
  Up in the bright blue skies.

  I heard the cheers ascending,
  I saw her kiss the foam,
  When first her hull went plunging
  Into her ocean home.
  Her flags were gaily streaming,
  And her sails were full and round,
  When the shout from shore came ringing,
  "Hurrah! for the Outward-bound!"

  But, alas! ere long a tempest
  Came down with awful roar
  And dashed our ship in pieces
  Upon a foreign shore.
  But He who holds the waters
  In His almighty hand,
  Brought all the sailors safely
  Back to their native land.

Davy was a fisher boy; and Davy was a very active little boy; and Davy
wanted to go to sea.  His father was a fisherman, his grandfather had
been a fisherman, and his great-grandfather had been a fisherman: so we
need not wonder much that little Davy took to the salt water like a
fish.  When he was very little he used to wade in it, and catch crabs in
it, and gather shells on the shore, or build castles on the sands.
Sometimes, too, he fell into the water neck and heels, and ran home to
his mother, who used to whip him and set him to dry before the fire;
but, as he grew older, he went with his father in the boat to fish, and
from that time forward he began to wish to go to sea in one of the large
ships that were constantly sailing away from the harbour near his
father's cottage.
