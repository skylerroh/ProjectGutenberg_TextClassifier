twenty-five dollars."

"That would be very convenient," said his mother; "but I think it will
hardly do to depend on such good luck happening to you. By the way," she
said, suddenly, "perhaps I can help you, after all. Don't you remember
that gold ring I picked up in Central Park two years ago?"

"The one you advertised?"

"Yes. I advertised, or, rather, your father did; but we never found an
owner for it."

"I remember it now, mother. Have you got the ring still?"

"I will get it."

Mrs. Hoffman went to her trunk, and, opening it, produced the ring
referred to. It was a gold ring with a single stone of considerable
size.

"I don't know how much it is worth," said Mrs. Hoffman; "but if the
ring is a diamond, as I think it is, it must be worth as much as twenty
dollars."

"Did you ever price it?"

"No, Paul; I have kept it, thinking that it would be something to fall
back upon if we should ever be hard pressed. As long as we were able to
get along without suffering, I thought I would keep it. Besides, I had
another feeling. It might belong to some person who prized it very much,
and the time might come when we could find the owner. However, that is
not likely after so long a time. So, if you cannot raise the money in
any other way, you may sell the ring."

"I might pawn it for thirty days, mother. By that time I should be able
to redeem it with the profits of my business."

"I don't think you could get enough from a pawn-broker."

"I can try, at any rate; but first I will see George Barry, and find out
whether he will take twenty dollars down, and the rest at the end of a
month."

Paul wrapped up the ring in a piece of paper, and deposited it in his
vest pocket. He waited till after dinner, and then went at once to the
necktie stand, where he made the proposal to George Barry.

The young man shook his head.

"I'd like to oblige you, Paul," he said, "but I must have the money.
I have an offer of thirty-two dollars, cash, from another party, and I
must take up with it if I can't do any better. I'd rather sell out to
you, but you know I have to consult my own interest."

"Of course, George, I can't complain of that."

"I think you will be able to borrow the money somewhere."

"Most of my friends are as poor as myself," said Paul. "Still, I think I
shall be able to raise the money. Only wait for me two days."

"Yes, Paul, I'll wait that long. I'd like to sell out to you, if only
because you have helped me when I was sick. But for you all that would
have been lost time."

"Where there's a will there's a way, George," said Paul. "I'm bound to
buy your stand and I will raise the money somehow."

Paul bought a few papers, for he did not like to lose the afternoon
trade, and in an hour had sold them all off, realizing a profit of
twenty cents. This made his profits for the day seventy cents.

"That isn't as well as I used to do," said Paul to himself, "but perhaps
I can make something more by and by. I will go now and see what I can
get for the ring."

As he had determined, he proceeded to a pawnbroker's shop which he had
often passed. It was on Chatham street, and was kept by an old man, an
Englishman by birth, who, though he lived meanly in a room behind his
shop, was popularly supposed to have accumulated a considerable fortune.



CHAPTER XV

THE PAWNBROKER'S SHOP

Stuffed behind the counter, and on the shelves of the pawnbroker's shop,
were articles in almost endless variety. All was fish that came to his
net. He was willing to advance on anything that had a marketable value,
and which promised to yield him, I was about to say, a fair profit.
But a fair profit was far from satisfying the old man. He demanded an
extortionate profit from those whom ill-fortune drove to his door for
relief.

Eliakim Henderson, for that was his name, was a small man, with a bald
head, scattering yellow whiskers, and foxlike eyes. Spiderlike he waited
for the flies who flew of their own accord into his clutches, and took
care not to let them go until he had levied a large tribute. When Paul
entered the shop, there were three customers ahead of him. One was
a young woman, whose pale face and sunken cheeks showed that she
was waging an unequal conflict with disease. She was a seamstress by
occupation, and had to work fifteen hours a day to earn the little that
was barely sufficient to keep body and soul together. Confined in her
close little room on the fourth floor, she scarcely dared to snatch time
to look out of the window into the street beneath, lest she should
not be able to complete her allotted task. A two days' sickness had
compelled her to have recourse to Eliakim Henderson. She had under her
arm a small bundle covered with an old copy of the Sun.

"What have you got there?" asked the old man, roughly. "Show it quick,
for there's others waiting."

Meekly she unfolded a small shawl, somewhat faded from long use.

"What will you give me on that?" she asked, timidly.

"It isn't worth much."

"It cost five dollars."

"Then you got cheated. It never was worth half the money. What do you
want on it?"

The seamstress intended to ask a dollar and a half, but after this
depreciation she did not venture to name so high a figure.

"A dollar and a quarter," she said.

"A dollar and a quarter!" repeated the old man, shrilly. "Take it home
with you. I don't want it."

"What will you give?" asked the poor girl, faintly.

"Fifty cents. Not a penny more."

"Fifty cents!" she repeated, in dismay, and was about to refold it. But
the thought of her rent in arrears changed her half-formed intention.

"I'll take it, sir."

The money and ticket were handed her, and she went back to her miserable
attic-room, coughing as she went.

"Now, ma'am," said Eliakim.

His new customer was an Irish woman, by no means consumptive in
appearance, red of face and portly of figure.

"And what'll ye be givin' me for this?" she asked, displaying a pair of
pantaloons.

"Are they yours, ma'am?" asked Eliakim, with a chuckle.

"It's not Bridget McCarty that wears the breeches," said that lady.
"It's me husband's, and a dacent, respectable man he is, barrin' the
drink, which turns his head. What'll ye give for 'em?"

"Name your price," said Eliakim, whose principle it was to insist upon
his customers making the first offer.

"Twelve shillin's," said Bridget.

"Twelve shillings!" exclaimed Eliakim, holding up both hands. "That's
all they cost when they were new."

"They cost every cint of five dollars," said Bridget. "They was made at
one of the most fashionable shops in the city. Oh, they was an illigant
pair when they was new."

"How many years ago was that?" asked the pawnbroker.

"Only six months, and they ain't been worn more'n a month."

"I'll give you fifty cents."

"Fifty cints!" repeated Mrs. McCarty, turning to the other customers,
as if to call their attention to an offer so out of proportion to the
valuable article she held in her hand. "Only fifty cints for these
illigant breeches! Oh, it's you that's a hard man, that lives on the
poor and the nady."

"You needn't take it. I should lose money on it, if you didn't redeem
it."

"He says he'd lose money on it," said Mrs. McCarty. "And suppose he did,
isn't he a-rollin' in gold?"

"I'm poor," said Eliakim; "almost as poor as you, because I'm too
liberal to my customers."

"Hear till him!" said Mrs. McCarty. "He says he's liberal and only
offers fifty cints for these illigant breeches."

"Will you take them or leave them?" demanded the pawnbroker,
impatiently.

"You may give me the money," said Bridget; "and it's I that wonder how
you can slape in your bed, when you are so hard on poor folks."

Mrs. McCarty departed with her money, and Eliakim fixed his sharp eyes
on the next customer. It was a tall man, shabbily dressed, with a thin,
melancholy-looking face, and the expression of one who had struggled
with the world, and failed in the struggle.

"How much for this?" he asked, pointing to the violin, and speaking in a
slow, deliberate tone, as if he did not feel at home in the language.

"What do you want for it?"

"Ten dollar," he answered.

"Ten dollars! You're crazy!" was the contemptuous comment of the
pawnbroker.

"He is a very good violin," said the man. "If you would like to hear
him," and he made a movement as if to play upon it.

"Never mind!" said Eliakim. "I haven't any time to hear it. If it were
new it would be worth something; but it's old, and----"

"But you do not understand," interrupted the customer, eagerly. "It is
worth much more than new. Do you see, it is by a famous maker? I would
not sell him, but I am poor, and my Bettina needs bread. It hurts me
very much to let him go. I will buy him back as soon as I can."

"I will give you two dollars, but I shall lose on it, unless you redeem
it."

"Two dollar!" repeated the Italian. "Ocielo! it is nothing. But Bettina
is at home without bread, poor little one! Will you not give three
dollar?"

"Not a cent more."

"I will take it."

"There's your money and ticket."

And with these the poor Italian departed, giving one last lingering
glance at his precious violin, as Eliakim took it roughly and deposited
it upon a shelf behind him. But he thought of his little daughter at
home, and the means of relief which he held in his hand, and a smile
of joy lightened his melancholy features. The future might be dark and
unpromising, but for three days, at any rate, she should not want bread.

Paul's turn came next.

"What have you got?" asked the pawnbroker.

Paul showed the ring.

Eliakim took it, and his small, beadlike eyes sparkled avariciously as
he recognized the diamond, for his experience was such that he
could form a tolerably correct estimate of its value. But he
quickly suppressed all outward manifestations of interest, and said,
indifferently, "What do you want for it?"

"I want twenty dollars," said Paul, boldly.

"Twenty dollars!" returned the pawnbroker. "That's a joke."

"No, it isn't," said Paul. "I want twenty dollars, and you can't have
the ring for less."

"If you said twenty shillings, I might give it to you," said Eliakim;
"but you must think I am a fool to give twenty dollars."

"That's cheap for a diamond ring," said Paul. "It's worth a good deal
more."

The pawnbroker eyed Paul sharply. Did the boy know that it was a diamond
ring? What chance was there of deceiving him as to its value? The old
man, whose business made him a good judge, decided that the ring was not
worth less than two hundred and fifty dollars, and if he could get it
into his possession for a trifle, it would be a paying operation.

"You're mistaken, boy," he said. "It's not a diamond."

"What is it?"

"A very good imitation."

"How much is it worth?"

"I'll give you three dollars."

"That won't do. I want to raise twenty dollars, and if I can't get that,
I'll keep the ring."

The pawnbroker saw that he had made a mistake. Paul was not as much
in need of money as the majority of his customers. He would rather pay
twenty dollars than lose the bargain, though it went against the grain
to pay so much money. But after pronouncing the stone an imitation, how
could he rise much above the offer he had already made? He resolved to
approach it gradually. Surveying it more closely, he said:

"It is an excellent imitation. I will give you five dollars."

Paul was not without natural shrewdness, and this sudden advance
convinced him that it was, after all, a real stone. He determined to get
twenty dollars or carry the ring home.

"Five dollars won't do me any good," he said. "Give me back the ring."

"Five dollars is a good deal of money," said Eliakim.

"I'd rather have the ring."

"What is your lowest price?"

"Twenty dollars."

"I'll give you eight."

"Just now you said it was worth only three," said Paul, sharply.

"It is very fine gold. It is better than I thought. Here is the money."

"You're a little too fast," said Paul, coolly. "I haven't agreed to part
with the ring for eight dollars, and I don't mean to. Twenty dollars is
my lowest price."

"I'll give you ten," said the old man, whose eagerness increased with
Paul's indifference.

"No, you won't. Give me back the ring."

"I might give eleven, but I should lose money."

"I don't want you to lose money, and I've concluded to keep the ring,"
said Paul, rightly inferring from the old man's eagerness that the ring
was much more valuable than he had at first supposed.

But the old pawnbroker was fascinated by the sparkling bauble. He
could not make up his mind to give it up. By fair means or foul he must
possess it. He advanced his bid to twelve, fourteen, fifteen dollars,
but Paul shook his head resolutely. He had made up his mind to carry
it to Ball & Black's, or some other first-class jewelers, and ascertain
whether it was a real diamond or not, and if so to obtain an estimate of
