bubbles; these bubbles do not usually, however, retain their globular
form, but are elongated in one direction through the movement of
the mass while it is still in a plastic state. The quantity of this
substance ejected is often enormous. We have seen to what a vast extent
it was thrown out from the crater of Krakatoa. During the year 1878,
masses of floating pumice were reported as existing in the vicinity of
the Solomon Isles, and covering the surface of the sea to such extent
that it took ships three days to force their way through them. Sometimes
this substance accumulates in such quantities along coasts that it is
difficult to determine the position of the shore within a mile or two,
as we may land and walk about on the great floating raft of pumice.
Recent deep-sea soundings, carried on in the Challenger and other
vessels, have shown that the bottom of the deepest portion of the ocean,
far away from the land, is covered with volcanic materials which have
been carried through the air or have floated on the surface of the
ocean.

Fragments of scoria or pumice may be thrown hundreds or thousands of
feet into the atmosphere, those that fall into the crater and are flung
up again being gradually reduced in size by friction. Thus it is related
by Mr. Poulett Scrope, who watched the Vesuvian eruption of 1822,
which lasted for nearly a month, that during the earlier stages of the
outburst fragments of enormous size were thrown out of the crater, but
by constant re-ejection these were gradually reduced in size, till
at last only the most impalpable dust issued from the vent. This dust
filled the atmosphere, producing in the city of Naples "a darkness that
might be felt." So excessively finely divided was it, that it penetrated
into all drawers, boxes, and the most closely fastened receptacles,
filling them completely. The fragmentary materials ejected from
volcanoes are often given the name of cinders or ashes. These, however,
are terms of convenience only, and do not properly describe the volcanic
material.

Sometimes the passages of steam through a mass of molten glass produces
large quantities of a material resembling spun glass. Small particles of
this glass are carried into the air and leave behind them thin, glassy
filaments like a tail. At the volcano of Kilauea in Hawaii, this
substance, as previously stated, is abundantly produced, and is known
as 'Pele's Hair'--Pele being the name of the goddess of the mountain.
Birds' nests are sometimes found composed of this beautiful material.
In recent years an artificial substance similar to this Pele's hair
has been extensively manufactured by passing jets of steam through the
molten slag of iron-furnaces; it resembles cotton-wool, but is made up
of fine threads of glass, and is employed for the packing of boilers and
other purposes.

The lava itself, as left in huge deposits upon the surface, assumes
various forms, some crystalline, others glassy. The latter is usually
found in the condition known as obsidian, ordinarily black in color,
and containing few or no crystals. It is brittle, and splits into
sharp-edged or pointed fragments, which were used by primitive peoples
for arrow-heads, knives and other cutting implements. The ancient
Mexicans used bits of it for shaving purposes, it having an edge of
razor-like sharpness. They also used it as the cutting part of their
weapons of war.



CHAPTER XX.

The Active Volcanoes of the Earth.


It is not by any means an easy task to frame an estimate of the number
of volcanoes in the world. Volcanoes vary greatly in their dimensions,
from vast mountain masses, rising to a height of nearly 25,000 feet
above sea-level, to mere molehills. They likewise exhibit every possible
stage of development and decay: while some are in a state of chronic
active eruption, others are reduced to the condition of solfataras, or
vents emitting acid vapors, and others again have fallen into a more or
less complete state of ruin through the action of denuding forces.


NUMBER OF ACTIVE VOLCANOES


Even if we confine our attention to the larger volcanoes, which merit
the name of mountains, and such of these as we have reason to believe to
be in a still active condition, our difficulties will be diminished, but
not by any means removed. Volcanoes may sink into a dormant condition
that at times endures for hundreds or even thousands of years, and
then burst forth into a state of renewed activity; and it is quite
impossible, in many cases, to distinguish between the conditions of
dormancy and extinction.

We shall, however, probably be within the limits of truth in stating
that the number of great habitual volcanic vents upon the globe which
we have reason to believe are still in active condition, is somewhere
between 300 and 350. Most of these are marked by more or less
considerable mountains, composed of the materials ejected from them.
But if we include mountains which exhibit the external conical form,
crater-like hollows, and other features of volcanoes, yet concerning the
activity of which we have no record or tradition, the number will fall
little, if anything, short of 1,000.

The mountains composed of volcanic materials, but which have lost
through denudation the external form of volcanoes, are still more
numerous, and the smaller temporary openings which are usually
subordinate to the habitual vents that have been active during the
periods covered by history and tradition, must be numbered by thousands.
There are still feebler manifestations of the volcanic forces--such as
steam-jets, geysers, thermal and mineral waters, spouting saline and
muddy springs, and mud volcanoes--that may be reckoned by millions.
It is not improbable that these less powerful manifestations of the
volcanic forces to a great extent make up in number what they want in
individual energy; and the relief which they afford to the imprisoned
activities within the earth's crust may be almost equal to that which
results from the occasional outbursts at the great habitual volcanic
vents.

In taking a general survey of the volcanic phenomena of the globe,
no facts come out more strikingly than that of the very unequal
distribution, both of the great volcanoes, and of the minor exhibitions
of subterranean energy.

Thus, on the whole of the continent of Europe, there is but one habitual
volcanic vent--that of Vesuvius--and this is situated upon the shores of
the Mediterranean. In the islands of that sea, however there are no
less than six volcanoes: namely, Stromboli, and Vulcano, in the Lipari
Islands; Etna, in Sicily; Graham's Isle, a submarine volcano, off the
Sicilian coast; and Santorin and Nisyros, in the Aegean Sea.

The African continent is at present known to contain about ten active
volcanoes--four on the west coast, and six on the east coast, while
about ten other active volcanoes occur on islands close to the African
coasts. On the continent of Asia, more than twenty active volcanoes
are known or believed to exist, but no less than twelve of these are
situated in the peninsula of Kamchatka. No volcanoes are known to exist
in the Australian continent.

The American continent contains a greater number of volcanoes than
the continents of the Old World. There are twenty in North America,
twenty-five in Central America, and thirty-seven in South America. Thus,
taken altogether, there are about one hundred and seventeen volcanoes
situated on the great continental lands of the globe, while nearly twice
as many occur upon the islands scattered over the various oceans.


ASIATIC INLAND VOLCANOES


Upon examining further into the distribution of the continental
volcanoes, another very interesting fact presents itself. The volcanoes
are in almost every instance situated either close to the coasts of the
continent, or at no great distance from them. There are, indeed, only
two exceptions to this rule. In the great and almost wholly unexplored
table-land lying between Siberia and Tibet four volcanoes are said to
exist, and in the Chinese province of Manchuria several others. More
reliable information is, however, needed concerning these volcanoes.

It is a remarkable circumstance that all the oceanic islands which
are not coral-reefs are composed of volcanic rocks; and many of
these oceanic islands, as well as others lying near the shores of the
continents, contain active volcanoes.

Through the midst of the Atlantic Ocean runs a ridge, which, by the
soundings of the various exploring vessels sent out in recent years, has
been shown to divide the ocean longitudinally into two basins. Upon this
great ridge, and the spurs proceeding from it, rise numerous mountainous
masses, which constitute the well-known Atlantic islands and groups
of islands. All of these are of volcanic origin, and among them are
numerous active volcanoes. The Island of Jan Mayen contains an active
volcano, and Iceland contains thirteen, and not improbably more; the
Azores have six active volcanoes, the Canaries three; while about eight
volcanoes lie off the west coast of Africa. In the West Indies there are
six active volcanoes; and three submarine volcanoes have been recorded
within the limits of the Atlantic Ocean. Altogether, no less than forty
active volcanoes are situated upon the great submarine ridges which
traverse the Atlantic longitudinally.

But along the same line the number of extinct volcanoes is far greater,
and there are not wanting proofs that the volcanoes which are still
active are approaching the condition of extinction.


VOLCANOES OF THE PACIFIC


If the great medial chain of the Atlantic presents us with an example of
a chain of volcanic mountains verging on extinction, we have in the
line of islands separating the Pacific and Indian Oceans an example of a
similar range of volcanic vents which are in a condition of the
greatest activity. In the peninsula of Kamchatka there are twelve active
volcanoes, in the Aleutian Islands thirty-one, and in the peninsula
of Alaska three. The chain of the Kuriles contains at least ten active
volcanoes; the Japanese Islands and the islands to the south of Japan
twenty-five. The great group of islands lying to the south-east of the
Asiatic continent is at the present time the grandest focus of volcanic
activity upon the globe. No less than fifty active volcanoes occur here.

Farther south, the same chain is probably continued by the four active
volcanoes of New Guinea, one or more submarine volcanoes, and several
vents in New Britain, the Solomon Isles, and the New Hebrides, the three
active volcanoes of New Zealand, and possibly by Mount Erebus and Mount
Terror in the Antarctic region. Altogether, no less than 150 active
volcanoes exist in the chain of islands which stretch from Behring's
Straits down to the Antarctic circle; and if we include the volcanoes
on Indian and Pacific Islands which appear to be situated on lines
branching from this particular band, we shall not be wrong in the
assertion that this great system of volcanic mountains includes at least
one half of the habitually active vents of the globe. In addition to
the active vents, there are here several hundred very perfect volcanic
cones, many of which appear to have recently become extinct, though some
of them may be merely dormant, biding their time.

A third series of volcanoes starts from the neighborhood of Behring's
Straits, and stretches along the whole western coast of the American
continent. This is much less continuous, but nevertheless very
important, and contains, with its branches, nearly a hundred active
volcanoes. On the north this great band is almost united with the one
we have already described by the chain of the Aleutian and Alaska
volcanoes. In British Columbia about the parallel of 60 degrees N. there
exist a number of volcanic mountains, one of which, Mount St. Elias, is
believed to be 18,000 feet in height. Farther south, in the territory of
the United States, a number of grand volcanic mountains exist, some of
which are probably still active, for geysers and other manifestations of
volcanic activity abound. From the southern extremity of the peninsula
of California an almost continuous chain of volcanoes stretches through
Mexico and Guatemala, and from this part of the volcanic band a branch
is given off which passes through the West Indies, and contains the
volcanoes which have so recently given evidence of their vital activity.

In South America the line is continued by the active volcanoes of
Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile, but at many intermediate points in the chain
of the Andes extinct volcanoes occur, which to a great extent fill up
the gaps in the series. A small offshoot to the westward passes through
the Galapagos Islands. The great band of volcanoes which stretches
through the American continent is second only in importance, and in the
activity of its vents, to the band which divides the Pacific from the
Indian Ocean.

The third volcanic band of the globe is that, already spoken of,
which traverses the Atlantic Ocean from north to south. This series of
volcanic mountains is much more broken and interrupted than the other
two, and a greater proportion of its vents are extinct. It attained its
condition of maximum activity during the distant period of the Miocene,
and now appears to be passing into a state of gradual extinction.

Beginning in the north with the volcanic rocks of Greenland and Bear
Island, we pass southwards, by way of Jan Mayen, Iceland and the Faroe
Islands, to the Hebrides and the north of Ireland. Thence, by way of
the Azores, the Canaries and the Cape de Verde Islands, with some active
vents, we pass to the ruined volcanoes of St. Paul, Fernando de Noronha,
Ascension, St. Helena, Trinidad and Tristan da Cunha. From this great
Atlantic band two branches proceed to the eastward, one through Central
Europe, where all the vents are now extinct, and the other through the
Mediterranean to Asia Minor, the great majority of the volcanoes along
the latter line being now extinct, though a few are still active. The
volcanoes on the eastern coast of Africa may be regarded as situated on
another branch from this Atlantic volcanic band. The number of active
volcanoes on this Atlantic band and its branches, exclusive of those in
the West Indies, does not exceed fifty.


THIAN SHAN AND HAWAIIAN VOLCANOES


From what has been said, it will be seen that the volcanoes of the globe
not only usually assume a linear arrangement, but nearly the whole of
them can be shown to be thrown up along three well-marked bands and the
branches proceeding from them. The first and most important of these
bands is nearly 10,000 miles in length, and with its branches contains
more than 150 active volcanoes; the second is 8,000 miles in length, and
includes about 100 active volcanoes; the third is much more broken and
interrupted, extends to a length of nearly 1,000 miles, and contains
about 50 active vents. The volcanoes of the eastern coast of Africa,
with Mauritius, Bourbon, Rodriguez, and the vents along the line of the
Red Sea, may be regarded as forming a fourth and subordinate band.

Thus we see that the surface of the globe is covered by a network of
volcanic bands, all of which traverse it in sinuous lines with a general
north-and-south direction, giving off branches which often run for
hundreds of miles, and sometimes appear to form a connection between the
great bands.

To this rule of the linear arrangement of the volcanic vents of the
globe, and their accumulation along certain well-marked bands, there are
two very striking exceptions, which we must now proceed to notice.

In the very centre of the continent formed by Europe and Asia, the
largest unbroken land-mass of the globe, there rises from the great
central plateau the remarkable volcanoes of the Thian Shan Range. The
existence of these volcanoes, of which only obscure traditional accounts
had reached Europe before the year 1858, appears to be completely
established by the researches of recent Russian and Swedish travelers.
Three volcanic vents appear to exist in this region, and other volcanic
phenomena have been stated to occur in the great plateau of Central
Asia, but the existence of the latter appears to rest on very doubtful
evidence. The only accounts which we have of the eruptions of these
Thian Shan volcanoes are contained in Chinese histories and treatises on
geography.

The second exceptionally situated volcanic group is that of the Hawaiian
Islands. While the Thian Shan volcanoes rise in the centre of the
largest unbroken land-mass, and stand on the edge of the loftiest and
greatest plateau in the world, the volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands
rise in the northern centre of the largest ocean and from almost the
greatest depths in that ocean. All round the Hawaiian Islands the
sea has a depth of from 2,000 to 3,000 fathoms, and the island-group
culminates in several volcanic cones, which rise to the height of nearly
14,000 feet above the sea-level. The volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands
are unsurpassed in height and bulk by those of any other part of the
globe.

With the exception of the two isolated groups of the Thian Shan and
the Hawaiian Islands, nearly all the active volcanoes of the globe are
situated near the limits which separate the great land-and-water-masses
of the globe--that is to say, they occur either on the parts of
continents not far removed from their coast-lines, or on islands in
the ocean not very far distant from the shores. The fact of the general
proximity of volcanoes to the sea is one which has frequently been
pointed out by geographers, and may now be regarded as being thoroughly
established.


VOLCANOES PARALLEL TO MOUNTAIN CHAINS


Many of the grandest mountain-chains have bands of volcanoes
lying parallel to them. This is strikingly exhibited by the great
mountain-masses which lie on the western side of the American continent.
The Rocky Mountains and the Andes consist of folded and crumpled masses
of altered strata which, by the action of denuding forces, have been
carved into series of ridges and summits. At many points, however, along
the sides of these great chains we find that fissures have been opened
and lines of volcanoes formed, from which enormous quantities of lava
have flowed and covered great tracts of country.

This is especially marked in the Snake River plain of Idaho, in the
western United States. In this, and the adjoining regions of Oregon and
Washington, an enormous tract of country has been overflowed by lava in
a late geological period, the surface covered being estimated to have a
larger area than France and Great Britain combined. The Snake River cuts
through it in a series of picturesque gorges and rapids, enabling us to
estimate its thickness, which is considered to average 4000 feet. Looked
at from any point on its surface, one of these lava-plains appears as a
vast level surface, like that of a lake bottom. This uniformity has been
produced either by the lava rolling over a plain or lake bottom, or by
the complete effacement of an original, undulating contour of the ground
under hundreds or thousands of feet of lava in successive sheets.
The lava, rolling up to the base of the mountains, has followed
the sinuosities of their margin, as the waters of a lake follow its
promontories and bays. Similar conditions exist along the Sierra Nevada
range of California, and to some extent placer mining has gone on under
immense beds of lava, by a process of tunneling beneath the volcanic
rock.

In some localities the volcanoes are of such height and dimensions as
to overlook and dwarf the mountain-ranges by the side of which they lie.
Some of the volcanoes lying parallel to the great American axis appear
to be quite extinct, while others are in full activity. In the Eastern
continent we find still more striking examples of parallelism between
great mountain-chains and the lands along which volcanic activity is
exhibited--volcanoes, active or extinct, following the line of the great
east and west chains which extend through southern Europe and Asia.
There are some other volcanic bands which exhibit a similar parallelism
with mountain chains; but, on the other hand, there are volcanoes
between which and the nearest mountain-axis no such connection can be
traced.


AREAS OF UPHEAVAL AND SUBSIDENCE


There is one other fact concerning the mode of distribution of volcanoes
upon the surface of the globe, to which we must allude. By a study
of the evidences presented by coral-reefs, raised beaches, submerged
forests, and other phenomena of a similar kind, it can be shown that
certain wide areas of the land and of the ocean-floor are at the present
time in a state of subsidence, while other equally large areas are
being upheaved. And the observations of the geologist prove that similar
upward and downward movements of portions of the earth's crust have been
going on through all geological times.

Now, as Mr. Darwin has so well shown in his work on "Coral Reefs," if we
trace upon a map the areas of the earth's surface which are undergoing
upheaval and subsidence respectively, we shall find that nearly all the
active volcanoes of the globe are situated upon rising areas and that
volcanic phenomena are conspicuously absent from those parts of the
earth's crust which can be proved at the present day to be undergoing
depression.

The remarkable linear arrangement of volcanic vents has a significance
that is well worthy of fuller consideration. There are facts known which
point to the cause of this state of affairs. It is not uncommon for
small cones of scoriae to be seen following lines on the flanks or at
the base of a great volcanic mountain. These are undoubtedly lines of
fissure, caused by the subterranean forces. In fact, such fissures have
been seen opening on the sides of Mount Etna, in whose bottom could
be seen the glowing lava. Along these fissures, in a few days, scoriae
cones appeared; on one occasion no less than thirty-six in number.

It is believed by geologists that the linear systems of volcanoes are
ranged along similar lines of fissure in the earth's crust--enormous
breaks, extending for thousands of miles, and the result of internal
energies acting through vast periods of time. Along these immense
fissures in the earth's rock-crust there appear, in place of small
scoriae cones, great volcanoes, built up through the ages by a series of
powerful eruptions, and only ceasing to spout fire themselves when the
portion of the great crack upon which they lie is closed. The greatest
of these fissures is that along the vast sinuous band of volcanoes
extending from near the Arctic circle at Behring's Straits to the
Antarctic circle at South Victoria Land, not far from half round the
earth. It doubtless marks the line of mighty forces which have been
active for millions of years.



CHAPTER XXI.

The Famous Vesuvius and the Destruction of Pompeii.


The famous volcano of southern Italy named Vesuvius, which is now so
constantly in eruption, was described by the ancients as a cone-shaped
mountain with a flat top, on which was a deep circular valley filled
with vines and grass, and surrounded by high precipices. A large
population lived on the sides of the mountain, which was covered with
beautiful woods, and there were fine flourishing cities at its foot. So
little was the terrible nature of the valley on the top understood, that
in A. D. 72, Spartacus, a rebellious Roman gladiator, encamped there
with some thousands of fighting men, and the Roman soldiers were let
down the precipices in order to surprise and capture them.

There had been earthquakes around the mountain, and one of the cities
had been nearly destroyed; but no one was prepared for what occurred
seven years after the defeat of Spartacus. Suddenly, in the year 79
A. D., a terrific rush of smoke, steam, and fire belched from the
mountain's summit; one side of the valley in which Spartacus had
encamped was blown off, and its rocks, with vast quantities of ashes,
burning stones, and sand, were ejected far into the sky. They then
spread out like a vast pall, and fell far and wide. For eight days
and nights this went on, and the enormous quantity of steam sent up,
together with the deluge of rain that fell, produced torrents on the
mountain-side, which, carrying onward the fallen ashes, overwhelmed
everything in their way. Sulphurous vapors filled the air and violent
tremblings of the earth were constant.

A city six miles off was speedily rendered uninhabitable, and was
destroyed by the falling stones; but two others--Herculaneum and
Pompeii--which already had suffered from the down-pour of ashes, were
gradually filled with a flood of water, sand, and ashes, which came down
the side of the volcano, and covering them entirely.


BURIED CITIES EXCAVATED.


The difference in ease of excavation is due to the following
circumstance. Herculaneum being several miles nearer the crater,
