go, so I'll easily find my way. But I'll make use of you some day, for
you are a splendid sentinel."

When the doctor on his return found him still on the same spot, he called
him a pillar of good order and told him that he would send for him if he
should ever need a reliable watchman.

Soon after, Lippo uttered sudden shouts of joy, for he saw his mother
coming downstairs. What a surprise it was to see her when they had
thought that she would be shut up for one or two days longer!

"Mama is coming! Mama is coming!"

All had heard his exclamations and Mea was the first to appear, pulling
Loneli after her. Bruno came rushing from one side and Kurt from the
other, and Maezli shot like an arrow right into their midst. The mother
found herself solidly surrounded.

"Mama, just think--"

"Oh, listen, mama!"

"Oh, mama, I want to tell you--"

"Do you know, mama?"

This came from all sides and all at once.

"To-morrow, children, to-morrow," said the mother. "We must be very
happy that we can see each other so soon again. I wanted to send one of
you to Apollonie, but I am glad to see you here, Loneli."

Mrs. Maxa now told Loneli the message she was to take to her
grandmother. The doctor had just been there and had found Leonore much
better already. As her fever had gone down, he feared no serious
illness. Leonore was to spend several more days in bed and therefore she
was to have a nurse who could also take care of her at night-time. For
this nobody better than grandmother Apollonie could be found, and Mrs.
Maxa would be so glad for her patient's and her own sake if she could
arrange to come to the house for several days and nights. She told
Loneli to tell her grandmother that the little girl was named Leonore and
that Mrs. Maxa was quite sure she would not be hard to take care of.

The mother would not allow herself to be detained any longer. To all the
questions which stormed in upon her she only had one answer: "To-morrow,
children, to-morrow." Then she disappeared again into the sick room.

"Please tell me what she is like, when you have seen her. I am so
curious," said Loneli, taking leave, and Mea promised to give the
sympathetic Loneli a full report of everything.

Next morning extremely early Apollonie appeared at Mrs. Maxa's house.
As the door was not open yet, she knocked quietly and after a while Kathy
appeared with heavy, sleepy eyes.

"Why should anybody rush about at this early hour," she said a little
angrily. It did not suit her at all that Apollonie should have found out
what a short time she had been astir.

"I begin my day at this hour," said Apollonie, "and there is no need for
me to rush about. I can leave that to those who get up late. I have
come to take Mrs. Rector's place in the sick room."

"She hasn't even called yet," Kathy flung out.

"So much the better, then I have at least not come too late. I can find
some work everywhere," and with this Apollonie entered the living room
and began to set it in order.

Kathy did not hinder her and, to show her gratitude, attempted to start a
little conversation. But Apollonie was not in the mood for that. She
was solely filled by the question who the sick Leonore was that she was
going to nurse. Could it be possible?

That moment a bell sounded from upstairs, and Apollonie obeyed the call.
Mrs. Maxa, opening the door, let her enter. Wide awake, Leonore was
sitting up in bed. Her thick, curly hair was falling far down below her
shoulders, and her dark, solemn eyes were gazing with surprise at
Apollonie. The latter looked immovably at the little girl, while tears
were coursing down her cheeks.

"Oh, oh," she said, as soon as she was able to control her emotion, "one
does not need to ask where our little Leonore comes from. It seems to me
as if old times had come back again. Yes, she looked exactly like that
when she came to the castle; only she was not quite so pale."

"Leonore," Mrs. Maxa said, "Mrs. Apollonie has known both your father
and mother very well. So I thought that you would like to have her for a
nurse."

"Certainly," Leonore replied happily, while she stretched out her hand in
a friendly manner towards Apollonie. "Won't you tell me everything you
know about them?" Apollonie was only too glad to do that, but in her
agitation she had first to wipe her eyes.

There was no end to the children's enthusiasm when they found that their
mother was to be their own again. The unaccustomed separation had seemed
much longer and harder to bear than they had imagined, but it was all
over now, she was back and would be theirs now for all time to come.

Bruno suggested that they should divide up their mother's time between
them to-day. This would make it possible for all to get her hearing
separately. In all this time a great deal of matter had accumulated
which was crying to be heard. If they were all to talk to her at once,
as had happened several times before, no one would have any satisfaction,
as she might not even be able to understand them. So it was settled that
every child should have their mother alone for an hour, and they were to
take their turns according to age.

"So of course the first hour after school from eleven till twelve belongs
to me," was Bruno's statement.

"From one till two I shall have my turn," Mea cried out. She was
counting on asking her mother so many questions that they might easily
take three hours. She had no communications to make but she was terribly
eager to hear all about Leonore.

"I'll get the time between four and five o'clock," said Kurt. This term
suited him exactly, as he had a secret hope of prolonging it somewhat.
The two little ones were to have the remaining time before supper, and
Kurt thought that they could not have very much to tell, whereas he was
in need of a great deal of advice.

The mother had been quite certain that Bruno in his interview with her
would make a last, desperate effort to escape having to live with the
Knippel boys. What was her surprise when she found that this had been
entirely pushed into the background by his lively sympathy in Salo's
destiny.

Bruno's thoughts were constantly occupied by the thought that his new,
charming friend stood entirely alone in the world. As Salo had no one
who could help him to find a home, Bruno hoped that his mother would be
able to give him some advice. He felt sure that she would gladly do
this, for she loved both children tenderly, as she had formerly loved
their parents.

The boy had been absolutely right when he supposed that Mrs. Maxa would
be glad to help them, but she had to tell Bruno frankly that there was no
advice she was able to give. She had no authority over the children and
could therefore do nothing, as everything depended on Salo's early
completion of his studies so that he could choose an occupation. This
would have to be settled by the gentleman of whom Salo had spoken. He
was probably a relation of their mother's who had undertaken the care of
the children.

Bruno was terribly cast down when he heard this. When his mother did not
give him help and counsel right away, she usually gave him some hope by
saying, "We shall see." As she had not said this to-day, he felt certain
that nothing could be done. But the mother's unhappy face showed to
Bruno that her disability did not come from a lack of sympathy, and that
it pained her very much that she could do nothing.

When Bruno came out of the room he was very silent and sadder than he had
ever been in his life.

Mea, on the contrary, came skipping out from her interview. Her mother
had told her that Leonore was charming, refined and modest, besides being
extremely grateful for every little favor. But what thrilled Mea beyond
everything was that Leonore had repeatedly told her mother how much she
looked forward to meeting her, because the two were of an age. Leonore's
only fear was that Mea might find her rather tiresome. All the girls in
the boarding school had always accused her of that, for she was often
terribly unhappy, and she could not help it. Mea was more eager than
ever now to meet Leonore, for she was already filled with a warm love for
the sick child. She could talk and think of practically nothing but
Leonore.

"I certainly have to make a song about this violent new friendship," Kurt
said in the evening, when Mea had urged more than once, "Oh, mother, I
hope you won't let Leonore go as soon as she can come down and the doctor
says she is well; otherwise we shall barely be able to become
acquainted."

Mea flared like a rocket at her brother's suggestion, crying violently,
"Indeed you won't, Kurt."

"Mea, Mea," the mother admonished her, "I propose to do all I can to keep
Leonore here as long as possible, but--"

"But, Mea, she might be put to flight with fear and never be seen again
if you attack your poor brothers in such a way," Kurt quickly concluded
the mother's sentence.

Mea had to laugh over this speech, which little resembled her mother's
style of talking.

"My dear Kurt," she said, "I am quite able to complete a sentence without
your assistance. I wanted to say that I should not be able to do very
much, because the ladies will take Leonore when it suits them best. I
have to admit, however, that there was some truth in Kurt's reply.
Leonore has such a delicate, refined nature that it might frighten her to
see you carried away by such passion, Mea."

When the doctor came back again in two days he was surprised at the
improved condition of his little patient. "If she was not so very
young," the doctor said to Mrs. Maxa while she accompanied him out of
the room, "I should say that her illness came largely from some hidden
sorrow and inner suffering. She has apparently been able to shake it off
in the good care and affectionate treatment she is getting here. But I
can scarcely believe this of a child."

When Mrs. Maxa asked him how soon Leonore could leave the room and spend
the day with her very active children, he answered, "She can do it from
to-morrow on. Nothing can possibly refresh her more than some lively
playmates."

With this he took his leave. Going downstairs, he met Apollonie, who was
just coming up with a supper-tray laden with delicate dishes for the sick
child.

"That is right," said the doctor; "it gives one an appetite only to look
at it."

"Yes, the poor child eats like a little bird," said Apollonie; "but Mrs.
Rector says that there must be things to choose from in order to tempt
her. How is she getting along, doctor? Do you think she'll get well
again? Isn't she just like a little angel?"

"That is hard for me to say, as I do not know any angels," he said
smiling, "but she might be for all I know. I am sure that she will get
well with careful nursing, and you are sure to see to that, Mrs.
Apollonie. You seem to think that in being given care of the child you
have drawn the big prize in the lottery."

"Indeed I have. I really have," she cried after him.

No event had ever been looked forward to with such great suspense in Mrs.
Maxa's house as the appearance of Leonore. As soon as all the children
were home from school the next morning, their mother fetched her down.
The three older ones were standing expectantly together in a little
group, while the two smaller ones had placed themselves with wide-open
eyes near the door. Leonore, entering, greeted one after the other in
such an engaging, confidential way that she made them feel as if they
were old friends. She loved their mother so much and had been so closely
drawn to her that she was fond of the children before she had even seen
them. This pleased them tremendously, for they had expected Leonore to
be very different from themselves and had been rather afraid of her. As
soon as they saw her, they felt that they might each be special friends
with their charming guest. Leonore found herself surrounded by them all
in a corner of the sofa. As she did not look at all strong yet, the
mother had led her there. Leonore tried to answer all the questions,
listen to all the projects and information which were showered upon her,
while her eyes danced with merriment. These unusual surroundings made
Leonore so happy that her face became quite rosy. Mea had been already
completed in her mind a plan which, if it succeeded, would make it
possible for her to have Leonore to herself sometimes. Since all her
brothers and sisters liked the visitor so much, it was not easy to get
her off alone. If only her mother would sanction the plan! That day Mea
had to set the table, and when lunch time had come, she quickly ran to
her mother to ask her if she might take Apollonie's place in Leonore's
room, and to her great delight she willingly consented. Mea told her she
would only be too glad to wait on Leonore at night if she could but be
with her. Leonore really needed no more special care, and in case of an
emergency Mea could easily run down to fetch her mother.

"Leonore will mean more to you than she will ever realize," the mother
concluded, "and I feel very gratified if you can do something for her,
too."

Mrs. Maxa then informed Apollonie of the new plan, and she felt sure
that the latter would be glad to get home again.

"I do everything in my power for that angel," she exclaimed. "I should
go to live in the desert if only I could procure a home for her."

After dinner she went to Leonore to say good-bye, and the child pressed
her hand most warmly, thanking her for the good care she had received.

"I shall never forget how kind you have been, Apollonie," she said
heartily. "I shall come to see you as soon as I am allowed to go. I
hope that we shall see each other very often."

"Oh, yes, I hope so! Please ask Mrs. Rector to let you come to me as
often as possible," said Apollonie before leaving.

Leonore now told the children that Apollonie had very vividly described
to her the lovely home of her parents and the wonderful life in the
castle. She had said frankly that she would never desire such a fine
home, if only Salo and she could call a little house their own, so the
good-hearted Apollonie had suggested that they might live with her. She
could easily let them have the whole cottage with the exception of a tiny
chamber. She could wait on them, and what more could they desire?
Leonore had felt that this would be better than anything she had dreamed
of, as she could come over to Mrs. Maxa and her children as often as she
pleased. How happy Salo would be if she wrote him about it.

"Yes, you can," Maezli declared. "Her house is a lovely place to live in.
Loneli is there, who does everything one wants her to, and Apollonie
always cooks what one likes best."

Kurt made a little enigmatical remark to Maezli about her greed, but
before she could have it explained to her, the mother turned to Leonore.

"I do not want you to be deluded by this thought, dear child," she said,
"for that might only bring you disappointment. As soon as you are well,
you can walk to Apollonie's cottage and then you will see what a tiny
place it is. The great obstacle of Salo's studies would not be put aside
in that way, either, for he could not join you there for years."

"Oh, I was thinking all the time how lovely it would be to live with
Apollonie! It would be so wonderful--I could live with her there and Salo
could come to us in the holidays till he is through with his studies.
Then we could both settle here in the neighborhood."

Leonore had been counting on this new scheme and she looked up at Mrs.
Maxa as if she longed for her consent. As Mrs. Maxa did not have the
heart to shatter the child's hopes completely, she decided to let the
matter rest for the present. As soon as they could visit Apollonie,
Leonore could judge for herself how impossible the plan was.

Leonore's eyes were usually very sad, but occasionally she would look
quite merry, and it was so that she appeared that evening when the
children were surrounding her on all sides. When each had to tell her so
much and tried to be nearest her, she experienced the feeling that she
had come to a family to which she really belonged. Each of the children
had founded a special relation with Leonore. Bruno saw himself as her
protector and adviser, and as her brother's close friend he meant to keep
an active watch over her. Mea, whose thoughts had been completely
absorbed for days in her new friend, brought her all the warmth of a
heart which craved friendship passionately. Kurt had made it his duty to
cheer up the rather melancholy child as much as was in his power. Lippo,
still filled a little with his post of sentinel, always came close to her
as if he still needed to watch over her. Maezli was of the firm opinion
that she had to entertain the guest, so she would relate fragments of
funny things she knew, passing from one to another. In this way Leonore
got to hear of the Knippel family. The time passed so quickly that loud
laments were heard when the mother announced that it was time for Leonore
to retire. She did not want her strength to be overtaxed on her first
day out of bed.

"We shall have many more days after this when we can be together," she
added. "Let us be glad of that."

"There might not be so many, for I feel quite well already," Leonore said
with a sigh.

Mrs. Maxa smiled.

"We must thank God for that. But you need to get strong, and I hope that
you may find the needed recreation and change here." Then she accompanied
the two girls up to their room at the top of the house. As Mea was to be
Leonore's sole nurse from now on, Mrs. Maxa wanted to reassure herself
that nothing was missing. It was in Mea's nature to endow every new
friend with marvellous qualities. Her imagination was always as active
as her heart, which she gave unreservedly on such occasions.
Unfortunately Mea suffered many disappointments in that way, because on
nearer acquaintance her friends very seldom came up to her expectations.
She always tried hard to hold on to the original image, even if it did
not in the least coincide with what her friends proved to be in reality
and this brought on numberless fights with Kurt, who, with his usual
shrewdness, could not help revealing to her the real state of affairs.
This always disillusioned her finally, for it was hard to deny his
proofs. Whenever another girl woke a passionate love in her, she was
bound to expect something unusual from her.

A week had passed since Leonore had spent her first day as convalescent
among the family. As Mea had the privilege of being in the closest, most
intimate contact with her new friend in the late evening hours, she was
in a state of perfect bliss. Every moment of the day that she was home
she tried to be at Leonore's side and in her walks to and from school
there existed for her no other subject of conversation than Leonore.

It was quite unusual that Kurt had not produced a rhyme about her great
devotion. He had not once said: "Things will be different after a
while." Brother and sister this time were entirely of one opinion about
her: it even seemed as if Kurt himself had caught a touch of the
friendship fever, as he used to call Mea's great devotion.
