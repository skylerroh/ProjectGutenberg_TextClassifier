The tendency in the hexoses and their polyanhydrides to split off one
carbon atom in the oxidised form, throws some light on the furfurane
type of condensation, which is represented in the lignocelluloses. We
are still without any evidence as to the possible transition of the
hexoses to benzenoid compounds. Such transitions would be more easily
explained on the assumption that the celluloses are composed in part of
polyanhydrides of the ketoses.


SPIRITUS AUS CELLULOSE UND HOLZ.

E. SIMONSEN (Ztschr. angew. Chem., 1898, 3).

~PRODUCTION OF ALCOHOL FROM CELLULOSE AND WOOD.~

(pp. 50, 209) This investigation was undertaken with one main object--to
determine the optimum conditions of treatment of wood-cellulose and of
wood itself for conversion into 'fermentable sugar.' The process of
'inversion' or hydrolysis, by digestion with dilute acid at high
temperature, involves the four main factors: pressure (i.e.
temperature), concentration of acid, ratio of liquid to cellulose and
duration of digestion. Each of these was varied in definite gradations,
and the effect measured. The degree of action was measured in terms of
'reducing sugar,' calculated from the results of estimation by Fehling
solution, as 'glucose' per cent. of original cellulose (or wood).

(a) _Cellulose._ [Wood-cellulose obtained by bisulphite
process.]--With a proportion of total liquid to cellulose of 27 : 1, and
using sulphuric acid as the hydrolysing agent, the optimum results were
obtained with acids of 0.45-0.60 p.ct. (H_{2}SO_{4}) and pressures of
6-8 atm. The maximum yield of 'sugar' was 45 p.ct. of the cellulose.

Under the above conditions the maximum of conversion is attained in 2
hours.

Having now regard to the production of a solution of maximum
_concentration_ of dissolved solids, the following conditions were
asertained to fulfil the requirement, and, in fact, may be regarded as
the economic optimum:

     Proportion of total liquid  6 times wt. of cellulose
     Concentration of acid       0.5 p.ct. H_{2}SO_{4}
     Pressure                   10 atm.
     Duration of digestion       1.5 hour

giving a yield of 41 p.ct. 'reducing sugar' calculated to the original
cellulose (dry).

_Alcoholic Fermentation of Neutralised Extract._--The liquors were found
to ferment freely, and on distillation to yield a quantity of alcohol
equal to 70 p.ct. of the theoretical--i.e. on the basis of the numbers
for copper oxide reduction.

(b) _Hydrolytic 'Conversion' of Wood (Lignocellulose)._--A similarly
systematic investigation carried out upon pine sawdust established the
following as optimum conditions:

     Proportion of total liquid  5 times wt. of wood
     Concentration of acid       0.5 p.ct. H_{2}SO_{4}
     Pressure                    9 atm.
     Duration of digestion      15 minutes

giving a yield of 20 p.ct. 'reducing sugar,' calculated from the
'Fehling' test.

_Fermentation_ of the neutralised extracts gave variable results. The
highest yields obtained were 60 p.ct. of theoretical, the author finally
concluding that under properly controlled conditions of inversion and
fermentation 100 kg. wood yield 6.5 l. absolute alcohol.

~ON THE CAUSE OF INCOMPLETE FERMENTATION OF SUGARS OBTAINED BY ACID
HYDROLYSIS OF WOOD.~

The author criticises Simonsen's explanation of the results obtained
with extracts from pine wood. The incompleteness of fermentation of the
products is certainly due in part to the presence of furfural-yielding
carbohydrates, which are resistant to yeast. The pine woods contain 8-10
p.ct. of these constituents in their anhydride form ('pentosanes'). They
yield readily to acid hydrolysis, and certainly constitute a
considerable percentage of the dissolved products. A similar complex was
obtained by the author in his investigation of peat (Berl. Ber. 30,
2571), and was found to be similarly incompletely attacked by yeast. The
yields of alcohol corresponded with the proportion of the total
carbohydrates disappearing. These were the hexose constituents of the
hydrolysed complex, the pentoses (or 'furfuroids') surviving intact.

~WASTE LIQUORS FROM BISULPHITE PROCESS.~

(p. 210) Later researches confirm the conclusion that in the soluble
by-products of these cellulose processes the S is combined as a SO_{3}H
group. The following analyses of the isolated lignin sulphonic acid are
cited:

 ________________________________________________

| (d) Street               | 50.22 | 5.64 | 7.67 |
|__________________________|_______|______|______|

The variations are due to the varying conditions of the digestion of the
wood and to corresponding degrees of sulphonation of the original
lignone group. Calculating the composition of the latter from the above
numbers on the assumption that the S represents SO_{3}H, the following
figures result:

 __________________________________

This author considers that beyond the empirical facts established by the
above named[10] very little is yet known in regard to the constitution
of the lignone complex.

Nor is there any satisfactory application of this by-product as yet
evolved. Evaporation and combustion involve large losses of sulphur
[D.R.P. 74,030, 83,438; Seidel and Hanak, Mitt. Techn. Gew. Mus. 1898].
A more complete regeneration of the sulphur has been the subject of a
series of patents [D.R.P. 40,308, 69,892, 71,942, 78,306, 81,338], but
the processes are inefficient through neglect of the actual state of
combination of the S, viz. as an organic sulphonate. The process of V.B.
Drewson (D.R.P. 67,889) consists in heating with lime under pressure,
yielding calcium monosulphite (with sulphate and the lignone complex in
insoluble form). The sulphite is redissolved as bisulphite by treatment
with sulphurous acid. This process is relatively costly, and yields
necessarily an impure lye. It has been proposed to employ the product as
a foodstuff both in its original form and in the form of benzoate
(D.R.P. 97,935); but its unsuitability is obvious from its composition.
A method of destructive distillation has been patented (D.R.P. 45,951).
The author has investigated the process, and finds that the yield of
useful products is much too low for its economical development. Fusion
with alkaline hydrates for the production of oxalic acid (D.R.P. 52,491)
is also excluded by the low yield of the product.

The application of the liquor for tanning purposes (D.R.P. 72,161)
appears promising from the fact that 28 p.ct. of the dry residue is
removed by digestion with hide powder. This application has been
extensively investigated, but without practical success. Various
probable uses are suggested by the viscosity of the evaporated extract.
As a substitute for glue in joinery work, bookbinding, &c., it has
proved of little value. It is applied to some extent as a binding
material in the manufacture of briquettes, also as a substitute for
gelatin in the petroleum industry. Cross and Bevan (E.P. 1548/1883) and
Mitscherlich (D.R.P. 93,944 and 93,945) precipitate a compound of the
lignone complex and gelatin by adding a solution of the latter to the
liquors. The compound is redissolved in weak alkaline solutions and
employed in this form for engine-sizing papers. Ekman has patented a
process (D.R.P. 81,643) for 'salting out' the lignone sulphonates, the
product being resoluble in water and the solution having some of the
properties of a solution of dextrin. Owing to its active chemical
properties this product--'dextron'--has a limited capability of
substituting dextrin. The suggestion to employ the evaporated extract as
a reducing agent in indigo dyeing and printing has also proved
unfruitful. The author's application of the soda salt of the lignone
sulphonic acid as a reducing agent in chrome-mordanting wool and woollen
goods (D.R.P. 99,682) is more successful in practice, and its industrial
development shows satisfactory progress. The product is known as
'lignorosin.'

~INVESTIGATIONS OF PECTINS.~

(p. 216) It is generally held that the pectins are, or contain, oxidised
derivatives of the carbohydrates. The authors have isolated and analysed
a series of these products, and the results fail to confirm a high
ratio O : H. The following are the analytical numbers:

Acid hydrolysis (4 p.ct. H_{2}SO_{4}) gave syrupy products not
crystallisable--in certain cases the hydrolysis was accompanied by
separation of insoluble cellulose. The insoluble product from currant
pectin had the composition C 54.4, H 5.0.

Tollens points out that the results of empirical analysis are
inconclusive; and that from the acid reactions of these products and
their combination with bases, carboxylic groups are present, though
probably in anhydride or ester form.

The pectins may be regarded as closely related to the mucilages
(_Pflanzenschleim_), differing from them only by the presence of the
oxidised groups in question.

~CONSTITUTION OF PECTINS.~

It is pointed out that the composition of the pectin of white currants,
as given in the preceding paper, is that of the typical lignocellulose,
the jute fibre. The product was isolated and further investigated by the
author. It gave 9.8 p.ct. furfural on boiling with HCl (1.06 s.g.),
reacted freely with chlorine, giving quinone chlorides, and with ferric
ferricyanide to form Prussian blue. This 'pectin' is therefore a form
of soluble lignocellulose. The 'pectic' group consequently must be
extended to include hydrated and soluble forms of the mixed complex of
condensed and unsaturated groups with normal carbohydrates, such as
constitute the fibrous lignocelluloses.


UEBER DAS PFLANZLICHE AMYLOID.

E. WINTERSTEIN (Ztschr. Physiol. Chem., 1892, 353).

~ON VEGETABLE AMYLOID.~

(p. 224) A group of constituents of many seeds, distinguished by giving
slimy or ropy 'solutions' under the action of boiling water are
designated 'amyloid.' They are reserve materials, and in this, as in the
physical properties of their 'solutions,' they are very similar to
starch. They are, however, not affected by diastase; and generally are
more resistant to hydrolysis. Typical amyloids have been isolated by the
author from seeds of _Tropoeolum majus, Poeonia officinalis_, and
_Impatiens Balsamina_. The raw material was carefully purified by
exhaustive treatment with ether and alcohol, &c.; the amyloid then
extracted by boiling with water, and isolated by precipitation with
alcohol. Elementary analysis gave the numbers C 43.2, H 6.1. On boiling
with 12 p.ct. HCl it gave 15.3 p.ct. furfural; oxidised with nitric acid
it yielded 10.4 p.ct. mucic acid. Specimens from the two first-named raw
materials gave almost identical numbers.

_Hydrolysis._--On boiling with dilute acids these products are gradually
broken down, dissolving without residue. In this respect they are
differentiated from the mucilages, which give a residue of cellulose
(insoluble). From the solution the author isolated crystalline
galactose, but failed to isolate a pentose. Dextrose was also not
identified directly.

The tissue residues left after extracting the amyloid constituent, as
above described, were subjected to acid hydrolysis. A complex of
products was obtained, from which galactose was isolated. A
furfural-yielding carbohydrate was also present in some quantity, but
could not be isolated. The original seed tissues, therefore, contain an
amyloid and a hemicellulose, the latter differentiated in its resistance
to water. Both yield, however, to acid hydrolysis a complex of products
of similar composition and constitution.

~CARBOHYDRATE CONSTITUENTS OF PEAT.~

showed increasing percentage of carbon, and inversely a decreasing yield

cuspidatum_--with C = 49.80 p.ct., and furfural 7.99 p.ct., calculated
to dry, ash-free substance:

fermenting away the hexoses, the residue was treated with
phenylhydrazine and an osazone separated. It contained 17.3 p.ct. N, but
melted at 130 deg.. The substance could not be identified as an osazone of
any of the yet known pentoses.




SECTION VIII. INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL. GENERAL REVIEW


~The Industrial Uses of Cellulose.~

C. F. CROSS (Cantor Lectures, Soc. of Arts, 1897).

(p. 273) A series of three lectures, in which the more important
industries in cellulose and its derivatives are dealt with on their
scientific foundations, and by means of a selection of typical problems.
In reference to textiles, the small number of vegetable fibres actually
available, out of the endless variety afforded by the plant world, is
referred to the number of conditions required to be fulfilled by the
individual fibre, thus: yield per cent. of harvested weight or per unit
of field area, ease of extraction, the absolute dimensions of the
spinning unit, and the proportion of variation from the mean dimensions;
the relative facility with which the unit fibre can be isolated
preparatory to the final twisting operation; the chemical constants of
the fibre substance, especially the percentage of cellulose and degree
of resistance to hydrolysis. It is suggested that any important addition
to the very limited number fulfilling the conditions, or any great
improvement in these, can only result from very elaborate artificial
selection and cultural developments on this basis.

The paper making fibres are shown to fall into a scheme of
classification based on chemical constitution, and consisting of the
four groups: (a) Cotton [flax, hemp, rhea], (b) wood celluloses,
