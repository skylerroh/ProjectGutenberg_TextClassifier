    Hallelujah! let the word
      Echo round the earth and main.

2   Hallelujah!--hark! the sound,
      Heard through earth, and through the skies,
    Wakes above, beneath, around,
      All creation's harmonies:
    See Jehovah's banner furled,
      Sheathed his sword; he speaks,--'t is done!
    And the kingdoms of this world
      Are the kingdoms of his Son.

The Progress of the Gospel.


1   See how great a flame aspires,
      Kindled by a spark of grace!
    Jesus' love the nations fires,
      Sets the kingdoms on a blaze.
    To bring fire on earth he came:
      Kindled in some hearts it is:
    O that all might catch the flame,
      All partake the glorious bliss!

2   When he first the work begun,
      Small and feeble was his day:
    Now the word doth swiftly run,
      Now it wins its widening way:
    More and more it spreads and grows,
      Ever mighty to prevail;
    Sin's strong-holds it now o'erthrows,
      Shakes the trembling gates of hell.

3   Saw ye not the cloud arise,
      Little as a human hand?
    Now it spreads along the skies,
      Hangs o'er all the thirsty land!
    Lo! the promise of a shower
      Drops already from above!
    Haste, O Lord, and quickly pour
      All the spirit of thy love.

1   Thou, whose wide extended sway

    Thou, our Guardian and our Stay,
        Evermore adored:
    In prospective, Lord, we see
    Jew and Gentile, bond and free,
    Reconciled in Christ to thee,
        Holy, holy Lord.

2   Thou by all shalt be confessed,
    Ever blessing, ever blest,
    When to thy eternal rest,
        In the courts above,
    Thou shall bring the sore oppressed;
    Fill each joy-desiring breast;
    Make of each a welcome guest,
        At the feast of love.

3   When destroying death shall die,
    Hushed be every rising sigh,
    Tears be wiped from every eye,
        Never more to fall;
    Then shall praises fill the sky,
    And angelic hosts shall cry,
    Holy, Holy Lord, Most High,
        Thou art all in all!

    Make thy great salvation known.

2   Then shall God, with lavish hand,
    Scatter blessings o'er the land;
    Earth shall yield her rich increase,
    Every breeze shall whisper peace,
    And the world's remotest bound
    With the voice of praise resound.

    His banner of love in its glory waves o'er us;
      That love will continue forever the same.
        Sound the full chorus, &c.

2   Praise to Jehovah! Give praise--let it rise
    From earth, in its fulness--and swell to the skies!
    Give glory and praise! For a ransomed creation
      The gospel of peace in its triumph shall see;
    Our God hath redeemed us--and Christ our salvation
      Appears, from transgression and death to make free!

      Though earth and hell should dare oppose;
    The stone cut from the mountain's side,
      To universal empire grows.

3   Afric's emancipated sons
      Shall shout to Asia's rapt'rous song,
    Europe, with her unnumbered tongues,
      And western climes the strain prolong.

4   From east to west, from north to south,
      Immanuel's kingdom shall extend,
    And every man, in every face,
      Shall meet a brother and a friend.

Reign of Christ.  Isa. 35.


1   The radiant dawn of gospel light,
    The prophet saw in vision bright,
      And hailed th' auspicious day,
    When Christ should all his grace disclose
    And cure the world of all its woes,
      By truth's triumphant sway.

2   The blind their eyes shall open wide;
    To drink the light's o'erflowing tide,
      The deaf sweet music hear;
    The lame like bounding hart shall leap;
    The dumb no longer silence keep,
      But shout redemption near.

3   And there shall be a holy way,
    In which the simple shall not stray--
      The path so plain and bright.
    Wayfaring men therein shall walk,
    And of their home and kindred talk,
      With rapture and delight.

4   No ravenous beast in quest of prey,
    No lion lurking in the way,
      Shall ever there be seen.
    The place where dragons lay concealed,
    Large crops of waving grass shall yield,
      With reeds and rushes green.

5   And when to Zion's peaceful home
    The ransomed of the Lord shall come,
      (O haste the blissful day!)
    Glad strains shall every tongue employ
    In songs of everlasting joy,
      And sighing flee away.

1   Amazing, beauteous change!
      A world created new!
    My thoughts with transport range,
      The lovely scene to view:
        In all I trace,
          The work is thine;
          Saviour divine,
        Be thine the praise!

2   See crystal fountains play
      Amidst the burning sands;
    The river's winding way
      Shines through the thirsty lands;
        New grass is seen,
          Its carpet spreads
          And o'er the meads
        Of living green.

3   Where pointed brambles grew,
      Entwined with horrid thorn,
    Gay flowers, forever new,
      The painted fields adorn;
        The blushing rose,
          In union fair,
          And lily there,
        Their sweets disclose.

4   The tyrants of the plain
      Their savage chase give o'er;
    No more they rend the slain.
      And thirst for blood no more;
        But infant hands
          And lions yoke
          Fierce tigers stroke,
        In flowery bands.

5   O, when, Almighty Lord,
      Shall these glad scenes arise,
    To verify thy word,
      And bless our wondering eyes?
        That earth may raise,
          United songs
          With all its tongues,
        Of ardent praise.

    From their blood-stained altars hurled.

2   Yet the promise stands securely,
      And Messiah's reign shall spread;
    Not in vain his glorious conquest;
      Not in vain the Saviour bled.
          Chief immortal!
    God's own hand hath crowned thy head.

    Prepare thy most harmonious strains
      Glad hallelujahs to prolong.

2   Tremble, ye pageants of a day,
    Formed, like your slaves, of brittle clay!
      Down to the dust your sceptres bend;
    To everlasting years He reigns,
    And undiminished state maintains,
      When kings, and suns, and time shall end.

3   So shall his favored Zion live:
    In vain confed'rate nations strive
      Her sacred turrets to destroy;
    Her Sov'reign sits enthroned above,
    And endless power and endless love
      Ensure her safety and her joy.

      In peace by all who come;
    And every wind that blows, shall waft
      Some long-lost wand'rer home.

    Who mercy, through their fall, obtain,
    And Christ, by their rejection, gain.

2   But hast thou finally forsook,
      Forever cast thine own away?
    Wilt thou not bid the murderers look
      On Him they pierced, and weep and pray?
    Yes! gracious Lord, thy word is past--
    "All Israel shall be saved at last."

3   Come, then, thou great Deliverer, come!
      The veil from Jacob's heart remove:
    Receive thine ancient people home,
      That, quickened by thy dying love,
    In their recovery we may find
    Life from the dead for all mankind.

    And the joyous song awakes,

Prayer for Mercy in Spiritual Need.


1   Lord, have mercy when we pray
    Strength to seek a better way;
    When our wakening thoughts begin
    First to loathe their cherished sin;
    When our weary spirits fail,
    And our aching brows are pale;
    When our tears bedew thy word;
    Then, O then, have mercy, Lord.

2   Lord, have mercy when we lie
    On the restless bed and sigh,--
    Sigh for death, yet fear it still;
    From the thought of former ill;
    When the dim, advancing gloom
    Tells us that our hour is come;
    When is loosed the silver cord;
    Then, O then, have mercy, Lord.

3   Lord, have mercy, when we know
    First how vain this world below:
    When its darker thoughts oppress,
    Doubts perplex, and fears distress;
    When the earliest gleam is given
    Of the bright but distant heaven;
    Then thy fostering grace afford;
    Then, O then, have mercy, Lord.

    Reviews his wanderings with surprise;
      His heart begins to break.

2   "I starve," he cries, "nor can I bear
      The famine in this land,
    While servants of my Father share
      The bounty of his hand.

3   "With deep repentance I'll return
      And seek my Father's face;
    Unworthy to be called a son,
      I'll ask a servant's place."

4   Far off the Father saw him move,
      In pensive silence mourn,
    And quickly ran with arms of love,
      To welcome his return.

5   O, let thy boundless mercy shine
      On my benighted soul,
    Correct my passions, mend my heart,

    Our folly and unsteadfastness:
    When shall these hearts more stable be,
    Fixed by thy grace alone on thee?

      Such pure delight impart.

      Thy mercy, Lord, reveal:
    The broken heart thy love can bind,
      The wounded spirit heal.

4     Thy presence shall restore
      Peace to my anxious breast:
    Lord, let my steps be drawn no more

2   Exposed to want, exposed to harm,
    Far from our gentle Shepherd's arm;
    Nor will these fatal wanderings cease,
    Till thou reveal the paths of peace.

3   O seek thy thoughtless servants, Lord,
    Nor let us quite forget thy word;
    Our erring feet do thou restore,
    And keep us that we stray no more.

Sense of Sin.


1   Jesus demands this heart of mine,
      Demands my love, my joy, my care,
    But ah, how dead to things divine,
      How cold my best affections are!

2   'Tis sin, alas! with dreadful power,
      Divides my Saviour from my sight;
    O, for one happy, shining hour
      Of sacred freedom, sweet delight!

3   Come, gracious Lord; thy love can raise
      My captive powers from sin and death,
    And fill my heart and life with praise,
      And tune my last, expiring breath.

The True Penitent.


1   O sinner! bring not tears alone,
      Or outward form of prayer:
    But let it in thy heart be known
      That penitence is there.

2   To beat the breast, the clothes to rend,
      God asketh not of thee:
    Thy secret soul he bids thee bend
      In true humility.

3   O righteous Judge! if thou wilt deign
      To grant us what we need;
    We pray for time to turn again,
      And grace to turn indeed.

Devout Penitence.


1   My soul before thee prostrate lies;
    To thee, her source, my spirit flies;
    My wants I mourn, my chains I see;
    O let thy presence set me free.

2   In life's short day, let me yet more
    Of thy enlivening power implore;
    My mind must deeper sink in thee,
    My foot stand firm from wandering free.

3   Take full possession of my heart;
    The lowly mind of Christ impart;
    I still will wait, O Lord, on thee,
    Till, in thy light, the light I see.

4   One only care my soul should know,
    Father, all thy commands to do;
    Oh! deep engrave it on my breast,
    That I in thee alone am blest.

Vain Repentance.


1   Times without number have I prayed,
      "This only once forgive;"
    Relapsing when thy hand was stayed,
      And suffered me to live.

2   Yet now the kingdom of thy peace,
      Lord, to my heart restore;
    Forgive my vain repentances,
      And bid me sin no more.

"There is Joy in Heaven over one Sinner that Repenteth."


1   There was joy in heaven!
    There was joy in heaven!
    When this goodly world to frame,
    The Lord of light and mercy came:
    Shouts of joy were heard on high,
    And the stars sang from the sky,
      "Glory to God in heaven!"

2   There was joy in heaven!
    There was joy in heaven!
    When of love the midnight beam
    Dawned on the towers of Bethlehem;
    And along the echoing hill
    Angels sang--"On earth good will,
      And glory in the heaven!"

3   There is joy in heaven!
    There is joy in heaven!
    When the sheep that went astray
    Turns again to virtue's way;
    When the soul by grace subdued
    Sobs its prayer of gratitude,
      Then is there joy in heaven!

Freedom from Error, Guilt and Folly.


1   Blest Instructor! from thy ways
    Who can tell how oft he strays?
    Save from error's growth our mind,
    Leave not, Lord, one root behind.

2   Purge us from the guilt that lies
    Wrapt within our heart's disguise;
    Let us thence, by thee renewed,
    Each presumptuous sin exclude.

3   Let our tongues, from error free,
    Speak the words approved by thee:
    To thine all-observing eyes,
    Let our thoughts accepted rise.

4   While we thus thy name adore,
    And thy healing grace implore,
    Blest Instructor! bow thine ear:
    God our strength! propitious hear.

For Divine Guidance.


1   O God, thy grace impart!
    Revive my fainting heart;
      My zeal inspire;
    Reveal thyself to me,
    And may my love to thee
    Pure, warm, and changeless be,--
      A living fire.

2   While life's dark maze I tread,
    And griefs around me spread,
      Be thou my guide;
    Bid darkness turn to day,
    Wipe sorrow's tears away,
    Nor let me ever stray
      From thee aside.

3   When ends life's transient dream,
    When death's cold sullen stream
      Shall o'er me roll,
    O Father, then in love,
    Fear and distress remove,
    And bear me safe above,--
      A ransomed soul.

Pardon.


1   Soft are the fruitful showers that bring
    The welcome promise of the spring,
      And soft the vernal gale:
    Sweet the wild warblings of the grove,
    The voice of nature and of love,
      That gladden every vale.

2   But softer in the mourner's ear
    Sounds the mild voice of mercy near,
      That whispers sins forgiven;
    And sweeter far the music swells,
    When to the raptured soul she tells
      Of peace and promised heaven.

3   Fair are the flowers that deck the ground;
    And groves and gardens blooming round,
      Unnumbered charms unfold:
    Bright is the sun's meridian ray,
    And bright the beams of setting day,
      That robe the clouds in gold.

4   But far more fair the pious breast,
    In richer robes of goodness dressed,
      Where heaven's own graces shine;
    And brighter far the prospects rise,
    That burst on faith's delighted eyes,
      From glories all divine.

Peace after a Storm.


1   When darkness long has veiled my mind,
      And smiling day once more appears,
    Then, my Creator! then I find
      The folly of my doubts and fears.

2   Straight I upbraid my wandering heart,
      And blush that I should ever be
    Thus prone to act so base a part,
      Or harbor one hard thought of thee.

3   O! let me then at length be taught,
      What I am still so slow to learn,--
    That God is love, and changes not,
      Nor knows the shadow of a turn.

4   Sweet truth, and easy to repeat!
      But when my faith is sharply tried,
    I find myself a learner yet,
      Unskilful, weak, and apt to slide.

5   But, O my God! one look from thee
      Subdues the disobedient will,
    Drives doubt and discontent away,
      And thy rebellious child is still.

For a Life devoted to God's Glory.


1   O thou, who hast at thy command
    The hearts of all men in thy hand!
    Our wayward, erring hearts incline
    To have no other will but thine.

2   Our wishes, our desires, control;
    Mould every purpose of the soul;
    O'er all may we victorious be
    That stands between ourselves and thee.

3   Thrice blest will all our blessings be,
    When we can look through them to thee,
    When each glad heart its tribute pays
    Of love, and gratitude, and praise.

4   And while we to thy glory live,
    May we to thee all glory give,
    Until the final summons come,
