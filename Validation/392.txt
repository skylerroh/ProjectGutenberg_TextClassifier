[Illustration: FIG. 3.--The White Pine.]

Value for planting: Aside from its value as an ornamental tree, the
    white pine is an excellent tree to plant on abandoned farms and for
    woodlands and windbreaks throughout the New England States, New
    York, Pennsylvania, and the Lake States.

Commercial value: The wood is easily worked, light, durable, and will
    not warp. It is used for naval construction, lumber, shingles,
    laths, interior finish, wooden ware, etc.

Other characters: The _fruit_ is a cone, four to six inches long.

Comparisons: The tree is apt to be confused with the _Bhotan pine_
    (_Pinus excelsa_), which is commonly grown as an ornamental tree.
    The Bhotan pine, however, has needles much longer and more drooping
    in appearance.


THE PITCH PINE (_Pinus rigida_)

Distinguishing characters: Here there are *three* needles to each
    cluster, Fig. 4. They are dark, yellowish-green needles about four
    inches long. The rough-looking _branches_ of the tree may be seen
    _studded with cones_ throughout the year, and _clusters of leaves_
    may be seen _sprouting directly from the trunk_ of the tree; see
    Fig. 5. The last two are very characteristic and will distinguish
    the tree at a glance.


Form and size: It is a low tree of uncertain habit and extremely rough
    looking at every stage of its life. It is constantly full of dead
    branches and old cones which persist on the tree throughout the
    year.

Range: Eastern United States.

Soil and location: Grows in the poorest and sandiest soils where few
    other trees will grow. In New Jersey and on Long Island where it is
    native, it proves so hardy and persistent that it often forms pure
    stands excluding other trees.

[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Twig of the Pitch Pine.]

Enemies: None of importance.

Value for planting: Well adapted for the sea coast and other exposed
    places. It is of extremely uncertain habit and is subject to the
    loss of the lower limbs. It frequently presents a certain
    picturesqueness of outline, but it could not be used as a specimen
    tree on the lawn.

[Illustration: FIG. 5.--The Pitch Pine.]

Commercial value: The wood is coarse grained and is used for rough
    lumber, fuel, and charcoal.

Other characters: The _fruit_ is a cone one to three
inches long, persistent on the tree for several years.


THE SCOTCH PINE (_Pinus sylvestris_)

Distinguishing characters: There are *two* needles to each cluster, and
    these are _short_ compared with those of the white pine, and
    _slightly twisted_; see Fig. 6. The _bark_, especially along the
    upper portion of the trunk, _is reddish_ in color.

Form and size: A medium-sized tree with a short crown.

Range: Europe, Asia, and eastern United States.

Soil and location: Will do best on a deep, rich, sandy soil, but will
    also grow on a dry, porous soil.

Enemies: In Europe the Scotch pine has several insect enemies, but in
    America it appears to be free from injury.

Value for planting: Suitable for windbreaks and woodland planting. Many
    excellent specimens may also be found in our parks.

Commercial value: In the United States, the wood is chiefly used for
    fuel, though slightly used for barrels, boxes, and carpentry. In
    Europe, the Scotch pine is an important timber tree.

Comparisons: The Scotch pine is apt to be confused with the _Austrian
    pine_ (_Pinus austriaca_), because they both have two needles to
    each cluster. The needles of the Austrian pine, however, are much
    longer, coarser, straighter, and darker than those of the Scotch
    pine; Fig. 1. The form of the Austrian pine, too, is more
    symmetrical and compact.

[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Twig of the Scotch Pine.]

    The _red pine_ (_Pinus resinosa_) is another tree that has two
    needles to each cluster, but these are much longer than those of the
    Scotch pine (five to six inches) and are straighter. The bark, which
    is reddish in color, also differentiates the red pine from the
    Austrian pine. The position of the cones on the red pine, which
    point outward and downward at maturity, will also help to
    distinguish this tree from the Scotch and the Austrian varieties.



GROUP II. THE SPRUCE AND HEMLOCK

How to tell them from other trees: The spruce and hemlock belong to the
    evergreen class and may be told from the other trees by their
    _leaves_. The characteristic leaves of the spruce are shown in Fig.
    9; those of the hemlock in Fig. 10. These are much shorter than the
    needles of the pines but are longer than the leaves of the red cedar
    or arbor vitae. They are neither arranged in clusters like those of
    the larch, nor in feathery layers like those of the cypress. They
    adhere to the tree throughout the year, while the leaves of the
    larch and cypress shed in the fall.

    The spruces are pyramidal-shaped trees, with tall and tapering
    trunks, thickly covered with branches, forming a compact crown. They
    are widely distributed throughout the cold and temperate regions of
    the northern hemisphere, where they often form thick forests over
    extended areas.

    There are eighteen recognized species of spruce. The Norway spruce
    has been chosen as a type for this group because it is so commonly
    planted in the northeastern part of the United States.

    The hemlock is represented by seven species, confined to temperate
    North America, Japan, and Central and Western China.

[Illustration: FIG. 7.--The Norway Spruce.]

How to tell them from each other: The needles and branches of the spruce
    are _coarse_; those of the hemlock are _flat and graceful_. The
    individual leaves of the spruce, Fig. 9, are four-sided and green or
    blue on the under side, while those of the hemlock, Fig. 10, are
    flat and are _marked by two white lines_ on the under side.


THE NORWAY SPRUCE (_Picea excelsa_)

Distinguishing characters: The characteristic appearance of the
    full-grown tree is due to the *drooping branchlets* carried on *main
    branches which bend upward* (Fig. 7).

Leaf: The leaves are dark green in color and are _arranged spirally_,
    thus making the twigs coarser to the touch than the twigs of the
    hemlock or fir. In cross-section, the individual leaflet is
    quadrilateral, while that of the pine is triangular.

Form and size: A large tree with a straight, undivided trunk and a
    well-shaped, conical crown (Fig. 7).

Range: Northern Europe, Asia, northern North America.

Soil and location: Grows in cool, moist situations.

Enemies: The foliage of the spruce is sometimes affected by _red
    spider_, but is apt to be more seriously injured by drought, wind,
    and late frosts.

Value for planting: Commonly planted as an ornamental tree and for
    hedges. It does well for this purpose in a cool northern climate,
    but in the vicinity of New York City and further south it does not
    do as well, losing its lower branches at an early age, and becoming
    generally scraggly in appearance.

[Illustration: FIG. 8.--A Group of Hemlock.]

Commercial value: The wood is light and soft and is used for
    construction timber, paper pulp, and fuel.

Other characters: The _fruit_ is a large slender cone, four to seven
    inches long.

Comparisons: The _white spruce_ (_Picea canadensis_) may be told from
    the Norway spruce by the whitish color on the under side of its
    leaves and the unpleasant, pungent odor emitted from the needles
    when bruised. The cones of the white spruce, about two inches long,
    are shorter than these of the Norway spruce, but are longer than
    those of the black spruce.

    It is essentially a northern tree growing in all sorts of locations
    along the streams and on rocky mountain slopes as far north as the
    Arctic Sea and Alaska. It often appears as an ornamental tree as far
    south as New York and Pennsylvania.

    The _black spruce_ (_Picea mariana_) may be told from the other
    spruces by its small cone, which is usually only about one inch in
    length. In New England it seldom grows to as large a size as the
    other spruce trees.

    It covers large areas in various parts of northern North America and
    grows to its largest size in Manitoba. The black spruce has little
    value as an ornamental tree.

    The _Colorado blue spruce_ (_Picea parryana_ or _Picea pungens_)
    which is commonly used as an ornamental tree on lawns and in parks,
    can be told from the other spruces by its pale-blue or sage-green
    color and its sharp-pointed, coarse-feeling twigs. Its small size
    and sharp-pointed conical form are also characteristic.

    It grows to a large size in Colorado and the Middle West. In the
    Eastern States and in northern Europe where it is planted as an
    ornamental tree, it is usually much smaller.

[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Twig of the Norway Spruce.]


HEMLOCK (_Tsuga canadensis_)

Distinguishing characters: Its leaves are arranged in *flat layers*,
    giving a flat, horizontal and graceful appearance to the whole
    branch (Fig. 8). The individual leaves are dark green above, lighter
    colored below, and are *marked by two white lines on the under side*
    (Fig. 10).

    The leaves are arranged on little stalks, a characteristic that does
    not appear in the other evergreen trees.

Form and size: A large tree with a broad-based pyramidal head, and a
    trunk conspicuously tapering toward the apex. The branches extend
    almost to the ground.

Range: The hemlock is a northern tree, growing in Canada and the United
    States.

Soil and location: Grows on all sorts of soils, in the deepest woods as
    well as on high mountain slopes.

Enemies: None of importance.

Value for planting: The hemlock makes an excellent hedge because it
    retains its lowest branches and will stand shearing. In this respect
    it is preferable to the spruce. It makes a fair tree for the lawn
    and is especially desirable for underplanting in woodlands, where
    the shade from the surrounding trees is heavy. In this respect it is
    like the beech.

Commercial value: The wood is soft, brittle, and coarse-grained, and is
    therefore used mainly for coarse lumber. Its bark is so rich in
    tannin that it forms one of the chief commercial products of the
    tree.

Other characters: The _fruit_ is a small cone about 3/4 of an inch long,
    which generally hangs on the tree all winter.

[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Twig of the Hemlock.]



GROUP III. THE RED CEDAR AND ARBOR-VITAE

How to tell them from other trees: The red cedar (juniper) and
    arbor-vitae may be told from other trees by their _leaves_, which
    remain on the tree and keep green throughout the entire year. These
    leaves differ from those of the other evergreens in being much
    shorter and of a distinctive shape as shown in Figs. 12 and 13. The
    trees themselves are much smaller than the other evergreens
    enumerated in this book. Altogether, there are thirty-five species
    of juniper recognized and four of arbor-vitae. The junipers are
    widely distributed over the northern hemisphere, from the Arctic
    region down to Mexico in the New World, and in northern Africa,
    China, and Japan in the Old World. The arbor-vitae is found in
    northeastern and northwestern America, China, and Japan. The species
    mentioned here are those commonly found in America.

How to tell them from each other: The _twigs_ of the arbor-vitae are
    _flat and fan-like_ as in Fig. 13; the twigs of the red cedar are
    _needle-shaped or scale-like_ as in Fig. 12. The foliage of the
    arbor-vitae is of a lighter color than that of the red cedar, which
    is sombre green. The arbor-vitae will generally be found growing in
    moist locations, while the red cedar will grow in dry places as
    well. The arbor-vitae generally retains its lower branches in open
    places, while the branches of the red cedar start at some distance
    from the ground.


RED CEDAR (_Juniperus virginiana_)

[Illustration: FIG. 11.--The Red Cedar.]

Distinguishing characters: The tree can best be told at a glance by its
    general form, size and leaves. It is a medium-sized tree with a
    _symmetrical, cone-like form_, Fig. 11, which, however, broadens
    out somewhat when the tree grows old. Its color throughout the year
    is dull green with a tinge of brownish red, and its bark peels in
    thin strips.

[Illustration:
FIG. 12(a).--Twig of Young Cedar.
FIG. 12(b).--Twig of Cedar (Older Tree).]

Leaf: In young trees the leaf is needle-shaped, pointed, and marked by a
    white line on its under side, Fig. 12(a). In older trees it is
    scale-like, Fig. 12(b), and the white line on its under side is
    indistinct.

Range: Widely distributed over nearly all of eastern and central North
    America.

Soil and location: Grows on poor, gravelly soils as well as in rich
    bottom lands.

Enemies: The "_cedar apple_," commonly found on this tree, represents a
    stage of the apple rust, and for that reason it is not desirable to
    plant such trees near orchards. Its wood is also sometimes attacked
    by small _boring insects_.

Value for planting: Its characteristic slender form gives the red cedar
    an important place as an ornamental tree, but its chief value lies
    in its commercial use.

Commercial value: The wood is durable, light, smooth and fragrant, and
    is therefore used for making lead-pencils, cabinets, boxes,
    moth-proof chests, shingles, posts, and telegraph poles.

Other characters: The _fruit_ is small, round and berry-like, about the
    size of a pea, of dark blue color, and carries from one to four bony
    seeds.

Other common names: The red cedar is also often called _juniper_ and
    _red juniper_.
