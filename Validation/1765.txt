
The outlook was not cheering.  He could not guess that within a
few hours he would be blessing the fate that had thrown him into
the service of Dusar.

"Ah!" exclaimed Hal Vas.  "Here is my father now.  Kaor! Vas Kor.
Here is one you will be glad to meet--a doughty panthan--"  He
hesitated.

"Turjun," interjected Carthoris, seizing upon the first appellation
that occurred to him.

As he spoke his eyes crossed quickly to the tall warrior who was
entering the room.  Where before had he seen that giant figure,
that taciturn countenance, and the livid sword-cut from temple to
mouth?

"Vas Kor," repeated Carthoris mentally.  "Vas Kor!" Where had he
seen the man before?

And then the noble spoke, and like a flash it all came back to
Carthoris--the forward servant upon the landing-stage at Ptarth
that time that he had been explaining the intricacies of his new
compass to Thuvan Dihn; the lone slave that had guarded his own hangar
that night he had left upon his ill-fated journey for Ptarth--the
journey that had brought him so mysteriously to far Aaanthor.

"Vas Kor," he repeated aloud, "blessed be your ancestors for this
meeting," nor did the Dusarian guess the wealth of meaning that lay
beneath that hackneyed phrase with which a Barsoomian acknowledges
an introduction.

"And blessed be yours, Turjun," replied Vas Kor.

Now came the introduction of Kar Komak to Vas Kor, and as Carthoris
went through the little ceremony there came to him the only
explanation he might make to account for the white skin and auburn
hair of the bowman; for he feared that the truth might not be
believed and thus suspicion be cast upon them both from the beginning.

"Kar Komak," he explained, "is, as you can see, a thern.  He
has wandered far from his icebound southern temples in search of
adventure.  I came upon him in the pits of Aaanthor; but though
I have known him so short a time, I can vouch for his bravery and
loyalty."

Since the destruction of the fabric of their false religion by
John Carter, the majority of the therns had gladly accepted the
new order of things, so that it was now no longer uncommon to see
them mingling with the multitudes of red men in any of the great
cities of the outer world, so Vas Kor neither felt nor expressed
any great astonishment.

All during the interview Carthoris watched, catlike, for some
indication that Vas Kor recognized in the battered panthan the
erstwhile gorgeous Prince of Helium; but the sleepless nights, the
long days of marching and fighting, the wounds and the dried blood
had evidently sufficed to obliterate the last remnant of his likeness
to his former self; and then Vas Kor had seen him but twice in all
his life.  Little wonder that he did not know him.

During the evening Vas Kor announced that on the morrow they should
depart north toward Dusar, picking up recruits at various stations
along the way.

In a great field behind the house a flier lay--a fair-sized
cruiser-transport that would accommodate many men, yet swift and
well armed also.  Here Carthoris slept, and Kar Komak, too, with
the other recruits, under guard of the regular Dusarian warriors
that manned the craft.

Toward midnight Vas Kor returned to the vessel from his son's
house, repairing at once to his cabin.  Carthoris, with one of the
Dusarians, was on watch.  It was with difficulty that the Heliumite
repressed a cold smile as the noble passed within a foot of
him--within a foot of the long, slim, Heliumitic blade that swung
in his harness.

How easy it would have been!  How easy to avenge the cowardly
trick that had been played upon him--to avenge Helium and Ptarth
and Thuvia!

But his hand moved not toward the dagger's hilt, for first Vas Kor
must serve a better purpose--he might know where Thuvia of Ptarth
lay hidden now, if it had truly been Dusarians that had spirited
her away during the fight before Aaanthor.

And then, too, there was the instigator of the entire foul plot.
HE must pay the penalty; and who better than Vas Kor could lead
the Prince of Helium to Astok of Dusar?

Faintly out of the night there came to Carthoris's ears the purring
of a distant motor.  He scanned the heavens.

Yes, there it was far in the north, dimly outlined against the
dark void of space that stretched illimitably beyond it, the faint
suggestion of a flier passing, unlighted, through the Barsoomian
night.

Carthoris, knowing not whether the craft might be friend or foe
of Dusar, gave no sign that he had seen, but turned his eyes in
another direction, leaving the matter to the Dusarian who stood
watch with him.

Presently the fellow discovered the oncoming craft, and sounded
the low alarm which brought the balance of the watch and an officer
from their sleeping silks and furs upon the deck near by.

The cruiser-transport lay without lights, and, resting as she was
upon the ground, must have been entirely invisible to the oncoming
flier, which all presently recognized as a small craft.

It soon became evident that the stranger intended making a landing,
for she was now spiraling slowly above them, dropping lower and
lower in each graceful curve.

"It is the Thuria," whispered one of the Dusarian warriors.  "I
would know her in the blackness of the pits among ten thousand
other craft."

"Right you are!" exclaimed Vas Kor, who had come on deck.  And then
he hailed:

"Kaor, Thuria!"

"Kaor!" came presently from above after a brief silence.  Then:
"What ship?"

"Cruiser-transport Kalksus, Vas Kor of Dusar."

"Good!" came from above.  "Is there safe landing alongside?"

"Yes, close in to starboard.  Wait, we will show our lights," and
a moment later the smaller craft settled close beside the Kalksus,
and the lights of the latter were immediately extinguished once
more.

Several figures could be seen slipping over the side of the Thuria
and advancing toward the Kalksus.  Ever suspicious, the Dusarians
stood ready to receive the visitors as friends or foes as closer
inspection might prove them.  Carthoris stood quite near the rail,
ready to take sides with the new-comers should chance have it that
they were Heliumites playing a bold stroke of strategy upon this
lone Dusarian ship.  He had led like parties himself, and knew that
such a contingency was quite possible.

But the face of the first man to cross the rail undeceived him
with a shock that was not at all unpleasurable--it was the face of
Astok, Prince of Dusar.

Scarce noticing the others upon the deck of the Kalksus, Astok
strode forward to accept Vas Kor's greeting, then he summoned the
noble below.  The warriors and officers returned to their sleeping
silks and furs, and once more the deck was deserted except for the
Dusarian warrior and Turjun, the panthan, who stood guard.

The latter walked quietly to and fro.  The former leaned across
the rail, wishing for the hour that would bring him relief.  He
did not see his companion approach the lights of the cabin of Vas
Kor.  He did not see him stoop with ear close pressed to a tiny
ventilator.

"May the white apes take us all," cried Astok ruefully, "if we are
not in as ugly a snarl as you have ever seen!  Nutus thinks that
we have her in hiding far away from Dusar.  He has bidden me bring
her here."

He paused.  No man should have heard from his lips the thing he was
trying to tell.  It should have been for ever the secret of Nutus
and Astok, for upon it rested the safety of a throne.  With that
knowledge any man could wrest from the Jeddak of Dusar whatever he
listed.

But Astok was afraid, and he wanted from this older man the suggestion
of an alternative.  He went on.

"I am to kill her," he whispered, looking fearfully around.  "Nutus
merely wishes to see the body that he may know his commands have
been executed.  I am now supposed to be gone to the spot where we
have her hidden that I may fetch her in secrecy to Dusar.  None
is to know that she has ever been in the keeping of a Dusarian.  I
do not need to tell you what would befall Dusar should Ptarth and
Helium and Kaol ever learn the truth."

The jaws of the listener at the ventilator clicked together with
a vicious snap.  Before he had but guessed at the identity of the
subject of this conversation.  Now he knew.  And they were to kill
her!  His muscular fingers clenched until the nails bit into the
palms.

"And you wish me to go with you while you fetch her to Dusar," Vas
Kor was saying.  "Where is she?"

Astok bent close and whispered into the other's ear.  The suggestion
of a smile crossed the cruel features of Vas Kor.  He realized the
power that lay within his grasp.  He should be a jed at least.

"And how may I help you, my Prince?" asked the older man suavely.

"I cannot kill her," said Astok.  "Issus!  I cannot do it!  When
she turns those eyes upon me my heart becomes water."

Vas Kor's eyes narrowed.

"And you wish--"  He paused, the interrogation unfinished, yet
complete.

Astok nodded.

"YOU do not love her," he said.

"But I love my life--though I am only a lesser noble," he concluded
meaningly.

"You shall be a greater noble--a noble of the first rank!" exclaimed
Astok.

"I would be a jed," said Vas Kor bluntly.

Astok hesitated.

"A jed must die before there can be another jed," he pleaded.

"Jeds have died before," snapped Vas Kor.  "It would doubtless be
not difficult for you to find a jed you do not love, Astok--there
are many who do not love you."

Already Vas Kor was commencing to presume upon his power over the
young prince.  Astok was quick to note and appreciate the subtle
change in his lieutenant.  A cunning scheme entered his weak and
wicked brain.

"As you say, Vas Kor!" he exclaimed.  "You shall be a jed when
the thing is done," and then, to himself:  "Nor will it then be
difficult for me to find a jed I do not love."

"When shall we return to Dusar?" asked the noble.

"At once," replied Astok.  "Let us get under way now--there is
naught to keep you here?"

"I had intended sailing on the morrow, picking up such recruits as
the various Dwars of the Roads might have collected for me, as we
returned to Dusar."

"Let the recruits wait," said Astok.  "Or, better still, come you
to Dusar upon the Thuria, leaving the Kalksus to follow and pick
up the recruits."

"Yes," acquiesced Vas Kor; "that is the better plan.  Come; I am
ready," and he rose to accompany Astok to the latter's flier.

The listener at the ventilator came to his feet slowly, like an
old man.  His face was drawn and pinched and very white beneath
the light copper of his skin.  She was to die!  And he helpless to
avert the tragedy.  He did not even know where she was imprisoned.

The two men were ascending from the cabin to the deck.  Turjun,
the panthan, crept close to the companionway, his sinuous fingers
closing tightly upon the hilt of his dagger.  Could he despatch
them both before he was overpowered?  He smiled.  He could slay an
entire utan of her enemies in his present state of mind.

They were almost abreast of him now.  Astok was speaking.

"Bring a couple of your men along, Vas Kor," he said.  "We are
short-handed upon the Thuria, so quickly did we depart."

The panthan's fingers dropped from the dagger's hilt.  His quick
mind had grasped here a chance for succouring Thuvia of Ptarth.
He might be chosen as one to accompany the assassins, and once he
had learned where the captive lay he could dispatch Astok and Vas
Kor as well as now.  To kill them before he knew where Thuvia was
hid was simply to leave her to death at the hands of others; for
sooner or later Nutus would learn her whereabouts, and Nutus, Jeddak
of Dusar, could not afford to let her live.

Turjun put himself in the path of Vas Kor that he might not be
overlooked.  The noble aroused the men sleeping upon the deck, but
always before him the strange panthan whom he had recruited that
same day found means for keeping himself to the fore.

Vas Kor turned to his lieutenant, giving instruction for the bringing
of the Kalksus to Dusar, and the gathering up of the recruits; then
he signed to two warriors who stood close behind the padwar.

"You two accompany us to the Thuria," he said, "and put yourselves
at the disposal of her dwar."

It was dark upon the deck of the Kalksus, so Vas Kor had not a good
look at the faces of the two he chose; but that was of no moment,
for they were but common warriors to assist with the ordinary duties
upon a flier, and to fight if need be.

One of the two was Kar Komak, the bowman.  The other was not
Carthoris.

The Heliumite was mad with disappointment.  He snatched his dagger
from his harness; but already Astok had left the deck of the Kalksus,
and he knew that before he could overtake him, should he dispatch
Vas Kor, he would be killed by the Dusarian warriors, who now were
thick upon the deck.  With either one of the two alive Thuvia was
in as great danger as though both lived--it must be both!

As Vas Kor descended to the ground Carthoris boldly followed him,
nor did any attempt to halt him, thinking, doubtless, that he was
one of the party.

After him came Kar Komak and the Dusarian warrior who had been
detailed to duty upon the Thuria.  Carthoris walked close to the
left side of the latter.  Now they came to the dense shadow under
the side of the Thuria.  It was very dark there, so that they had
to grope for the ladder.

Kar Komak preceded the Dusarian.  The latter reached upward for
the swinging rounds, and as he did so steel fingers closed upon
his windpipe and a steel blade pierced the very centre of his heart.

Turjun, the panthan, was the last to clamber over the rail of the
Thuria, drawing the rope ladder in after him.

A moment later the flier was rising rapidly, headed for the north.

At the rail Kar Komak turned to speak to the warrior who had been
detailed to accompany him.  His eyes went wide as they rested
upon the face of the young man whom he had met beside the granite
cliffs that guard mysterious Lothar.  How had he come in place of
the Dusarian?

A quick sign, and Kar Komak turned once more to find the Thuria's
dwar that he might report himself for duty.  Behind him followed
the panthan.
