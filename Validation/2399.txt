Old Rambling House

By FRANK HERBERT


 _All the Grahams desired was a
 home they could call their own
 ... but what did the home want?_


Illustrated by JOHNSON


On his last night on Earth, Ted Graham stepped out of a glass-walled
telephone booth, ducked to avoid a swooping moth that battered itself in
a frenzy against a bare globe above the booth.

Ted Graham was a long-necked man with a head of pronounced egg shape
topped by prematurely balding sandy hair. Something about his lanky,
intense appearance suggested his occupation: certified public
accountant.

He stopped behind his wife, who was studying a newspaper classified
page, and frowned. "They said to wait here. They'll come get us. Said
the place is hard to find at night."

Martha Graham looked up from the newspaper. She was a doll-faced woman,
heavily pregnant, a kind of pink prettiness about her. The yellow glow
from the light above the booth subdued the red-auburn cast of her
ponytail hair.

"I just _have_ to be in a house when the baby's born," she said. "What'd
they sound like?"

"I dunno. There was a funny kind of interruption--like an argument in
some foreign language."

"Did they sound foreign?"

"In a way." He motioned along the night-shrouded line of trailers toward
one with two windows glowing amber. "Let's wait inside. These bugs out
here are fierce."

"Did you tell them which trailer is ours?"

"Yes. They didn't sound at all anxious to look at it. That's odd--them
wanting to trade their house for a trailer."
