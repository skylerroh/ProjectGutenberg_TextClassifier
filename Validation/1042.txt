Then Jonathan and they that were with him leapt into Jordan,
and swam over unto the other bank: howbeit the other passed not
over Jordan unto them.

1 Mac 9:49
So there were slain of Bacchides' side that day about a
thousand men.

1 Mac 9:50
Afterward returned Bacchides to Jerusalem and repaired the
strong cites in Judea; the fort in Jericho, and Emmaus, and
Bethhoron, and Bethel, and Thamnatha, Pharathoni, and Taphon,
these did he strengthen with high walls, with gates and with
bars.

1 Mac 9:51
And in them he set a garrison, that they might work malice
upon Israel.

1 Mac 9:52
He fortified also the city Bethsura, and Gazera, and the
tower, and put forces in them, and provision of victuals.

1 Mac 9:53
Besides, he took the chief men's sons in the country for
hostages, and put them into the tower at Jerusalem to be kept.

1 Mac 9:54
Moreover in the hundred fifty and third year, in the second
month, Alcimus commanded that the wall of the inner court of the
sanctuary should be pulled down; he pulled down also the works
of the prophets

1 Mac 9:55
And as he began to pull down, even at that time was Alcimus
plagued, and his enterprizes hindered: for his mouth was
stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, so that he could no more
speak any thing, nor give order concerning his house.

1 Mac 9:56
So Alcimus died at that time with great torment.

1 Mac 9:57
Now when Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, he returned to
the king: whereupon the land of Judea was in rest two years.

1 Mac 9:58
Then all the ungodly men held a council, saying, Behold,
Jonathan and his company are at ease, and dwell without care:
now therefore we will bring Bacchides hither, who shall take
them all in one night.

1 Mac 9:59
So they went and consulted with him.

1 Mac 9:60
Then removed he, and came with a great host, and sent letters
privily to his adherents in Judea, that they should take
Jonathan and those that were with him: howbeit they could not,
because their counsel was known unto them.

1 Mac 9:61
Wherefore they took of the men of the country, that were
authors of that mischief, about fifty persons, and slew them.

1 Mac 9:62
Afterward Jonathan, and Simon, and they that were with him,
got them away to Bethbasi, which is in the wilderness, and they
repaired the decays thereof, and made it strong.

1 Mac 9:63
Which thing when Bacchides knew, he gathered together all his
host, and sent word to them that were of Judea.

1 Mac 9:64
Then went he and laid siege against Bethbasi; and they fought
against it a long season and made engines of war.

1 Mac 9:65
But Jonathan left his brother Simon in the city, and went
forth himself into the country, and with a certain number went
he forth.

1 Mac 9:66
And he smote Odonarkes and his brethren, and the children of
Phasiron in their tent.

1 Mac 9:67
And when he began to smite them, and came up with his forces,
Simon and his company went out of the city, and burned up the
engines of war,

1 Mac 9:68
And fought against Bacchides, who was discomfited by them,
and they afflicted him sore: for his counsel and travail was in
vain.

1 Mac 9:69
Wherefore he was very wroth at the wicked men that gave him
counsel to come into the country, inasmuch as he slew many of
them, and purposed to return into his own country.

1 Mac 9:70
Whereof when Jonathan had knowledge, he sent ambassadors unto
him, to the end he should make peace with him, and deliver them
the prisoners.

1 Mac 9:71
Which thing he accepted, and did according to his demands,
and sware unto him that he would never do him harm all the days
of his life.

1 Mac 9:72
When therefore he had restored unto him the prisoners that he
had taken aforetime out of the land of Judea, he returned and
went his way into his own land, neither came he any more into
their borders.

1 Mac 9:73
Thus the sword ceased from Israel: but Jonathan dwelt at
Machmas, and began to govern the people; and he destroyed the
ungodly men out of Israel.

1 Mac 10:1
In the hundred and sixtieth year Alexander, the son of
Antiochus surnamed Epiphanes, went up and took Ptolemais: for
the people had received him, by means whereof he reigned there,

1 Mac 10:2
Now when king Demetrius heard thereof, he gathered together
an exceeding great host, and went forth against him to fight.

1 Mac 10:3
Moreover Demetrius sent letters unto Jonathan with loving
words, so as he magnified him.

1 Mac 10:4
For said he, Let us first make peace with him, before he join
with Alexander against us:

1 Mac 10:5
Else he will remember all the evils that we have done against
him, and against his brethren and his people.

1 Mac 10:6
Wherefore he gave him authority to gather together an host,
and to provide weapons, that he might aid him in battle: he
commanded also that the hostages that were in the tower should
be delivered him.

1 Mac 10:7
Then came Jonathan to Jerusalem, and read the letters in the
audience of all the people, and of them that were in the tower:

1 Mac 10:8
Who were sore afraid, when they heard that the king had given
him authority to gather together an host.

1 Mac 10:9
Whereupon they of the tower delivered their hostages unto
Jonathan, and he delivered them unto their parents.

1 Mac 10:10
This done, Jonathan settled himself in Jerusalem, and began
to build and repair the city.

1 Mac 10:11
And he commanded the workmen to build the walls and the mount
Sion and about with square stones for fortification; and they
did so.

1 Mac 10:12
Then the strangers, that were in the fortresses which
Bacchides had built, fled away;

1 Mac 10:13
Insomuch as every man left his place, and went into his own
country.

1 Mac 10:14
Only at Bethsura certain of those that had forsaken the law
and the commandments remained still: for it was their place of
refuge.

1 Mac 10:15
Now when king Alexander had heard what promises Demetrius had
sent unto Jonathan: when also it was told him of the battles and
noble acts which he and his brethren had done, and of the pains
that they had endured,

1 Mac 10:16
He said, Shall we find such another man? now therefore we
will make him our friend and confederate.

1 Mac 10:17
Upon this he wrote a letter, and sent it unto him, according
to these words, saying,

1 Mac 10:18
King Alexander to his brother Jonathan sendeth greeting:

1 Mac 10:19
We have heard of thee, that thou art a man of great power,
and meet to be our friend.

1 Mac 10:20
Wherefore now this day we ordain thee to be the high priest
of thy nation, and to be called the king's friend; (and
therewithal he sent him a purple robe and a crown of gold:) and
require thee to take our part, and keep friendship with us.

1 Mac 10:21
So in the seventh month of the hundred and sixtieth year, at
the feast of the tabernacles, Jonathan put on the holy robe, and
gathered together forces, and provided much armour.

1 Mac 10:22
Whereof when Demetrius heard, he was very sorry, and said,

1 Mac 10:23
What have we done, that Alexander hath prevented us in making
amity with the Jews to strengthen himself?

1 Mac 10:24
I also will write unto them words of encouragement, and
promise them dignities and gifts, that I may have their aid.

1 Mac 10:25
He sent unto them therefore to this effect: King Demetrius
unto the people of the Jews sendeth greeting:

1 Mac 10:26
Whereas ye have kept covenants with us, and continued in our
friendship, not joining yourselves with our enemies, we have
heard hereof, and are glad.

1 Mac 10:27
Wherefore now continue ye still to be faithful unto us, and
we will well recompense you for the things ye do in our behalf,

1 Mac 10:28
And will grant you many immunities, and give you rewards.

1 Mac 10:29
And now do I free you, and for your sake I release all the
Jews, from tributes, and from the customs of salt, and from
crown taxes,

1 Mac 10:30
And from that which appertaineth unto me to receive for the
third part or the seed, and the half of the fruit of the trees,
I release it from this day forth, so that they shall not be
taken of the land of Judea, nor of the three governments which
are added thereunto out of the country of Samaria and Galilee,
from this day forth for evermore.

1 Mac 10:31
Let Jerusalem also be holy and free, with the borders
thereof, both from tenths and tributes.

1 Mac 10:32
And as for the tower which is at Jerusalem, I yield up
authority over it, and give the high priest, that he may set in
it such men as he shall choose to keep it.

1 Mac 10:33
Moreover I freely set at liberty every one of the Jews, that
were carried captives out of the land of Judea into any part of
my kingdom, and I will that all my officers remit the tributes
even of their cattle.

1 Mac 10:34
Furthermore I will that all the feasts, and sabbaths, and new
moons, and solemn days, and the three days before the feast, and
the three days after the feast shall be all of immunity and
freedom for all the Jews in my realm.

1 Mac 10:35
Also no man shall have authority to meddle with or to molest
any of them in any matter.

1 Mac 10:36
I will further, that there be enrolled among the king's
forces about thirty thousand men of the Jews, unto whom pay
shall be given, as belongeth to all king's forces.

1 Mac 10:37
And of them some shall be placed in the king's strong holds,
of whom also some shall be set over the affairs of the kingdom,
which are of trust: and I will that their overseers and
governors be of themselves, and that they live after their own
laws, even as the king hath commanded in the land of Judea.

1 Mac 10:38
And concerning the three governments that are added to Judea
from the country of Samaria, let them be joined with Judea, that
they may be reckoned to be under one, nor bound to obey other
authority than the high priest's.

1 Mac 10:39
As for Ptolemais, and the land pertaining thereto, I give it
as a free gift to the sanctuary at Jerusalem for the necessary
expences of the sanctuary.

1 Mac 10:40
Moreover I give every year fifteen thousand shekels of silver
out of the king's accounts from the places appertaining.

1 Mac 10:41
And all the overplus, which the officers payed not in as in
former time, from henceforth shall be given toward the works of
the temple.

1 Mac 10:42
And beside this, the five thousand shekels of silver, which
they took from the uses of the temple out of the accounts year
by year, even those things shall be released, because they
appertain to the priests that minister.

1 Mac 10:43
And whosoever they be that flee unto the temple at Jerusalem,
or be within the liberties hereof, being indebted unto the king,
or for any other matter, let them be at liberty, and all that
they have in my realm.

1 Mac 10:44
For the building also and repairing of the works of the
sanctuary expences shall be given of the king's accounts.

1 Mac 10:45
Yea, and for the building of the walls of Jerusalem, and the
fortifying thereof round about, expences shall be given out of
the king's accounts, as also for the building of the walls in
Judea.

1 Mac 10:46
Now when Jonathan and the people heard these words, they gave
no credit unto them, nor received them, because they remembered
the great evil that he had done in Israel; for he had afflicted
them very sore.

1 Mac 10:47
But with Alexander they were well pleased, because he was the
first that entreated of true peace with them, and they were
confederate with him always.

1 Mac 10:48
Then gathered king Alexander great forces, and camped over
against Demetrius.

1 Mac 10:49
And after the two kings had joined battle, Demetrius' host
fled: but Alexander followed after him, and prevailed against
them.

1 Mac 10:50
And he continued the battle very sore until the sun went
down: and that day was Demetrius slain.

1 Mac 10:51
Afterward Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemee king of
Egypt with a message to this effect:

1 Mac 10:52
Forasmuch as I am come again to my realm, and am set in the
throne of my progenitors, and have gotten the dominion, and
overthrown Demetrius, and recovered our country;

1 Mac 10:53
For after I had joined battle with him, both he and his host
was discomfited by us, so that we sit in the throne of his
kingdom:

1 Mac 10:54
Now therefore let us make a league of amity together, and
give me now thy daughter to wife: and I will be thy son in law,
and will give both thee and her as according to thy dignity.

1 Mac 10:55
Then Ptolemee the king gave answer, saying, Happy be the day
wherein thou didst return into the land of thy fathers, and
satest in the throne of their kingdom.

1 Mac 10:56
And now will I do to thee, as thou hast written: meet me
therefore at Ptolemais, that we may see one another; for I will
marry my daughter to thee according to thy desire.

1 Mac 10:57
So Ptolemee went out of Egypt with his daughter Cleopatra,
and they came unto Ptolemais in the hundred threescore and
second year:

1 Mac 10:58
Where king Alexander meeting him, he gave unto him his
daughter Cleopatra, and celebrated her marriage at Ptolemais
with great glory, as the manner of kings is.

1 Mac 10:59
Now king Alexander had written unto Jonathan, that he should
come and meet him.

1 Mac 10:60
Who thereupon went honourably to Ptolemais, where he met the
two kings, and gave them and their friends silver and gold, and
many presents, and found favour in their sight.

1 Mac 10:61
At that time certain pestilent fellows of Israel, men of a
wicked life, assembled themselves against him, to accuse him:
but the king would not hear them.

1 Mac 10:62
Yea more than that, the king commanded to take off his
garments, and clothe him in purple: and they did so.

1 Mac 10:63
And he made him sit by himself, and said into his princes, Go
with him into the midst of the city, and make proclamation, that
no man complain against him of any matter, and that no man
trouble him for any manner of cause.

1 Mac 10:64
Now when his accusers saw that he was honored according to
the proclamation, and clothed in purple, they fled all away.

1 Mac 10:65
So the king honoured him, and wrote him among his chief
friends, and made him a duke, and partaker of his dominion.

1 Mac 10:66
Afterward Jonathan returned to Jerusalem with peace and
gladness.

1 Mac 10:67
Furthermore in the hundred threescore and fifth year came
Demetrius son of Demetrius out of Crete into the land of his
fathers:

1 Mac 10:68
Whereof when king Alexander heard tell, he was right sorry,
and returned into Antioch.

1 Mac 10:69
Then Demetrius made Apollonius the governor of Celosyria his
general, who gathered together a great host, and camped in
Jamnia, and sent unto Jonathan the high priest, saying,

1 Mac 10:70
Thou alone liftest up thyself against us, and I am laughed to
scorn for thy sake, and reproached: and why dost thou vaunt thy
power against us in the mountains?

1 Mac 10:71
Now therefore, if thou trustest in thine own strength, come
down to us into the plain field, and there let us try the matter
together: for with me is the power of the cities.

1 Mac 10:72
Ask and learn who I am, and the rest that take our part, and
they shall tell thee that thy foot is not able to to flight in
their own land.

1 Mac 10:73
Wherefore now thou shalt not be able to abide the horsemen
and so great a power in the plain, where is neither stone nor
flint, nor place to flee unto.

1 Mac 10:74
So when Jonathan heard these words of Apollonius, he was
moved in his mind, and choosing ten thousand men he went out of
Jerusalem, where Simon his brother met him for to help him.

1 Mac 10:75
And he pitched his tents against Joppa: but; they of Joppa
shut him out of the city, because Apollonius had a garrison
there.

1 Mac 10:76
Then Jonathan laid siege unto it: whereupon they of the city
let him in for fear: and so Jonathan won Joppa.

1 Mac 10:77
Whereof when Apollonius heard, he took three thousand
horsemen, with a great host of footmen, and went to Azotus as
one that journeyed, and therewithal drew him forth into the
plain, because he had a great number of horsemen, in whom he put
his trust.

1 Mac 10:78
Then Jonathan followed after him to Azotus, where the armies
joined battle.

1 Mac 10:79
Now Apollonius had left a thousand horsemen in ambush.

1 Mac 10:80
And Jonathan knew that there was an ambushment behind him;
for they had compassed in his host, and cast darts at the
people, from morning till evening.

1 Mac 10:81
But the people stood still, as Jonathan had commanded them:
and so the enemies' horses were tired.

1 Mac 10:82
Then brought Simon forth his host, and set them against the
footmen, (for the horsemen were spent) who were discomfited by
him, and fled.

1 Mac 10:83
The horsemen also, being scattered in the field, fled to
Azotus, and went into Bethdagon, their idol's temple, for
safety.

1 Mac 10:84
But Jonathan set fire on Azotus, and the cities round about
it, and took their spoils; and the temple of Dagon, with them
that were fled into it, he burned with fire.

1 Mac 10:85
Thus there were burned and slain with the sword well nigh
eight thousand men.

1 Mac 10:86
And from thence Jonathan removed his host, and camped against
Ascalon, where the men of the city came forth, and met him with
great pomp.

1 Mac 10:87
After this returned Jonathan and his host unto Jerusalem,
having any spoils.

1 Mac 10:88
Now when king ALexander heard these things, he honoured
Jonathan yet more.

1 Mac 10:89
And sent him a buckle of gold, as the use is to be given to
such as are of the king's blood: he gave him also Accaron with
the borders thereof in possession.

1 Mac 11:1
And the king of Egypt gathered together a great host, like
the sand that lieth upon the sea shore, and many ships, and went
about through deceit to get Alexander's kingdom, and join it to
his own.

1 Mac 11:2
Whereupon he took his journey into Spain in peaceable manner,
so as they of the cities opened unto him, and met him: for king
Alexander had commanded them so to do, because he was his
brother in law.

1 Mac 11:3
Now as Ptolemee entered into the cities, he set in every one
of them a garrison of soldiers to keep it.

1 Mac 11:4
And when he came near to Azotus, they shewed him the temple
of Dagon that was burnt, and Azotus and the suburbs thereof that
were destroyed, and the bodies that were cast abroad and them
that he had burnt in the battle; for they had made heaps of them
by the way where he should pass.

1 Mac 11:5
Also they told the king whatsoever Jonathan had done, to the
intent he might blame him: but the king held his peace.

1 Mac 11:6
Then Jonathan met the king with great pomp at Joppa, where
they saluted one another, and lodged.

1 Mac 11:7
Afterward Jonathan, when he had gone with the king to the
river called Eleutherus, returned again to Jerusalem.

1 Mac 11:8
King Ptolemee therefore, having gotten the dominion of the
cities by the sea unto Seleucia upon the sea coast, imagined
wicked counsels against Alexander.

1 Mac 11:9
Whereupon he sent ambasadors unto king Demetrius, saying,
Come, let us make a league betwixt us, and I will give thee my
daughter whom Alexander hath, and thou shalt reign in thy
father's kingdom:

1 Mac 11:10
For I repent that I gave my daughter unto him, for he sought
to slay me.

1 Mac 11:11
Thus did he slander him, because he was desirous of his
kingdom.

1 Mac 11:12
Wherefore he took his daughter from him, and gave her to
Demetrius, and forsook Alexander, so that their hatred was
openly known.

1 Mac 11:13
Then Ptolemee entered into Antioch, where he set two crowns
upon his head, the crown of Asia, and of Egypt.

1 Mac 11:14
In the mean season was king Alexander in Cilicia, because
those that dwelt in those parts had revolted from him.

1 Mac 11:15
But when Alexander heard of this, he came to war against him:
whereupon king Ptolemee brought forth his host, and met him with
a mighty power, and put him to flight.

1 Mac 11:16
So Alexander fled into Arabia there to be defended; but king
Ptolemee was exalted:

1 Mac 11:17
For Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexander's head, and sent
it unto Ptolemee.

1 Mac 11:18
King Ptolemee also died the third day after, and they that
were in the strong holds were slain one of another.

1 Mac 11:19
By this means Demetrius reigned in the hundred threescore and
seventh year.

1 Mac 11:20
At the same time Jonathan gathered together them that were in
Judea to take the tower that was in Jerusalem: and he made many
engines of war against it.

1 Mac 11:21
Then came ungodly persons, who hated their own people, went
unto the king, and told him that Jonathan besieged the tower,

1 Mac 11:22
Whereof when he heard, he was angry, and immediately
removing, he came to Ptolemais, and wrote unto Jonathan, that he
should not lay siege to the tower, but come and speak with him
at Ptolemais in great haste.

1 Mac 11:23
Nevertheless Jonathan, when he heard this, commanded to
besiege it still: and he chose certain of the elders of Israel
and the priests, and put himself in peril;

1 Mac 11:24
And took silver and gold, and raiment, and divers presents
besides, and went to Ptolemais unto the king, where he found
favour in his sight.

1 Mac 11:25
And though certain ungodly men of the people had made
complaints against him,

1 Mac 11:26
Yet the king entreated him as his predecessors had done
before, and promoted him in the sight of all his friends,

1 Mac 11:27
And confirmed him in the high priesthood, and in all the
honours that he had before, and gave him preeminence among his
chief friends.

1 Mac 11:28
Then Jonathan desired the king, that he would make Judea free
from tribute, as also the three governments, with the country of
Samaria; and he promised him three hundred talents.

1 Mac 11:29
So the king consented, and wrote letters unto Jonathan of all
these things after this manner:

1 Mac 11:30
King Demetrius unto his brother Jonathan, and unto the nation
of the Jews, sendeth greeting:

1 Mac 11:31
We send you here a copy of the letter which we did write unto
our cousin Lasthenes concerning you, that ye might see it.

1 Mac 11:32
King Demetrius unto his father Lasthenes sendeth greeting:

1 Mac 11:33
We are determined to do good to the people of the Jews, who
are our friends, and keep covenants with us, because of their
good will toward us.

1 Mac 11:34
Wherefore we have ratified unto them the borders of Judea,
with the three governments of Apherema and Lydda and Ramathem,
that are added unto Judea from the country of Samaria, and all
things appertaining unto them, for all such as do sacrifice in
Jerusalem, instead of the payments which the king received of
them yearly aforetime out of the fruits of the earth and of
trees.

1 Mac 11:35
And as for other things that belong unto us, of the tithes
and customs pertaining unto us, as also the saltpits, and the
crown taxes, which are due unto us, we discharge them of them
all for their relief.

1 Mac 11:36
And nothing hereof shall be revoked from this time forth for
ever.

1 Mac 11:37
Now therefore see that thou make a copy of these things, and
let it be delivered unto Jonathan, and set upon the holy mount
in a conspicuous place.

1 Mac 11:38
After this, when king Demetrius saw that the land was quiet
before him, and that no resistance was made against him, he sent
away all his forces, every one to his own place, except certain
bands of strangers, whom he had gathered from the isles of the
heathen: wherefore all the forces of his fathers hated him.

1 Mac 11:39
Moreover there was one Tryphon, that had been of Alexander's
part afore, who, seeing that all the host murmured against
Demetrius, went to Simalcue the Arabian that brought up
Antiochus the young son of Alexander,

1 Mac 11:40
And lay sore upon him to deliver him this young Antiochus,
that he might reign in his father's stead: he told him therefore
all that Demetrius had done, and how his men of war were at
enmity with him, and there he remained a long season.

1 Mac 11:41
In the mean time Jonathan sent unto king Demetrius, that he
would cast those of the tower out of Jerusalem, and those also
in the fortresses: for they fought against Israel.

1 Mac 11:42
So Demetrius sent unto Jonathan, saying, I will not only do
this for thee and thy people, but I will greatly honour thee and
thy nation, if opportunity serve.

1 Mac 11:43
Now therefore thou shalt do well, if thou send me men to help
me; for all my forces are gone from me.

1 Mac 11:44
Upon this Jonathan sent him three thousand strong men unto
Antioch: and when they came to the king, the king was very glad
of their coming.

1 Mac 11:45
Howbeit they that were of the city gathered themselves
together into the midst of the city, to the number of an hundred
and twenty thousand men, and would have slain the king.

1 Mac 11:46
Wherefore the king fled into the court, but they of the city
kept the passages of the city, and began to fight.

1 Mac 11:47
Then the king called to the Jews for help, who came unto him
all at once, and dispersing themselves through the city slew
that day in the city to the number of an hundred thousand.

1 Mac 11:48
Also they set fire on the city, and gat many spoils that day,
and delivered the king.

1 Mac 11:49
So when they of the city saw that the Jews had got the city
as they would, their courage was abated: wherefore they made
supplication to the king, and cried, saying,

1 Mac 11:50
Grant us peace, and let the Jews cease from assaulting us and
the city.

1 Mac 11:51
With that they cast away their weapons, and made peace; and
the Jews were honoured in the sight of the king, and in the
sight of all that were in his realm; and they returned to
Jerusalem, having great spoils.

1 Mac 11:52
So king Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the
land was quiet before him.

1 Mac 11:53
Nevertheless he dissembled in all that ever he spake, and
estranged himself from Jonathan, neither rewarded he him
according to the benefits which he had received of him, but
troubled him very sore.

1 Mac 11:54
After this returned Tryphon, and with him the young child
Antiochus, who reigned, and was crowned.

1 Mac 11:55
Then there gathered unto him all the men of war, whom
Demetrius had put away, and they fought against Demetrius, who
turned his back and fled.

1 Mac 11:56
Moreover Tryphon took the elephants, and won Antioch.

1 Mac 11:57
At that time young Antiochus wrote unto Jonathan, saying, I
confirm thee in the high priesthood, and appoint thee ruler over
the four governments, and to be one of the king's friends.

1 Mac 11:58
Upon this he sent him golden vessels to be served in, and
gave him leave to drink in gold, and to be clothed in purple,
and to wear a golden buckle.

1 Mac 11:59
His brother Simon also he made captain from the place called
The ladder of Tyrus unto the borders of Egypt.

1 Mac 11:60
Then Jonathan went forth, and passed through the cities
beyond the water, and all the forces of Syria gathered
themselves unto him for to help him: and when he came to
Ascalon, they of the city met him honourably.

1 Mac 11:61
From whence he went to Gaza, but they of Gaza shut him out;
wherefore he laid siege unto it, and burned the suburbs thereof
with fire, and spoiled them.

1 Mac 11:62
Afterward, when they of Gaza made supplication unto Jonathan,
he made peace with them, and took the sons of their chief men
for hostages, and sent them to Jerusalem, and passed through the
country unto Damascus.

1 Mac 11:63
Now when Jonathan heard that Demetrius' princes were come to
Cades, which is in Galilee, with a great power, purposing to
remove him out of the country,

1 Mac 11:64
He went to meet them, and left Simon his brother in the
country.

1 Mac 11:65
Then Simon encamped against Bethsura and fought against it a
long season, and shut it up:

1 Mac 11:66
But they desired to have peace with him, which he granted
them, and then put them out from thence, and took the city, and
set a garrison in it.

1 Mac 11:67
As for Jonathan and his host, they pitched at the water of
Gennesar, from whence betimes in the morning they gat them to
the plain of Nasor.

1 Mac 11:68
And, behold, the host of strangers met them in the plain,
who, having laid men in ambush for him in the mountains, came
themselves over against him.

1 Mac 11:69
So when they that lay in ambush rose out of their places and
joined battle, all that were of Jonathan's side fled;

1 Mac 11:70
Insomuch as there was not one of them left, except Mattathias
the son of Absalom, and Judas the son of Calphi, the captains of
the host.

1 Mac 11:71
Then Jonathan rent his clothes, and cast earth upon his head,
and prayed.

1 Mac 11:72
Afterwards turning again to battle, he put them to flight,
and so they ran away.

1 Mac 11:73
Now when his own men that were fled saw this, they turned
again unto him, and with him pursued them to Cades, even unto
their own tents, and there they camped.

1 Mac 11:74
So there were slain of the heathen that day about three
thousand men: but Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.

1 Mac 12:1
Now when Jonathan saw that time served him, he chose certain
men, and sent them to Rome, for to confirm and renew the
friendship that they had with them.
