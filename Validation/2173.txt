"You left some money in my charge yesterday, Mr. Larkin," said
the clerk.

"Yes."

"Your friend here claims it. Am I to give it to him?"

Luke's eyes lighted up indignantly.

"What does this mean, Mr. Coleman?" he demanded, sternly.

"It means," answered Coleman, throwing off the mask, "that the
money is mine, and that you have no right to it."

If Luke had not witnessed Coleman's search of his pockets during
the night, he would have been very much astonished at this brazen
statement. As it was, he had already come to the conclusion that
his railroad acquaintance was a sharper.

"I will trouble you to prove your claim to it," said Luke, not at
all disturbed by Coleman's impudent assertion.

"I gave it to you yesterday to place in the safe. I did not
expect you would put it in in your own name," continued Coleman,
with brazen hardihood.

"When did you hand it to me?" asked Luke, calmly.

"When we first went up into the room."

This change in his original charge Coleman made in consequence
of learning the time of the deposit.

"This is an utter falsehood!" exclaimed Luke, indignantly.

"Take care, young fellow!" blustered Coleman. "Your reputation for
honesty isn't of the best. I don't like to expose you, but a boy
who has served a three months' term in the penitentiary had better
be careful how he acts."

Luke's breath was quite taken away by this unexpected attack. The
clerk began to eye him with suspicion, so confident was Coleman's
tone.

"Mr. Lawrence," said Luke, for he had learned the clerk's name,
"will you allow me a word in private?"

"I object to this," said Coleman, in a blustering tone. "Whatever
you have to say you can say before me."

"Yes," answered the clerk, who did not like Coleman's bullying
tone, "I will hear what you have to say."

He led the way into an adjoining room, and assumed an air of
attention.

"This man is a stranger to me," Luke commenced. "I saw him yesterday
afternoon for the first time in my life."

"But he says he is your guardian."

"He is no more my guardian than you are. Indeed, I would much sooner
select you."

"How did you get acquainted?"

"He introduced himself to me as a traveler for H. B. Claflin, of
New York. I did not doubt his statement at the time, but now I do,
especially after what happened in the night."

"What was that?" asked the clerk, pricking up his ears.

Luke went on to describe Coleman's search of his pockets.

"Did you say anything?"

"No. I wished to see what he was after. As I had left nearly all
my money with you, I was not afraid of being robbed."

"I presume your story is correct. In fact, I detected him in a
misstatement as to the time of giving you the money. But I don't
want to get into trouble."

"Ask him how much money I deposited with you," suggested Luke.
"He has no idea, and will have to guess."

"I have asked him the question once, but will do so again."

The clerk returned to the office with Luke. Coleman eyed them
uneasily, as if he suspected them of having been engaged in a
conspiracy against him.

"Well," he said, "are you going to give me my money?"

"State the amount," said the clerk, in a businesslike manner.

"I have already told you that I can't state exactly. I handed
the money to Luke without counting it."

"You must have some idea, at any rate," said the clerk.

"Of course I have. There was somewhere around seventy-five dollars."

This he said with a confidence which he did not feel, for it
was, of course, a mere guess.

"You are quite out in your estimate, Mr. Coleman. It is evident to
me that you have made a false claim. You will oblige me by settling
your bill and leaving the hotel."

"Do you think I will submit to such treatment?" demanded
Coleman, furiously.

"I think you'll have to," returned the clerk, quietly. "You can
go in to breakfast, if you like, but you must afterward leave the
hotel. John," this to a bellboy, "go up to number forty-seven and
bring down this gentleman's luggage."

"You and the boy are in a conspiracy against me!" exclaimed
Coleman, angrily. "I have a great mind to have you both arrested!"

"I advise you not to attempt it. You may get into trouble."

Coleman apparently did think better of it. Half an hour later he
left the hotel, and Luke found himself alone. He decided that he
must be more circumspect hereafter.



CHAPTER XXX

A DISCOVERY


Luke was in Chicago, but what to do next he did not know. He might
have advertised in one or more of the Chicago papers for James
Harding, formerly in the employ of John Armstrong, of New York,
but if this should come to the knowledge of the party who had
appropriated the bonds, it might be a revelation of the weakness of
the case against them. Again, he might apply to a private detective,
but if he did so, the case would pass out of his hands.

Luke had this piece of information to start upon. He had been
informed that Harding left Mr. Armstrong's employment June 17, 1879,
and, as was supposed, at once proceeded West. If he could get hold
of a file of some Chicago daily paper for the week succeeding, he
might look over the last arrivals, and ascertain at what hotel
Harding had stopped. This would be something.

"Where can I examine a file of some Chicago daily paper for 1879,
Mr. Lawrence?" he asked of the clerk.

"Right here," answered the clerk. "Mr. Goth, the landlord, has a
file of the Times for the last ten years."

"Would he let me examine the volume for 1879?" asked Luke, eagerly.

"Certainly. I am busy just now, but this afternoon I will have the
papers brought down to the reading-room."

He was as good as his word, and at three o'clock in the afternoon
Luke sat down before a formidable pile of papers, and began his
task of examination.

He began with the paper bearing date June 19, and examined that and
the succeeding papers with great care. At length his search was
rewarded. In the paper for June 23 Luke discovered the name of James
Harding, and, what was a little singular, he was registered at the
Ottawa House.

Luke felt quite exultant at this discovery. It might not lead to
anything, to be sure, but still it was an encouragement, and seemed
to augur well for his ultimate success.

He went with his discovery to his friend the clerk.

"Were you here in June, 1879, Mr. Lawrence?" he asked.

"Yes. I came here in April of that year."

"Of course, you could hardly be expected to remember a
casual guest?"

"I am afraid not. What is his name?"

"James Harding."

"James Harding! Yes, I do remember him, and for a very good reason.
He took a very severe cold on the way from New York, and he lay here
in the hotel sick for two weeks. He was an elderly man, about
fifty-five, I should suppose."

"That answers to the description given me. Do you know where he
went to from here?"

"There you have me. I can't give you any information on
that point."

Luke began to think that his discovery would lead to nothing.

"Stay, though," said the clerk, after a moment's thought. "I
remember picking up a small diary in Mr. Harding's room after he
left us. I didn't think it of sufficient value to forward to him,
nor indeed did I know exactly where to send."

"Can you show me the diary?" asked Luke, hopefully.

"Yes. I have it upstairs in my chamber. Wait five minutes and
I will get it for you."

A little later a small, black-covered diary was put in Luke's hand.
He opened it eagerly, and began to examine the items jotted down.
It appeared partly to note down daily expenses, but on alternate
pages there were occasional memorandums. About the fifteenth of May
appeared this sentence: "I have reason to think that my sister, Mrs.
Ellen Ransom, is now living in Franklin, Minnesota. She is probably
in poor circumstances, her husband having died in poverty a year
since. We two are all that is left of a once large family, and now
that I am shortly to retire from business with a modest competence,
I feel it will be alike my duty and my pleasure to join her, and do
what I can to make her comfortable. She has a boy who must now be
about twelve years old."

"Come," said Luke, triumphantly, "I am making progress decidedly.
My first step will be to go to Franklin, Minnesota, and look up Mr.
Harding and his sister. After all, I ought to be grateful to Mr.
Coleman, notwithstanding his attempt to rob me. But for him I should
never have come to the Ottawa House, and thus I should have lost an
important clue."

Luke sat down immediately and wrote to Mr. Armstrong, detailing the
discovery he had made--a letter which pleased his employer, and led
him to conclude that he had made a good choice in selecting Luke
for this confidential mission.

The next day Luke left Chicago and journeyed by the most direct
route to Franklin, Minnesota. He ascertained that it was forty miles
distant from St. Paul, a few miles off the railroad. The last part
of the journey was performed in a stage, and was somewhat wearisome.
He breathed a sigh of relief when the stage stopped before the door
of a two-story inn with a swinging sign, bearing the name Franklin
House.

Luke entered his name on the register and secured a room. He decided
to postpone questions till he had enjoyed a good supper and felt
refreshed. Then he went out to the desk and opened a conversation
with the landlord, or rather submitted first to answering a series
of questions propounded by that gentleman.

"You're rather young to be travelin' alone, my young friend," said
the innkeeper.

"Yes, sir."

"Where might you be from?"

"From New York."

"Then you're a long way from home. Travelin' for your health?"

"No," answered Luke, with a smile. "I have no trouble with
my health."

"You do look pretty rugged, that's a fact. Goin' to settle
down in our State?"

"I think not."

"I reckon you're not travelin' on business? You're too young
for a drummer."

"The fact is, I am in search of a family that I have been told
lives, or used to live, in Franklin."

"What's the name?"

"The lady is a Mrs. Ransom. I wish to see her brother-in-law,
Mr. James Harding."

"Sho! You'll have to go farther to find them."

"Don't they live here now?" asked Luke, disappointed.

"No; they moved away six months ago."

"Do you know where they went?" asked Luke, eagerly.

"Not exactly. You see, there was a great stir about gold being
plenty in the Black Hills, and Mr. Harding, though he seemed to
be pretty well fixed, thought he wouldn't mind pickin' up a little.
He induced his sister to go with him--that is, her boy wanted to
go, and so she, not wantin' to be left alone, concluded to go, too."

"So they went to the Black Hills. Do you think it would be
hard to find them?"

"No; James Harding is a man that's likely to be known wherever
he is. Just go to where the miners are thickest, and I allow
you'll find him."

Luke made inquiries, and ascertaining the best way of reaching
the Black Hills, started the next day.

"If I don't find James Harding, it's because I can't," he said
to himself resolutely.



CHAPTER XXXI

TONY DENTON'S CALL


Leaving Luke on his way to the Black Hills, we will go back to
Groveton, to see how matters are moving on there.

Tony Denton had now the excuse he sought for calling upon Prince
Duncan. Ostensibly, his errand related to the debt which Randolph
had incurred at his saloon, but really he had something more
important to speak of. It may be remarked that Squire Duncan, who
had a high idea of his own personal importance, looked upon Denton
as a low and insignificant person, and never noticed him when they
met casually in the street. It is difficult to play the part of an
aristocrat in a country village, but that is the role which Prince
Duncan assumed. Had he been a prince in reality, as he was by name,
he could not have borne himself more loftily when he came face to
face with those whom he considered his inferiors.

When, in answer to the bell, the servant at Squire Duncan's
found Tony Denton standing on the doorstep, she looked at him
in surprise.

"Is the squire at home?" asked the saloon keeper.

"I believe so," said the girl, doubtfully.

"I would like to see him. Say Mr. Denton wishes to see him on
important business."

The message was delivered.

"Mr. Denton!" repeated the squire, in surprise. "Is it Tony Denton?"

"Yes, sir."

"What can he wish to see me about?"

"He says it's business of importance, sir."

"Well, bring him in."

Prince Duncan assumed his most important attitude and bearing when
his visitor entered his presence.

"Mr.--ahem!--Denton, I believe?" he said, as if he found difficulty
in recognizing Tony.

"The same."

"I am--ahem!--surprised to hear that you have any business with me."

"Yet so it is, Squire Duncan," said Tony, not perceptibly overawed
by the squire's grand manner.

"Elucidate it!" said Prince Duncan, stiffly.

"You may not be aware, Squire Duncan, that your son Randolph has
for some time frequented my billiard saloon and has run up a sum of
twenty-seven dollars."

"I was certainly not aware of it. Had I been, I should have
forbidden his going there. It is no proper place for my son
to frequent."

"Well, I don't know about that. It's respectable enough, I guess.
At any rate, he seemed to like it, and at his request, for he was
not always provided with money, I trusted him till his bill comes
to twenty-seven dollars--"

"You surely don't expect me to pay it!" said the squire, coldly.
"He is a minor, as you very well know, and when you trusted him
you knew you couldn't legally collect your claim."

"Well, squire, I thought I'd take my chances," said Tony,
carelessly. "I didn't think you'd be willing to have him owing
bills around the village. You're a gentleman, and I was sure
you'd settle the debt."

"Then, sir, you made a very great mistake. Such bills as that I do
not feel called upon to pay. Was it all incurred for billiards?"

"No; a part of it was for drinks."

"Worse and worse! How can you have the face to come here, Mr.
Denton, and tell me that?"

"I don't think it needs any face, squire. It's an honest debt."

"You deliberately entrapped my son, and lured him into your saloon,
where he met low companions, and squandered his money and time in
drinking and low amusements."

"Come, squire, you're a little too fast. Billiards ain't low. Did
you ever see Schaefer and Vignaux play?"

"No, sir; I take no interest in the game. In coming here you
have simply wasted your time. You will get no money from me."

"Then you won't pay your son's debt?" asked Tony Denton.

"No."

Instead of rising to go, Tony Denton kept his seat. He regarded
Squire Duncan attentively.

"I am sorry, sir," said Prince Duncan, impatiently. "I shall have
to cut short this interview."

"I will detain you only five minutes, sir. Have you ascertained
who robbed the bank?"

"I have no time for gossip. No, sir."

"I suppose you would welcome any information on the subject?"
