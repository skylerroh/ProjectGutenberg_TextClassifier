There Is A Reaper ...

_By Charles V. De Vet_


     Doctors had given him just one month to
 live. A month to wonder, what comes afterward?
 There was one way to find out--ask a dead man!


The amber brown of the liquor disguised the poison it held, and I
watched with a smile on my lips as he drank it. There was no pity in my
heart for him. He was a jackal in the jungle of life, and I ... I was
one of the carnivores. It is the lot of the jackals of life to be
devoured by the carnivore.

Suddenly the contented look on his face froze into a startled stillness.
I knew he was feeling the first savage twinge of the agony that was to
come. He turned his head and looked at me, and I saw suddenly that he
knew what I had done.

"You murderer!" he cursed me, and then his body arched in the middle and
his voice choked off deep in his throat.
