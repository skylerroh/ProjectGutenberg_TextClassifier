      Jove! how arduous, how divinely learned!

      Therefore welcome it, yours the little outcast,
      This slight volume. O yet, supreme awarder,
    Virgin, save it in ages on for ever.                              10


II.

    Sparrow, favourite of my own beloved,
      Whom to play with, or in her arms to fondle,
      She delighteth, anon with hardy-pointed
    Finger angrily doth provoke to bite her:

    When my lady, a lovely star to long for,                           5
      Bends her splendour awhile to tricksy frolic;
      Peradventure a careful heart beguiling,
    Pardie, heavier ache perhaps to lighten;

    Might I, like her, in happy play caressing
      Thee, my dolorous heart awhile deliver!                         10
        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .
      I would joy, as of old the maid rejoiced
      Racing fleetly, the golden apple eyeing,
    Late-won loosener of the wary girdle.


III.

    Weep each heavenly Venus, all the Cupids,
    Weep all men that have any grace about ye.
    Dead the sparrow, in whom my love delighted,
    The dear sparrow, in whom my love delighted.

    Yea, most precious, above her eyes, she held him,                  5
      Sweet, all honey: a bird that ever hail'd her
      Lady mistress, as hails the maid a mother.

      Nor would move from her arms away: but only
      Hopping round her, about her, hence or hither,
    Piped his colloquy, piped to none beside her.                     10

    Now he wendeth along the mirky pathway,
    Whence, they tell us, is hopeless all returning.

    Evil on ye, the shades of evil Orcus,
      Shades all beauteous happy things devouring,
      Such a beauteous happy bird ye took him.                        15

      Ah! for pity; but ah! for him the sparrow,
      Our poor sparrow, on whom to think my lady's
    Eyes do angrily redden all a-weeping.

1.

    The puny pinnace yonder you, my friends, discern,
      Of every ship professes agilest to be.
      Nor yet a timber o'er the waves alertly flew
      She might not aim to pass it; oary-wing'd alike
      To fleet beyond them, or to scud beneath a sail.                 5

    Nor here presumes denial any stormy coast
      Of Adriatic or the Cyclad orbed isles,
      A Rhodos immemorial, or that icy Thrace,
      Propontis, or the gusty Pontic ocean-arm,

    Whereon, a pinnace after, in the days of yore                     10
      A leafy shaw she budded; oft Cytorus' height
      With her did inly whisper airy colloquy.

2.

    Amastris, you by Pontus, you, the box-clad hill
      Of high Cytorus, all, the pinnace owns, to both
      Was ever, is familiar; in the primal years                      15
      She stood upon your hoary top, a baby tree,
      Within your haven early dipt a virgin oar:

    To carry thence a master o'er the surly seas,
      A world of angry water, hail'd to left, to right
      The breeze of invitation, or precisely set                      20
      The sheets together op'd to catch a kindly Jove.

    Nor yet of any power whom the coasts adore
      Was heard a vow to soothe them, all the weary way
      From outer ocean unto glassy quiet here.

    But all the past is over; indolently now                          25
    She rusts, a life in autumn, and her age devotes
    To Castor and with him ador'd, the twin divine.


V.

    Living, Lesbia, we should e'en be loving.
    Sour severity, tongue of eld maligning,
    All be to us a penny's estimation.

    Suns set only to rise again to-morrow.
    We, when sets in a little hour the brief light,                    5
    Sleep one infinite age, a night for ever.

    Thousand kisses, anon to these an hundred,
    Thousand kisses again, another hundred,
    Thousand give me again, another hundred.

    Then once heedfully counted all the thousands,                    10
    We'll uncount them as idly; so we shall not
    Know, nor traitorous eye shall envy, knowing
    All those myriad happy many kisses.


VI.

    But that, Flavius, hardly nice or honest
      This thy folly, methinks Catullus also
      E'en had known it, a whisper had betray'd thee.

    Some she-malady, some unhealthy wanton,
      Fires thee verily: thence the shy denial.                        5

    Least, you keep not a lonely night of anguish;
      Quite too clamorous is that idly-feigning
      Couch, with wreaths, with a Syrian odour oozing;
      Then that pillow alike at either utmost
      Verge deep-dinted asunder, all the trembling                    10
      Play, the strenuous unsophistication;
      All, O prodigal, all alike betray thee.

    Why? sides shrunken, a sullen hip disabled,
      Speak thee giddy, declare a misdemeanour.

    So, whatever is yours to tell or ill or                           15
      Good, confess it. A witty verse awaits thee
      And thy lady, to place ye both in heaven.


VII.

    Ask me, Lesbia, what the sum delightful
    Of thy kisses, enough to charm, to tire me?

    Multitudinous as the grains on even
    Lybian sands aromatic of Cyrene;

    'Twixt Jove's oracle in the sandy desert                           5
    And where royally Battus old reposeth;

    Yea a company vast as in the silence
    Stars which stealthily gaze on happy lovers;

    E'en so many the kisses I to kiss thee
    Count, wild lover, enough to charm, to tire me;                   10

    These no curious eye can wholly number,
    Tongue of jealousy ne'er bewitch nor harm them.


VIII.

    Ah poor Catullus, learn to play the fool no more.
      Lost is the lost, thou know'st it, and the past is past.

    Bright once the days and sunny shone the light on thee,
      Still ever hasting where she led, the maid so fair,
      By me belov'd as maiden is belov'd no more.                      5

      Was then enacting all the merry mirth wherein
      Thyself delighted, and the maid she said not nay.
    Ah truly bright and sunny shone the days on thee.

    Now she resigns thee; child, do thou resign no less,
    Nor follow her that flies thee, or to bide in woe                 10
    Consent, but harden all thy heart, resolve, endure.

    Farewell, my love. Catullus is resolv'd, endures,
      He will not ask for pity, will not importune.

    But thou'lt be mourning thus to pine unask'd alway.
      O past retrieval faithless! Ah what hours are thine!            15
      When comes a likely wooer? who protests thou'rt fair?

      Who brooks to love thee? who decrees to live thine own?
      Whose kiss delights thee? whose the lips that own thy bite?
    Yet, yet, Catullus, learn to bear, resolve, endure.


IX.

    Dear Veranius, you of all my comrades
      Worth, you only, a many goodly thousands,

      Speak they truly that you your hearth revisit,
    Brothers duteous, homely mother aged?

    Yes, believe them. O happy news, Catullus!                         5

    I shall see him alive, alive shall hear him,
      Tribes Iberian, uses, haunts, declaring

      As his wont is; on him my neck reclining
    Kiss his flowery face, his eyes delightful.

    Now, all men that have any mirth about you,                       10
    Know ye happier any, any blither?


X.

    In the Forum as I was idly roaming
    Varus took me a merry dame to visit.
    She a lady, methought upon the moment,
    Of some quality, not without refinement.

1.

    So, arrived, in a trice we fell on endless                         5
      Themes colloquial; how the fact, the falsehood
      With Bithynia, what the case about it,
      Had it helped me to profit or to money.

    Then I told her a very truth; no atom
      There for company, praetor, hungry natives,                     10
      Home might render a body aught the fatter:

    Then our praetor a castaway, could hugely
      Mulct his company, had a taste to jeer them.

2.

    Spoke another, 'Yet anyways, to bear you
      Men were ready, enough to grace a litter.                       15
      They grow quantities, if report belies not.'
      Then supremely myself to flaunt before her,

    I 'So thoroughly could not angry fortune
      Spite, I might not, afflicted in my province,
      Get erected a lusty eight to bear me.                           20

    But so scrubby the poor sedan, the batter'd
      Frame-work, nobody there nor here could ever
      Lift it, painfully neck to nick adjusting.'

3.

    Quoth the lady, belike a lady wanton,
      'Just for courtesy, lend me, dear Catullus,                     25
      Those same nobodies. I the great Sarapis
      Go to visit awhile.' Said I in answer,

    'Thanks; but, lady, for all my easy boasting,
      'Twas too summary; there's a friend who knows me,
      Cinna Gaius, his the sturdy bearers.                            30

    'Mine or Cinna's, an inch alone divides us,
      I use Cinna's, as e'en my own possession.
      But you're really a bore, a very tiresome
      Dame unmannerly, thus to take me napping.'


XI.

    Furius and Aurelius, O my comrades,
    Whether your Catullus attain to farthest
    Ind, the long shore lash'd by reverberating
                    Surges Eoan;
    Hyrcan or luxurious horde Arabian,                                 5
    Sacan or grim Parthian arrow-bearer,
    Fields the rich Nile discolorates, a seven-fold
                    River abounding;
    Whether o'er high Alps he afoot ascending
    Track the long records of a mighty Caesar,                         10
    Rhene, the Gauls' deep river, a lonely Britain
                    Dismal in ocean;
    This, or aught else haply the gods determine,
    Absolute, you, with me in all to part not;
    Bid my love greet, bear her a little errand,                      15
                    Scarcely of honour.
    Say 'Live on yet, still given o'er to nameless
    Lords, within one bosom, a many wooers,
    Clasp'd, as unlov'd each, so in hourly change all
                    Lewdly disabled.                                  20
    'Think not henceforth, thou, to recal Catullus'
    Love; thy own sin slew it, as on the meadow's
    Verge declines, ungently beneath the plough-share
                    Stricken, a flower.'


XII.

    Marrucinian Asinius, hardly civil
      Left-hand practices o'er the merry wine-cup.
      Watch occasion, anon remove the napkin.
      Call this drollery? Trust me, friend, it is not.
      'Tis most beastly, a trick among a thousand.                     5

    Not believe me? believe a friendly brother,
      Laughing Pollio; he declares a talent
      Poor indemnification, he the parlous
      Child of voluble humour and facetious.

    So face hendecasyllables, a thousand,                             10
      Or most speedily send me back the napkin;
      Gift not prized at a sorry valuation,
      But for company; 'twas a friend's memento.

    Cloth of Saetabis, exquisite, from utmost
      Iber, sent as a gift to me Fabullus                             15
      And Veranius. Ought not I to love them
      As Veranius even, as Fabullus?


XIII.

    Please kind heaven, in happy time, Fabullus,
      We'll dine merrily, dear my friend, together.

    Promise only to bring, your own, a dinner
      Rich and goodly; withal a lily maiden,
      Wine, and banter, a world of hearty laughing.                    5

    Promise only; betimes we dine, my gentle
      Friend, most merrily; but, for your Catullus--
      Know he boasts but a pouch of empty cobwebs.

    Yet take contrary fee, the quintessential
      Love, or sweeter if aught is, aught supremer,                   10

    Perfume savoury, mine; my love received it
    Gift of every Venus, all the Cupids.

    Would you smell it? a god shall hear Fabullus
    Pray unbody him only nose for ever.


XIV.

    Calvus, save that as eyes thou art beloved,
      I could verily loathe thee for the morning's
      Gift, Vatinius hardly more devoutly.

    Slain with poetry! done to death with abjects!
      O what syllable earn'd it, act allow'd it?                       5
      Gods, your malison on the sorry client
    Sent that rascally rabble of malignants.

    Yet, if, freely to guess, the gift recherche
      Some grammarian, haply Sulla, sent thee;
      I repine not; a dear delight, a triumph                         10
    This, thy drudgery thus to see rewarded.

    Gods! an horrible and a deadly volume!

    Sent so faithfully, friend, to thy Catullus,
      Just to kill him upon a day, the festive,
      Saturnalia, best of all the season.                             15
    Sure, a drollery not without requital.

    For, come dawn, to the cases and the bookshops
      I; there gather a Caesius and Aquinus,
      With Suffenus, in every wretch a poison:
    Such plague-prodigy thy remuneration!                             20

    Now good-morrow! away with evil omen
      Whence ill destiny lamely bore ye, clumsy
      Poet-rabble, an age's execration!


XIVB.

    Readers, any that in the future ever
    Scan my fantasies, haply lay upon me
    Hands adventurous of solicitation--


XV.

    Lend thy bounty to me, to my beloved,
      Kind Aurelius. I do ask a favour

      Fair and lawful; if you did e'er in earnest
      Seek some virginal innocence to cherish,
    Touch not lewdly the mistress of my passion.                       5

    Trust the people; avails not aught to fear them,
      Such, who hourly within the streets repassing,
      Run, good souls, on a busy quest or idle.

    You, you only the free, the felon-hearted,
      Fright me, prodigal you of every virtue.                        10

      Well, let luxury run her heady riot,
      Love flow over; enough abroad to sate thee:
    This one trespass--a tiny boon--presume not.

    But should impious heat or humour headstrong
      Drive thee wilfully, wretch, to such profaning,                 15
      In one folly to dare a double outrage:

    Ah what misery thine; what angry fortune!
      Heels drawn tight to the stretch shall open inward
      Lodgment easy to mullet and to radish.


XVI.

    I'll traduce you, accuse you, and abuse you,
      Soft Aurelius, e'en as easy Furius.
      You that lightly a saucy verse resenting,
    Misconceit me, sophisticate me wanton.

    Know, pure chastity rules the godly poet,                          5
      Rules not poesy, needs not e'er to rule it;
      Charms some verse with a witty grace delightful?
    'Tis voluptuous, impudent, a wanton.

    It shall kindle an icy thought to courage,
      Not boy-fancies alone, but every frozen                         10
      Flank immovable, all amort to pleasure.

      You my kisses, a million happy kisses,
      Musing, read me a silky thrall to softness?
    I'll traduce you, accuse you, and abuse you.


XVII.

1.

    Kind Colonia, fain upon bridge more lengthy to gambol,
      And quite ready to dance amain, fearing only the rotten
      Legs too crazily steadied on planks of old resurrections,
      Lest it plunge to the deep morass, there supinely to welter;
      So surprise thee a sumptuous bridge thy fancy to pleasure,       5
      Passive under a Salian god's most lusty procession;
      This rare favour, a laugh for all time, Colonia, grant me.

    In my township a citizen lives: Catullus adjures thee
      Headlong into the mire below topsy-turvy to drown him.
      Only, where the superfluent lake, the spongy putrescence,       10
      Sinks most murkily flushed, descends most profoundly the bottom.
