to the captive, health to the sick, salvation from sin to [1]
the sinner--and overcometh the world!

Go, and tell what things ye shall see and hear: how
the blind, spiritually and physically, receive sight; how
the lame, those halting between two opinions or hob- [5]
bling on crutches, walk; how the physical and moral
lepers are cleansed; how the deaf--those who, having
ears, hear not, and are afflicted with "tympanum on the
brain"--hear; how the dead, those buried in dogmas
and physical ailments, are raised; that to the poor-- [10]
the lowly in Christ, not the man-made rabbi--the
gospel is preached. Note this: only such as are pure
in spirit, emptied of vainglory and vain knowledge, re-
ceive Truth.

Here ends the colloquy; and a voice from heaven seems [15]
to say, "Come and see."

The nineteenth-century prophets repeat, "Unto us a
son is given."

The shepherds shout, "We behold the appearing of
the star!"--and the pure in heart clap their hands. [20]




Editor's Extracts From Sermon


TEXT: _Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of_
_God._--MATT. xxii. 29.

_The Christian Science Journal_ reported as follows:--

The announcement that the Rev. Mary B. G. Eddy [25]
would speak before the Scientist denomination on the
afternoon of October 26, drew a large audience. Haw-
thorne Hall was densely packed, and many had to go
away unable to obtain seats. The distinguished speaker
began by saying:-- [30]

[Page 169.]

Within Bible pages she had found all the divine Science [1]
she preaches; noticing, all along the way of her researches
therein, that whenever her thoughts had wandered into
the bypaths of ancient philosophies or pagan literatures,
her spiritual insight had been darkened thereby, till [5]
she was God-driven back to the inspired pages. Early
training, through the misinterpretation of the Word,
had been the underlying cause of the long years of in-
validism she endured before Truth dawned upon her
understanding, through right interpretation. With the [10]
understanding of Scripture-meanings, had come physical
rejuvenation. The uplifting of spirit was the upbuild-
ing of the body.

She affirmed that the Scriptures cannot properly be
interpreted in a literal way. The truths they teach must [15]
be spiritually discerned, before their message can be
borne fully to our minds and hearts. That there is a
dual meaning to every Biblical passage, the most eminent
divines of the world have concluded; and to get at the
highest, or metaphysical, it is necessary rightly to read [20]
what the inspired writers left for our spiritual instruction.
The literal rendering of the Scriptures makes them noth-
ing valuable, but often is the foundation of unbelief and
hopelessness. The metaphysical rendering is health and
peace and hope for all. The literal or material reading is [25]
the reading of the carnal mind, which is enmity toward
God, Spirit.

Taking several Bible passages, Mrs. Eddy showed how
beautiful and inspiring are the thoughts when rightly
understood. "Let the dead bury their dead; follow [30]
thou me," was one of the passages explained metaphysi-
cally. In their fullest meaning, those words are salvation

[Page 170.]

from the belief of death, the last enemy to be overthrown; [1]
for by following Christ truly, resurrection and life im-
mortal are brought to us. If we follow him, to us there
can be no dead. Those who know not this, may still
believe in death and weep over the graves of their beloved; [5]
but with him is Life eternal, which never changes to
death. The eating of bread and drinking of wine at the
Lord's supper, merely symbolize the spiritual refresh-
ment of God's children having rightly read His Word,
whose entrance into their understanding is healthful life. [10]
This is the reality behind the symbol.

So, also, she spoke of the hades, or hell of Scripture,
saying, that we make our own heavens and our own hells,
by right and wise, or wrong and foolish, conceptions of
God and our fellow-men. Jesus interpreted all spirit- [15]
ually: "I have bread to eat that ye know not of," he
said. The bread he ate, which was refreshment of divine
strength, we also may all partake of.

The material record of the Bible, she said, is no more
important to our well-being than the history of Europe [20]
and America; but the spiritual application bears upon
our eternal life. The method of Jesus was purely meta-
physical; and no other method is Christian Science. In
the passage recording Jesus' proceedings with the blind
man (Mark viii.) he is said to have spat upon the dust. [25]
Spitting was the Hebrew method of expressing the utmost
contempt. So Jesus is recorded as having expressed
contempt for the belief of material eyes as having any
power to see. Having eyes, ye see not; and ears, ye hear
not, he had just told them. The putting on of hands [30]
mentioned, she explained as the putting forth of power.
"Hand," in Bible usage, often means spiritual power.

[Page 171.]

"His hand is not shortened that it cannot save," can [1]
never be wrested from its true meaning to signify human
hands. Jesus' first effort to realize Truth was not wholly
successful; but he rose to the occasion with the second
attempt, and the blind saw clearly. To suppose that [5]
Jesus did actually anoint the blind man's eyes with his
spittle, is as absurd as to think, according to the report
of some, that Christian Scientists sit in back-to-back
seances with their patients, for the divine power to filter
from vertebrae to vertebrae. When one comes to the age [10]
with spiritual translations of God's messages, expressed
in literal or physical terms, our right action is not to con-
demn and deny, but to "try the spirits" and see what
manner they are of. This does not mean communing
with spirits supposed to have departed from the earth, [15]
but the seeking out of the basis upon which are accom-
plished the works by which the new teacher would prove
his right to be heard. By these signs are the true disciples
of the Master known: the sick are healed; to the poor
the gospel is preached. [20]




Extract From A Sermon Delivered In Boston, January 18, 1885


TEXT: _The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman_
_took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was
            leavened._--MATT.
xiii. 33.

Few people at present know aught of the Science of
mental healing; and so many are obtruding upon the
public attention their ignorance or false knowledge in
the name of Science, that it behooves all clad in the shin-
ing mail to keep bright their invincible armor; to keep [30]

[Page 172.]

their demonstrations modest, and their claims and lives [1]
steadfast in Truth.

Dispensing the Word charitably, but separating the
tares from the wheat, let us declare the positive and
the negative of metaphysical Science; what it is, and [5]
what it is not. Intrepid, self-oblivious Protestants in
a higher sense than ever before, let us meet and defeat
the claims of sense and sin, regardless of the bans or
clans pouring in their fire upon us; and white-winged
charity, brooding over all, shall cover with her feathers [10]
the veriest sinner.

Divine and unerring Mind measures man, until the
three measures be accomplished, and he arrives at
fulness of stature; for "the Lord God omnipotent
reigneth." [15]

Science is divine: it is neither of human origin nor of
human direction. That which is termed "natural science,"
the evidences whereof are taken in by the five personal
senses, presents but a finite, feeble sense of the infinite
law of God; which law is written on the heart, received [20]
through the affections, spiritually understood, and dem-
onstrated in our lives.

This law of God is the Science of mental healing,
spiritually discerned, understood, and obeyed.

Mental Science, and the five personal senses, are at [25]
war; and peace can only be declared on the side of im-
mutable right,--the health, holiness, and immortality
of man. To gain this scientific result, the first and funda-
mental rule of Science must be understood and adhered
to; namely, the oft-repeated declaration in Scripture [30]
that God is good; hence, good is omnipotent and
omnipresent.

[Page 173.]

Ancient and modern philosophy, human reason, or [1]
man's theorems, misstate mental Science, its Principle
and practice. The most enlightened sense herein sees
nothing but a law of matter.

Who has ever learned of the schools that there is but [5]
one Mind, and that this is God, who healeth all our sick-
ness and sins?

Who has ever learned from the schools, pagan phi-
losophy, or scholastic theology, that Science is the law of
Mind and not of matter, and that this law has no relation [10]
to, or recognition of, matter?

Mind is its own great cause and effect. Mind is God,
omnipotent and omnipresent. What, then, of an oppo-
site so-called science, which says that man is both matter
and mind, that Mind is in matter? Can the infinite [15]
be within the finite? And must not man have preexisted
in the All and Only? Does an evil mind exist without
space to occupy, power to act, or vanity to pretend that
it is man?

If God is Mind and fills all space, is everywhere, matter [20]
is nowhere and sin is obsolete. If Mind, God, is all-power
and all-presence, man is not met by another power
and presence, that--obstructing his intelligence--
pains, fetters, and befools him. The perfection of man
is intact; whence, then, is something besides Him that [25]
is not the counterpart but the counterfeit of man's creator?
Surely not from God, for He made man in His own
likeness. Whence, then, is the atom or molecule called
matter? Have attraction and cohesion formed it?
But are these forces laws of matter, or laws of [30]
Mind?

For matter to be matter, it must have been self-created.

[Page 174.]

Mind has no more power to evolve or to create matter [1]
than has good to produce evil. Matter is a misstatement
of Mind; it is a lie, claiming to talk and disclaim against
Truth; idolatry, having other gods; evil, having presence
and power over omnipotence! [5]

Let us have a clearing up of abstractions. Let us
come into the presence of Him who removeth all iniqui-
ties, and healeth all our diseases. Let us attach our sense
of Science to what touches the religious sentiment within
man. Let us open our affections to the Principle that [10]
moves all in harmony,--from the falling of a sparrow
to the rolling of a world. Above Arcturus and his sons,
broader than the solar system and higher than the at-
mosphere of our planet, is the Science of mental
healing. [15]

What is the kingdom of heaven? The abode of Spirit,
the realm of the real. No matter is there, no night is
there--nothing that maketh or worketh a lie. Is this
kingdom afar off? No: it is ever-present here. The
first to declare against this kingdom is matter. Shall [20]
that be called heresy which pleads for Spirit--the All of
God, and His omnipresence?

The kingdom of heaven is the reign of divine Science:
it is a mental state. Jesus said it is within you, and
taught us to pray, "Thy kingdom come;" but he did [25]
not teach us to pray for death whereby to gain heaven.
We do not look into darkness for light. Death can never
usher in the dawn of Science that reveals the spiritual
facts of man's Life here and now.

The leaven which a woman took and hid in three [30]
measures of meal, is Divine Science; the Comforter;
the Holy Ghost that leadeth into all Truth; the "still,

[Page 175.]

small voice" that breathes His presence and power, cast- [1]
ing out error and healing the sick. And woman, the
spiritual idea, takes of the things of God and showeth
them unto the creature, until the whole sense of being
is leavened with Spirit. The three measures of meal [5]
may well be likened to the false sense of life, substance,
and intelligence, which says, I am sustained by bread,
matter, instead of Mind. The spiritual leaven of divine
Science changes this false sense, giving better views of
Life; saying, Man's Life is God; and when this shall [10]
appear, it shall be "the substance of things hoped for."

The measure of Life shall increase by every spiritual
touch, even as the leaven expands the loaf. Man shall
keep the feast of Life, not with the old leaven of the
scribes and Pharisees, neither with "the leaven of malice [15]
and wickedness; but the unleavened bread of sincerity
and truth."

Thus it can be seen that the Science of mental healing
must be understood. There are false Christs that would
"deceive, if it were possible, the very elect," by institut- [20]
ing matter and its methods in place of God, Mind. Their
supposition is, that there are other minds than His; that
one mind controls another; that one belief takes the
place of another. But this ism of to-day has nothing
to do with the Science of mental healing which acquaints [25]
us with God and reveals the one perfect Mind and His
laws.

The attempt to mix matter and Mind, to work by
means of both animal magnetism and divine power, is
literally saying, Have we not in thy name cast out devils, [30]
and done many wonderful works?

But remember God in all thy ways, and thou shalt

[Page 176.]

find the truth that breaks the dream of sense, letting the [1]
harmony of Science that declares _Him_, come in with
healing, and peace, and perfect love.




Sunday Services on July Fourth


EXTEMPORE REMARKS

The great theme so deeply and solemnly expounded
by the preacher, has been exemplified in all ages, but
chiefly in the great crises of nations or of the human race.
It is then that supreme devotion to Principle has espe-
cially been called for and manifested. It is then that we [10]
learn a little more of the nothingness of evil, and more
of the divine energies of good, and strive valiantly for the
liberty of the sons of God.

The day we celebrate reminds us of the heroes and
heroines who counted not their own lives dear to them, [15]
when they sought the New England shores, not as the
flying nor as conquerors, but, steadfast in faith and love,
to build upon the rock of Christ, the true idea of God--
the supremacy of Spirit and the nothingness of matter.
When first the Pilgrims planted their feet on Plymouth [20]
Rock, frozen ritual and creed should forever have melted
away in the fire of love which came down from heaven.
The Pilgrims came to establish a nation in true freedom,
in the rights of conscience.

But what of ourselves, and our times and obligations? [25]
Are we duly aware of our own great opportunities and
responsibilities? Are we prepared to meet and improve
them, to act up to the acme of divine energy wherewith
we are armored?

[Page 177.]

Never was there a more solemn and imperious call [1]
than God makes to us all, right here, for fervent de-
votion and an absolute consecration to the greatest and
holiest of all causes. The hour is come. The great
battle of Armageddon is upon us. The powers of evil [5]
are leagued together in secret conspiracy against the
Lord and against His Christ, as expressed and opera-
tive in Christian Science. Large numbers, in desperate
malice, are engaged day and night in organizing action
against us. Their feeling and purpose are deadly, and [10]
they have sworn enmity against the lives of our standard-
bearers.

What will you do about it? Will you be equally in
earnest for the truth? Will you doff your lavender-kid
zeal, and become real and consecrated warriors? Will [15]
you give yourselves wholly and irrevocably to the great
work of establishing the truth, the gospel, and the Science
which are necessary to the salvation of the world from
error, sin, disease, and death? Answer at once and practi-
cally, and answer aright! [20]




Easter Services


The editor of _The Christian Science Journal_ said that
at three o'clock, the hour for the church service proper,
the pastor, Rev. Mary Baker G. Eddy, accompanied
by Rev. D. A. Easton, who was announced to preach [25]
the sermon, came on the platform. The pastor introduced
Mr. Easton as follows:--

_Friends_:--The homesick traveller in foreign lands
greets with joy a familiar face. I am constantly home-
sick for heaven. In my long journeyings I have met [30]

[Page 178.]

one who comes from the place of my own sojourning [1]
for many years,--the Congregational Church. He is
a graduate of Bowdoin College and of Andover The-
ological School. He has left his old church, as I did,
from a yearning of the heart; because he was not sat- [5]
isfied with a manlike God, but wanted to become a God-
like man. He found that the new wine could not be
put into old bottles without bursting them, and he came
to us.

Mr. Easton then delivered an interesting discourse [10]
from the text, "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek
those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the
right hand of God" (Col. iii. 1), which he prefaced by
saying:--

"I think it was about a year ago that I strayed into [15]
this hall, a stranger, and wondered what sort of people
you were, and of what you were worshippers. If any
one had said to me that to-day I should stand before
you to preach a sermon on Christian Science, I should
have replied, "Much learning"--or something else-- [20]
"hath made thee mad." If I had not found Christian
Science a new gospel, I should not be standing before you:
if I had not found it truth, I could not have stood up
again _to_ preach, here or elsewhere."

At the conclusion of the sermon, the pastor again came [25]
forward, and added the following:--

My friends, I wished to be excused from speaking
to-day, but will yield to circumstances. In the flesh, we
are as a partition wall between the old and the new;
between the old religion in which we have been educated, [30]
and the new, living, impersonal Christ-thought that has
been given to the world to-day.

[Page 179.]

The old churches are saying, "He is not here;" and, [1]
"Who shall roll away the stone?"

The stone has been rolled away by human suffer-
ing. The first rightful desire in the hour of loss, when
believing we have lost sight of Truth, is to know where [5]
He is laid. This appeal resolves itself into these
questions:--

Is our consciousness in matter or in God? Have we
any other consciousness than that of good? If we have,
He is saying to us to-day, "Adam, where art thou?" We [10]
are wrong if our consciousness is in sin, sickness, and
death. This is the old consciousness.

In the new religion the teaching is, "He is not here;
Truth is not in matter; he is risen; Truth has become
more to us,--more true, more spiritual." [15]

Can we say this to-day? Have we left the conscious-
ness of sickness and sin for that of health and
holiness?

What is it that seems a stone between us and the
resurrection morning? [20]

It is the belief of mind in matter. We can only come
into the spiritual resurrection by quitting the old con-
sciousness of Soul in sense.

These flowers are floral apostles. God does all this
through His followers; and He made every flower in [25]
Mind before it sprang from the earth: yet we look into
matter and the earth to give us these smiles of God!

We must lay aside material consciousness, and then
we can perceive Truth, and say with Mary, "Rabboni!"
--Master! [30]

In 1866, when God revealed to me this risen Christ,
this Life that knows no death, that saith, "Because he

[Page 180.]

lives, I live," I awoke from the dream of Spirit in the [1]
flesh so far as to take the side of Spirit, and strive to cease
my warfare.

When, through this consciousness, I was delivered from
the dark shadow and portal of death, my friends were [5]
frightened at beholding me restored to health.

A dear old lady asked me, "How is it that you are
restored to us? Has Christ come again on earth?"

"Christ never left," I replied; "Christ is Truth, and
Truth is always here,--the impersonal Saviour." [10]

Then another person, more material, met me, and I
said, in the words of my Master, "Touch me not." I
shuddered at her material approach; then my heart went
out to God, and I found the open door from this sepulchre
of matter. [15]

I _love_ the Easter service: it speaks to me of Life, and
not of death.

Let us do our work; then we shall have part in his
resurrection.




Bible Lessons


_But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the_
_sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were born,_
_not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
            of_
_God._--JOHN i. 12, 13.

Here, the apostle assures us that man has power to [25]
become the son of God. In the Hebrew text, the word
"son" is defined variously; a month is called the son
of a year. This term, as applied to man, is used in both
a material and a spiritual sense. The Scriptures speak
of Jesus as the Son of God and the Son of man; but [30]

[Page 181.]

Jesus said to call no man father; "for one is your Father," [1]
even God.

Is man's spiritual sonship a personal gift to man, or
is it the reality of his being, in divine Science? Man's
knowledge of this grand verity gives him power to dem- [5]
onstrate his divine Principle, which in turn is requisite
in order to understand his sonship, or unity with God,
good. A personal requirement of blind obedience to
the law of being, would tend to obscure the order of
Science, unless that requirement should express the claims [10]
of the divine Principle. Infinite Principle and infinite
Spirit must be one. What avail, then, to quarrel over
what is the person of Spirit,--if we recognize infinitude
as personality,--for who can tell what is the form of
infinity? When we understand man's true birthright, that [15]
he is "born, not ... of the will of the flesh, nor of the
will of man, but of God," we shall understand that man
is the offspring of Spirit, and not of the flesh; recognize
him through spiritual, and not material laws; and regard
him as spiritual, and not material. His sonship, referred [20]
to in the text, is his spiritual relation to Deity: it is not,
then, a personal gift, but is the order of divine Science.
The apostle urges upon our acceptance this great fact:
"But as many as received him, to them gave he power
to become the sons of God." Mortals will lose their sense [25]
of mortality--disease, sickness, sin, and death--in
the proportion that they gain the sense of man's spirit-
ual preexistence as God's child; as the offspring of
good, and not of God's opposite,--evil, or a fallen
man. [30]

John the Baptist had a clear discernment of divine
Science: being born not of the human will or flesh, he

[Page 182.]

antedated his own existence, began spiritually instead [1]
of materially to reckon himself logically; hence the im-
possibility of putting him to death, only in belief, through
violent means or material methods.

"As many as received him;" that is, as many as per-
ceive man's actual existence in and of his divine Princi- [5]
ple, receive the Truth of existence; and these have no
other God, no other Mind, no other origin; therefore, in
time they lose their false sense of existence, and find
their adoption with the Father; to wit, the redemption [10]
of the body. Through divine Science man gains the
power to become the son of God, to recognize his perfect
and eternal estate.

"Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of
the flesh." This passage refers to man's primal, spirit- [15]
ual existence, created neither from dust nor carnal desire.
"Nor of the will of man." Born of no doctrine,
no human faith, but beholding the truth of being; even
the understanding that man was never lost in Adam,
since he is and ever was the image and likeness of God, [20]
good. But no mortal hath seen the spiritual man, more
than he hath seen the Father. The apostle indicates
no personal plan of a personal Jehovah, partial and finite;
but the possibility of all finding their place in God's great
love, the eternal heritage of the Elohim, His sons and [25]
daughters. The text is a metaphysical statement of existence
as Principle and idea, wherein man and his Maker
are inseparable and eternal.

When the Word is made flesh,--that is, rendered
practical,--this eternal Truth will be understood; and [30]
sickness, sin, and death will yield to it, even as they did
more than eighteen centuries ago. The lusts of the flesh

[Page 183.]

and the pride of life will then be quenched in the divine [1]
Science of being; in the ever-present good, omnipotent
Love, and eternal Life, that know no death, In the great
forever, the verities of being exist, and must be acknowl-
edged and demonstrated. Man must love his neighbor [5]
as himself, and the power of Truth must be seen and
felt in health, happiness, and holiness: then it will be
found that Mind is All-in-all, and there is no matter to
cope with.

Man is free born: he is neither the slave of sense, nor a [10]
silly ambler to the so-called pleasures and pains of self-
conscious matter. Man is God's image and likeness;
