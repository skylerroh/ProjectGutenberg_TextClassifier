    _A trumpet-tooter in love can be a wonderful sight, if Local 802
    will forgive our saying so; when extraterrestrials get involved
    too--oh brother! V. R. Francis, who lives in California and has

 This was love, and what could be done about it?
 It's been happening to guys for a long time, now.


Hotlips Grogan may not be as handsome and good-looking like me or as
brainy and intellectual, but in this fiscal year of 2056 he is the
gonest trumpet-tooter this side of Alpha Centauri. You would know what I
mean right off if you ever hear him give out with "Stars Fell on Venus,"
or "Martian Love Song," or "Shine On, Harvest Luna." Believe me, it is
out of this world. He is not only hot, he is radioactive. On a clear day
he is playing notes you cannot hear without you are wearing special
equipment.

That is for a fact.

Mostly he is a good man--cool, solid, and in the warp. But one night he
is playing strictly in three or four wrong keys.

I am the ivory man for this elite bunch of musicians, and I am scooping
up my three-dee music from the battered electronic eighty-eight when he
comes over looking plenty worried.

"Eddie," he says, "I got a problem."

"You got a problem, all right," I tell him. "You are not getting a job
selling Venusian fish, the way you play today."

He frowns. "It is pretty bad, I suppose."

"Bad is not the word," I say, but I spare his feelings and do not say
the word it is. "What gives?"

He looks around him, careful to see if anybody in the place is close
enough to hear. But it is only afternoon rehearsal on the gambling ship
_Saturn_, and the waiters are busy mopping up the floor and leaning on
their long-handled sterilizers, and the boys in the band are picking up
their music to go down to Earth to get some shut-eye or maybe an atomic
beer or two before we open that night.

Hotlips Grogan leans over and whispers in my ear. "It is the thrush," he
says.

"The thrush?" I say, loud, before he clamps one of his big hands over my
kisser. "The thrush," I say, softer; "you mean the canary?"
