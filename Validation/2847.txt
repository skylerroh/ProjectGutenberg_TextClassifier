of, and, finally, the degree of force or affinity with which the acid
adheres to the base. This immense work has been already begun by Messrs
Bergman, Morveau, Kirwan, and other celebrated chemists, but is hitherto
only in a moderate state of advancement, even the principles upon which
it is founded are not perhaps sufficiently accurate.

These numerous details would have swelled this elementary treatise to
much too great a size; besides that, to have gathered the necessary
materials, and to have completed all the series of experiments
requisite, must have retarded the publication of this book for many
years. This is a vast field for employing the zeal and abilities of
young chemists, whom I would advise to endeavour rather to do well than
to do much, and to ascertain, in the first place, the composition of the
acids, before entering upon that of the neutral salts. Every edifice
which is intended to resist the ravages of time should be built upon a
sure foundation; and, in the present state of chemistry, to attempt
discoveries by experiments, either not perfectly exact, or not
sufficiently rigorous, will serve only to interrupt its progress,
instead of contributing to its advancement.

FOOTNOTES:

[33] This number excludes all triple salts, or such as contain more than
one salifiable base, all the salts whose bases are over or under
saturated with acid, and those formed by the nitro-muriatic acid.--E.

[34] As all the specific names of the acids in the new nomenclature are
adjectives, they would have applied severally to the various salifiable
bases, without the invention of other terms, with perfect distinctness.
Thus, _sulphurous potash_, and _sulphuric potash_, are equally distinct
as _sulphite of potash_, and _sulphat of potash_; and have the advantage
of being more easily retained in the memory, because more naturally
arising from the acids themselves, than the arbitrary terminations
adopted by Mr Lavoisier.--E.

[35] There is yet a third degree of oxygenation of acids, as the
oxygenated muriatic and oxygenated nitric acids. The terms applicable to
the neutral salts resulting from the union of these acids with
salifiable bases is supplied by the Author in the Second Part of this
Work. These are formed by prefixing the word _oxygenated_ to the name of
the salt produced by the second degree of oxygenation. Thus,
_oxygenated_ muriat of potash, _oxygenated_ nitrat of soda, &c.--E.

INTRODUCTION.


If I had strictly followed the plan I at first laid down for the conduct
of this work, I would have confined myself, in the Tables and
accompanying observations which compose this Second Part, to short
definitions of the several known acids, and abridged accounts of the
processes by which they are obtainable, with a mere nomenclature or
enumeration of the neutral salts which result from the combination of
these acids with the various salifiable bases. But I afterwards found
that the addition of similar Tables of all the simple substances which
enter into the composition of the acids and oxyds, together with the
various possible combinations of these elements, would add greatly to
the utility of this work, without being any great increase to its size.
These additions, which are all contained in the twelve first sections of
this Part, and the Tables annexed to these, form a kind of
recapitulation of the first fifteen Chapters of the First Part: The rest
of the Tables and Sections contain all the saline combinations.

It must be very apparent that, in this Part of the Work, I have borrowed
greatly from what has been already published by Mr de Morveau in the
First Volume of the _Encyclopedie par ordre des Matieres_. I could
hardly have discovered a better source of information, especially when
the difficulty of consulting books in foreign languages is considered. I
make this general acknowledgment on purpose to save the trouble of
references to Mr de Morveau's work in the course of the following part
of mine.

SECT. I.--_Observations upon the Table of Simple Substances._

The principle object of chemical experiments is to decompose natural
bodies, so as separately to examine the different substances which enter
into their composition. By consulting chemical systems, it will be found
that this science of chemical analysis has made rapid progress in our
own times. Formerly oil and salt were considered as elements of bodies,
whereas later observation and experiment have shown that all salts,
instead of being simple, are composed of an acid united to a base. The
bounds of analysis have been greatly enlarged by modern discoveries[36];
the acids are shown to be composed of oxygen, as an acidifying principle
common to all, united in each to a particular base. I have proved what
Mr Haffenfratz had before advanced, that these radicals of the acids
are not all simple elements, many of them being, like the oily
principle, composed of hydrogen and charcoal. Even the bases of neutral
salts have been proved by Mr Berthollet to be compounds, as he has shown
that ammoniac is composed of azote and hydrogen.

Thus, as chemistry advances towards perfection, by dividing and
subdividing, it is impossible to say where it is to end; and these
things we at present suppose simple may soon be found quite otherwise.
All we dare venture to affirm of any substance is, that it must be
considered as simple in the present state of our knowledge, and so far
as chemical analysis has hitherto been able to show. We may even presume
that the earths must soon cease to be considered as simple bodies; they
are the only bodies of the salifiable class which have no tendency to
unite with oxygen; and I am much inclined to believe that this proceeds
from their being already saturated with that element. If so, they will
fall to be considered as compounds consisting of simple substances,
perhaps metallic, oxydated to a certain degree. This is only hazarded as
a conjecture; and I trust the reader will take care not to confound what
I have related as truths, fixed on the firm basis of observation and
experiment, with mere hypothetical conjectures.

The fixed alkalies, potash, and soda, are omitted in the foregoing
Table, because they are evidently compound substances, though we are
ignorant as yet what are the elements they are composed of.

and frequently phosphorus. { Sebacic.              }
                           { Lithic.               }
                           { Prussic.              }

_Note._--The radicals from the vegetable kingdom are converted by a
first degree of oxygenation into vegetable oxyds, such as sugar, starch,
and gum or mucus: Those of the animal kingdom by the same means form
animal oxyds, as lymph, &c.--A.


SECT. II.--_Observations upon the Table of Compound Radicals._

The older chemists being unacquainted with the composition of acids, and
not suspecting them to be formed by a peculiar radical or base for each,
united to an acidifying principle or element common to all, could not
consequently give any name to substances of which they had not the most
distant idea. We had therefore to invent a new nomenclature for this
subject, though we were at the same time sensible that this nomenclature
must be susceptible of great modification when the nature of the
compound radicals shall be better understood[37].

The compound oxydable and acidifiable radicals from the vegetable and
animal kingdoms, enumerated in the foregoing table, are not hitherto
reducible to systematic nomenclature, because their exact analysis is as
yet unknown. We only know in general, by some experiments of my own, and
some made by Mr Hassenfratz, that most of the vegetable acids, such as
the tartarous, oxalic, citric, malic, acetous, pyro-tartarous, and
pyromucous, have radicals composed of hydrogen and charcoal, combined
in such a way as to form single bases, and that these acids only differ
from each other by the proportions in which these two substances enter
into the composition of their bases, and by the degree of oxygenation
which these bases have received. We know farther, chiefly from the
experiments of Mr Berthollet, that the radicals from the animal kingdom,
and even some of those from vegetables, are of a more compound nature,
and, besides hydrogen and charcoal, that they often contain azote, and
sometimes phosphorus; but we are not hitherto possessed of sufficiently
accurate experiments for calculating the proportions of these several
substances. We are therefore forced, in the manner of the older
chemists, still to name these acids after the substances from which they
are procured. There can be little doubt that these names will be laid
aside when our knowledge of these substances becomes more accurate and
extensive; the terms _hydro-carbonous_, _hydro-carbonic_,
_carbono-hydrous_, and _carbono hydric_[38], will then become
substituted for those we now employ, which will then only remain as
testimonies of the imperfect state in which this part of chemistry was
transmitted to us by our predecessors.

It is evident that the oils, being composed of hydrogen and charcoal
combined, are true carbono-hydrous or hydro-carbonous radicals; and,
indeed, by adding oxygen, they are convertible into vegetable oxyds and
acids, according to their degrees of oxygenation. We cannot, however,
affirm that oils enter in their entire state into the composition of
vegetable oxyds and acids; it is possible that they previously lose a
part either of their hydrogen or charcoal, and that the remaining
ingredients no longer exist in the proportions necessary to constitute
oils. We still require farther experiments to elucidate these points.

Properly speaking, we are only acquainted with one compound radical from
the mineral kingdom, the nitro-muriatic, which is formed by the
combination of azote with the muriatic radical. The other compound
mineral acids have been much less attended to, from their producing less
striking phenomena.


SECT. III.--_Observations upon the Combinations of Light and Caloric
with different Substances._

I have not constructed any table of the combinations of light and
caloric with the various simple and compound substances, because our
conceptions of the nature of these combinations are not hitherto
sufficiently accurate. We know, in general, that all bodies in nature
are imbued, surrounded, and penetrated in every way with caloric, which
fills up every interval left between their particles; that, in certain
cases, caloric becomes fixed in bodies, so as to constitute a part even
of their solid substance, though it more frequently acts upon them with
a repulsive force, from which, or from its accumulation in bodies to a
greater or lesser degree, the transformation of solids into fluids, and
of fluids to aeriform elasticity, is entirely owing. We have employed
the generic name _gas_ to indicate this aeriform state of bodies
produced by a sufficient accumulation of caloric; so that, when we wish
to express the aeriform state of muriatic acid, carbonic acid, hydrogen,
water, alkohol, &c. we do it by adding the word _gas_ to their names;
thus muriatic acid gas, carbonic acid gas, hydrogen gas, aqueous gas,
alkoholic gas, &c.

The combinations of light, and its mode of acting upon different bodies,
is still less known. By the experiments of Mr Berthollet, it appears to
have great affinity with oxygen, is susceptible of combining with it,
and contributes alongst with caloric to change it into the state of gas.
Experiments upon vegetation give reason to believe that light combines
with certain parts of vegetables, and that the green of their leaves,
and the various colours of their flowers, is chiefly owing to this
combination. This much is certain, that plants which grow in darkness
are perfectly white, languid, and unhealthy, and that to make them
recover vigour, and to acquire their natural colours, the direct
influence of light is absolutely necessary. Somewhat similar takes place
even upon animals: Mankind degenerate to a certain degree when employed
in sedentary manufactures, or from living in crowded houses, or in the
narrow lanes of large cities; whereas they improve in their nature and
constitution in most of the country labours which are carried on in the
open air. Organization, sensation, spontaneous motion, and all the
operations of life, only exist at the surface of the earth, and in
places exposed to the influence of light. Without it nature itself would
be lifeless and inanimate. By means of light, the benevolence of the
Deity hath filled the surface of the earth with organization, sensation,
and intelligence. The fable of Promotheus might perhaps be considered as
giving a hint of this philosophical truth, which had even presented
itself to the knowledge of the ancients. I have intentionally avoided
any disquisitions relative to organized bodies in this work, for which
reason the phenomena of respiration, sanguification, and animal heat,
are not considered; but I hope, at some future time, to be able to
elucidate these curious subjects.
