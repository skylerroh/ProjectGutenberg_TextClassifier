                Fathomless, deep is my love
           10   To thee, my passion, my mate.

           The author of this love-song, _mele ipo_, is said to have
           been Kalola, a widow of Kamehameha I, at a time when she was
           an old woman; the place was Lahaina, and the occasion an
           amour between Liholiho (Kamehameha II) and a woman of rank.
           The last two verses of the poem have been omitted from the
           present somewhat free, yet faithful translation, as they do
           not seem to be of interest or pertinent from our point of
           view, and there is internal evidence that they were added as
           an afterthought.

           The hulas on the various islands differed somewhat from one
           another. In general, it may be said that on Kauai they were
           presented with more spirit and in greater variety than in
           other parts of the group. The following account will
           illustrate this fact:

           About the year 1870 the late Queen Emma made the tour of the
           island of Kauai, and at some places the hula was performed as
           a recreation in her honor. The hula ka-laau was thus
           presented; it was marked, however, by such peculiarities as
           to make it hardly recognizable as being the same performance
           as the one elsewhere known by that name. As given on Kauai,
           both the olapa and the hoopaa took part, as they do on the
[Page 119] other islands, but in the Kauai performance the olapa alone
           handled the two sticks of the xylophone, which in other parts
           formed the sole instrument of musical accompaniment to this
           hula. Other striking novelties also were introduced. The
           olapa held between their toes small sticks with which they
           beat upon a resonant beam of wood that lay on the floor, thus
           producing tones of a low pitch. Another departure from the
           usual style of this hula was that the hoopaa, at the same
           time, devoted themselves with the right hand to playing upon
           the pu-niu, the small drum, while with the left they
           developed the deep bass of the pahu. The result of this outre
           combination must have been truly remarkable.

           It is a matter of observation that on the island of Kauai
           both the special features of its spoken language and the
           character of its myths and legends indicate a closer
           relationship to the groups of the southern Pacific, to which
           the Hawaiian people owe their origin, than do those of the
           other islands of the Hawaiian group.

                         XVI.--THE HULA ILI-ILI

           The _hula ili-ili_, pebble-dance, was a performance of the
           classical times, in which, according to one who has witnessed
           it, the olapa alone took part. The dancers held in each hand
           a couple of pebbles, _ili-ili_--hence the name of the
           dance--which they managed to clash against each other, after
           the fashion of castanets, thus producing a rude music of much
           the same quality as that elicited from the "bones" in our
           minstrel performances. According to another witness, the drum
           also was sometimes used in connection with the pebbles as an
           accompaniment to this hula.

           The ili-ili was at times a hula of intensity--that is to say,
           was acted with that stress of voice and manner which the
           Hawaiians termed _ai-ha'a_; but it seems to have been more
           often performed in that quiet natural tone of voice and of
           manner termed _ko'i-honua_, which may be likened to utterance
           in low relief.

           The author can present only the fragment of a song to
           illustrate this hula:

                         _Mele_

                A lalo maua o Wai-pi'o,
                Ike i ka nani o Hi'i-lawe.
                E lawe mai a oki
                I na hala o Naue i ke kai,
            5   I na lehua lu-lu'u pali;
                Noho ana lohe i ke kani o ka o-o,
                Hoolono aku i ka leo o ke kahuli.

                           [Translation]

                              _Song_

                We twain were lodged in Wai-pi'o,
                Beheld Hi'i-lawe, the grand.
                We brought and cut for our love-wreath
                The rich hala drupe from Naue's strand,
            5   Tufted lehua that waves on the cliff;
                Then sat and gave ear to song of o-o,
                Or harked the chirp of the tree-shell.

           _Wai-pi'o_, the scene of this idyl, is a valley deep and
           broad which the elements have scooped out in the windward
           exposure of Hawaii, and scarce needs mention to Hawaiian
[Page 121] tourists. _Hi'i-lawe_ is one of several high waterfalls that
           leap from the world of clouds into the valley-basin.

PUPU-KANI-OE, POETICALLY STYLED KAHULI
HAWAIIAN TREE-SHELLS (ACHATINELLA)]

           _Kahuli_ is a fanciful name applied to the beautiful and
           unique genus of tree-shells (Achatinella), plate XII, that
           inhabit the Hawaiian woods. The natives are persuaded that
           these shells have the power of chirping a song of their own,
           and the writer has often heard the note which they ascribe to
           them; but to his ear it was indistinguishable from the piping
           of the cricket. This is the song that the natives credit to
           the tree-shells:


                  _Mele_

                Kahuli aku,
                Kahuli mai,
                Kahuli lei ula,
                Lei akolea.[255]
            5   Kolea, kolea,[256]
                Ki'i ka wai,
                Wai akolea.

                [Translation]

               _Song of the Tree-shell_

                Trill a-far,
                Trill a-near,
                A dainty song-wreath,
                Wreath akolea.
            5   Kolea, Kolea,
                Fetch me some dew,
                Dew from pink akolea.

           This little piece of rustic imagination is said to have been
           used in the hula, but in connection with what dance the
           author has not been able to learn.

           [Footnote 255: The _akolea_ is a fern (by some classed as a
           Polypodium) which, according to Doctor Hillebrand (Flora of
           the Hawaiian Islands), "sustains its extraordinary length by
           the circinnate tips which twine round the branches of
           neighboring shrubs or trees."]

                         XVII.--THE HULA KA-EKE-EKE


           The _kaekeeke_ was a formal hula worthy of high
           consideration. Some authorities assert that the performers in
           this dance were chosen from the hoopaa alone, who, it will be
           remembered, maintained the kneeling position, while,
           according to another authority, the olapa also took part in
           it. There is no reason for doubting the sincerity of both
           these witnesses. The disagreement probably arose from hasty
           generalization. One is reminded of the wise Hawaiian saw,
           already noted, "Do not think that your halau holds all the
           knowledge."

           This hula took its name from the simple instrument that
           formed its musical accompaniment. This consisted of a single
           division of the long-jointed bamboo indigenous to Hawaii,
           which was left open at one end. (The varieties of bamboo
           imported from China or the East Indies have shorter joints
           and thicker walls, and will not answer the purpose, being not
           sufficiently resonant.) The joints used in the kaekeeke were
           of different sizes and lengths, thus producing tones of
           various pitch. The performer held one in each hand and the
           tone was elicited by striking the base of the cylinder
           sharply against the floor or some firm, nonresonant body.

           On making actual trial of the kaekeeke, in order to prove by
           experience its musical quality and capabilities, the writer's
           pleasure was as great as his surprise when he found it
           capable of producing musical tones of great purity and of the
           finest quality. Experiment soon satisfied him that for the
           best production of the tone it was necessary to strike the
           bamboo cylinder smartly upon some firm, inelastic substance,
           such as a bag of sand. The tone produced was of crystalline
           purity, and by varying the size and length of the cylinders
           it proved possible to represent a complete musical scale. The
           instrument was the germ of the modern organ.

           The first mele to be presented partakes of the nature of the
           allegory, a form of composition not a little affected by the
           Hawaiians:

                          _Mele_

                A Hamakua au,
                Noho i ka ulu hala.
                Malihini au i ka hiki ana,
                I ka ua pe'epe'e pohaku.
            5   Noho oe a li'u-li'u,
                A luli-luli malie iho.
[Page 123]
                He keiki akamai ko ia pali;
                Elima no pua i ka lima.
                Kui oe a lawa
           10   I lei no ku'u aloha;
                Malama malie oe i ka makemake,
                I lei hooheno no ke aloha ole.

                Moe oe a ala mai;
                Nana iho oe i kou pono.
           15   Hai'na ia ka puana:
                Keiki noho pali o Hamakua;
                A waka-waka, a waka-waka.

                      [Translation]

                         _Song_

                It was in Hamakua;
                I sat in a grove of Pandanus,
                A stranger at my arrival,
                A rock was my shelter from rain.
            5   I found it a wearisome wait,
                Cautiously shifting about.

                There's a canny son of the cliff
                That has five buds to his hand.
                You shall twine me a wreath of due length,
           10   A wreath to encircle my love,
                Whilst you hold desire in strong curb,
                Till love-touch thaws the cold-hearted.

                When you rise from sleep on the mat,
                Look down, see the conquest of love.
           15   The meaning of this short story?
                What child fondly clings to the cliff?
                Waka-waka, the shell-fish.

           The scene of this idyl, this love-song, _mele hoipoipo_, is
           Hamakua, a district on the windward side of Hawaii, subject
           to rain-squalls. The poet in his allegory represents himself
           as a stranger sitting in a pandanus grove, _ulu hala_ (verse
           2); sheltering himself from a rain-squall by crouching behind
           a rock, _ua pe'epe'e pohaku_ (verse 4); shifting about on
           account of the veering of the wind, _luli-luli malie iho_
           (verse 6). Interpreting this figuratively, Hamakua, no doubt,
           is the woman in the case; the grove an emblem of her
           personality and physical charms; the rain-squall, of her
           changeful moods and passions. The shifting about of the
           traveler to meet the veering of the wind would seem to mean
           the man's diplomatic efforts to deal with the woman's varying
           caprices and outbursts.

           He now takes up a parable about some creature, a child of the
           cliff--Hamakua's ocean boundary is mostly a precipitous
           wall--which he represents as a hand with five buds.
           Addressing it as a servant, he bids this creature twine a
[Page 124] wreath sufficient for his love, _kui oe a_ _lawa_ (verse 9),
           _I lei no ku'u aloha_ (verse 10). This creature with five
           buds, what is it but the human hand, the errand-carrier of
           man's desire, _makemake_ (verse 11)? The _pali_, by the way,
           is a figure often used by Hawaiian poets to mean the glory
           and dignity of the human body.

           That is a fine imaginative touch in which the poet
           illustrates the power of the human hand to kindle love in one
           that is cold-hearted, as if he had declared the hand itself
           to be not only the wreath-maker, but the very wreath that is
           to encircle and warm into response the unresponsive loved
           one, _I lei hooheno no ke aloha ole_ (verse 12).

           Differences of physical environment, of social convention, of
           accepted moral and esthetic standards interpose seemingly
           impassable barriers between us and the savage mind, but at
           the touch of an all-pervading human sympathy these barriers
           dissolve into very thin air.

                A dark burnished form is Hawaii,
                To one who stands on the mount--
                A hamper swung down from heaven,
           10   A beautiful carven shape is the island--
                Thy mountains, thy splendor of herbage:
                Mauna-kea and Loa stand (in glory) apart,

           This love-song--_mele hoipoipo_--which would be the
           despair of a strict literalist--what is it all about? A
           lover in Kahiki-nui--of the softer sex, it would appear--
           looks across the wind-swept channel and sends her thoughts
           lovingly, yearningly, over to Kona of Hawaii, which district
           she personifies as her lover. The mountains and plains,
           valleys and capes of its landscapes, are to her the parts and
           features of her beloved. Even in the ocean that flows between
           her and him, and which has often covered her nakedness as
           with a robe, she finds a link in the chain of association.

                             XVIII.--AN INTERMISSION


           During the performance of a hula the halau and all the people
           there assembled are under a tabu, the imposition of which was
           accomplished by the opening prayer that had been offered
           before the altar. This was a serious matter and laid everyone
           present under the most formal obligations to commit no breach
           of divine etiquette; it even forbade the most innocent
           remarks and expressions of emotion. But when the performers,
           wearied of the strait-jacket, determined to unbend and
           indulge in social amenities, to lounge, gossip, and sing
           informal songs, to quaff a social bowl of awa, or to indulge
           in an informal dance, they secured the opportunity for this
           interlude, by suspending the tabu. This was accomplished by
           the utterance of a _pule hoo-noa_, a tabu-lifting prayer. If
           the entire force of the tabu was not thus removed, it was at
           least so greatly mitigated that the ordinary conversations of
           life might be carried on without offense. The pule was
           uttered by the kumu or some person who represented the
           whole-company:

                _Pule Hoo-noa_

                Lehua[266] i-luna,
                Lehua i-lalo,

                    _Power to Remove Tabu_

                Bloom of lehua on altar piled,
                Bloom of lehua below,
                Bloom of lehua at altar's base,
                In the month Ka-ulua.
            5   Present here is Haumea,
                And the father of thee,
                And the goddess of eloquent speech;
                Gather, now gather,
                Ye ranks of gods,
           10   And ye ranks of men,
                Complete in array.
                The heavenly service is done,
                Service of Ku of the mount,
                Service of Laka,
           15   And the great god Ku,
                Ku of the wilds,
                And of Hina,
                Hina, the heavenly singer.
                Now it is done,
           20   Our work is done;
                The tabu is lifted,
                Free is the place,
                Tabu-free!

           Here also is another pule hoo-noa, a prayer-song addressed to
           Laka, an intercession for the lifting of the tabu. It will be
           noticed that the request is implied, not explicitly stated.
           All heads are lifted, all eyes are directed heavenward or to
           the altar, and the hands with a noiseless motion keep time as
           the voices of the company, led by the kumu, in solemn
           cantillation, utter the following prayer:
[Page 128]

                   _Pule Hoo-noa no Laka_

                Pupu we'u-we'u[273] e, Laka e,
                O kona we'u-we'u e ku-wa;[274]
                O Ku-ka-ohia-Laka,[275] e;
                Laua me Ku-pulu-pulu;[276]
            5   Ka Lehua me ke Koa lau-lii;
                O ka Lama me Moku-halii,
                Ku-i-ku-i[277] me ka Hala-pepe;
                Lakou me Lau-ka-ie-ie,
                Ka Palai me Maile-lau-lii.
           10   Noa, noa i kou kuahu;
                Noa, noa ia oe, Laka;
                Pa-pa-lua noa!

                           [Translation]

                  _Tabu-lifting Prayer (to Laka)_

                Oh wildwood bouquet, O Laka!
                Set her greenwood leaves in order due;
                And Ku, god of Ohia-La-ka,
                He and Ku, the shaggy,
            5   Lehua with small-leafed Koa,
                And Lama and Moku-hali'i,
                Ku-i-ku-i and Haia-pe-pe;
                And with these leafy I-e-i-e,
                Fern and small-leafed Maile.
           10   Free, the altar is free!
                Free through, you, Laka,
                Doubly free!

           [Footnote 273: _Pupu we'u-we'u_. A bouquet. The reference is to
           the wreaths and floral decorations that bedecked the altar,
           and that were not only offerings to the goddess, but symbols
           of the diverse forms in which she manifested herself. At the
           conclusion of a performance the players laid upon the altar
           the garlands they themselves had worn. These were in addition
           to those which were placed there before the play began.]

           [Footnote 274: _Ku-wa_. It has cost much time and trouble to
           dig out the meaning of this word. The fundamental notion is
           that contained in its two parts, _ku_, to stand, and _wa_, an
           interval or space, the whole meaning to arrange or set in
           orderly intervals.]

           [Footnote 275: _La-ka_. A Tahitian name for the tree which in
           Hawaii is called _lehua_, or _ohia_. In verse 3 the Hawaiian
           name _ohia_ and the Tahitian _laka_ (accented on the final
           syllable, thus distinguishing it from the name of the goddess
           _Laka_, with which it has no discoverable connection) are
           combined in one form as an appellation of the god
           _Ku-ku-ka-ohia-Laka_. This is a notable instance of the
           survival of a word as a sacred epithet in a liturgy, which
           otherwise, had been lost to the language.]

           [Footnote 276: _Ku-pulu-pulu_. Ku, the fuzzy or shaggy, a deity
           much worshiped by canoe-makers, represented as having the
           figure of an old man with a long beard. In the sixth verse
           the full form of the god's name here given as _Moku-ha-li'i_
           would be _Ku-moku-hali'i_, the last part being an epithet
           applied to _Ku_ working in another capacity. _Moku-hali'i_ is
           the one who bedecks the island. His special emblem, as here
           implied, was the _lama_, a beautiful tree, whose wood was
           formerly used in making certain sacred inclosures. From this
           comes the proper name _Palama_, one of the districts of
           Honolulu.]

           [Footnote 277: _Ku-i-ku-i_. The same as the tree now called
           _ku-ku-i_, the tree whose nuts were used as candles and
           flambeaus. The Samoan name of the same tree is _tu-i-tu-i_.]

           But even now, when the tabu has been removed and the assembly
           is supposed to have assumed an informal character, before
           they may indulge themselves in informalities, there remains
           to be chanted a dismissing prayer, _pule hooku'u_, in which
           all voices must join:
