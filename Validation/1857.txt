form.

"Oh," she continued apologetically, "of course there are Dean Swift and
Thomas Moore and Charles Lever."

"And," I added "certain minor authors named Goldsmith, Sterne, Steele,
and Samuel Lover."

"And Bishop Berkeley, and Brinsley Sheridan, and Maria Edgeworth, and
Father Prout," continued Salemina, "and certain great speech-makers like
Burke and Grattan and Curran; and how delightful to visit all the places
connected with Stella and Vanessa, and the spot where Spenser wrote the
Faerie Queene."

     "'Nor own a land on earth but one,
       We're Paddies, and no more,'"

sang Francesca. "You will be telling me in a moment that Thomas Carlyle
was born in Skereenarinka, and that Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet
in Coolagarranoe," for she had drawn the guidebook toward her and made
good use of it. "Let us do the literary pilgrimage, certainly, before
we leave Ireland, but suppose we begin with something less intellectual.
This is the most pugnacious map I ever gazed upon. All the names seem
to begin or end with kill, bally, whack, shock, or knock; no wonder the
Irish make good soldiers! Suppose we start with a sanguinary trip to the
Kill places, so that I can tell any timid Americans I meet in travelling
that I have been to Kilmacow and to Kilmacthomas, and am going to-morrow
to Kilmore, and the next day to Kilumaule."

"I think that must have been said before," I objected.

"It is so obvious that it's not unlikely," she rejoined; "then let
us simply agree to go afterwards to see all the Bally places from
Ballydehob on the south to Ballycastle or Ballymoney on the north,
and from Ballynahinch or Ballywilliam on the east to Ballyvaughan or
Ballybunnion on the west, and passing through, in transit,

     Ballyragget,
     Ballysadare,
     Ballybrophy,
     Ballinasloe,
     Ballyhooley,
     Ballycumber,
     Ballyduff,
     Ballynashee,
     Ballywhack.

Don't they all sound jolly and grotesque?"

"They do indeed," we agreed, "and the plan is quite worthy of you; we
can say no more."

We had now developed so many more ideas than we could possibly use that
the labour of deciding among them was the next thing to be done. Each of
us stood out boldly for her own project,--even Francesca clinging, from
sheer wilfulness, to her worthless and absurd itineraries,--until, in
order to bring the matter to any sort of decision, somebody suggested
that we consult Benella; which reminds me that you have not yet the
pleasure of Benella's acquaintance.



Chapter III. We sight a derelict.

     'O Bay of Dublin, my heart you're troublin',
      Your beauty haunts me like a fever dream.'
                                         Lady Dufferin.

To perform the introduction properly I must go back a day or two. We
had elected to cross to Dublin directly from Scotland, an easy night
journey. Accordingly we embarked in a steamer called the Prince or the
King of something or other, the name being many degrees more princely or
kingly than the craft itself.

We had intended, too, to make our own comparison of the Bay of Dublin
and the Bay of Naples, because every traveller, from Charles Lever's
Jack Hinton down to Thackeray and Mr. Alfred Austin has always made it a
point of honour to do so. We were balked in our conscientious endeavour,
because we arrived at the North Wall forty minutes earlier than the hour
set by the steamship company. It is quite impossible for anything in
Ireland to be done strictly on the minute, and in struggling not to be
hopelessly behind time, a 'disthressful counthry' will occasionally be
ahead of it. We had been told that we should arrive in a drizzling rain,
and that no one but Lady Dufferin had ever on approaching Ireland seen
the 'sweet faces of the Wicklow mountains reflected in a smooth and
silver sea.' The grumblers were right on this special occasion, although
we have proved them false more than once since.

I was in a fever of fear that Ireland would not be as Irish as we wished
it to be. It seemed probable that processions of prosperous aldermen,
school directors, contractors, mayors, and ward politicians, returning
to their native land to see how Herself was getting on, the crathur,
might have deposited on the soil successive layers of Irish-American
virtues, such as punctuality, thrift, and cleanliness, until they had
quite obscured fair Erin's peculiar and pathetic charm. We longed for
the new Ireland as fervently as any of her own patriots, but we wished
to see the old Ireland before it passed. There is plenty of it left
(alas! the patriots would say), and Dublin was as dear and as dirty as
when Lady Morgan first called it so, long years ago. The boat was met
by a crowd of ragged gossoons, most of them barefooted, some of them
stockingless, and in men's shoes, and several of them with flowers in
their unspeakable hats and caps. There were no cabs or jaunting cars
because we had not been expected so early, and the jarveys were in
attendance on the Holyhead steamer. It was while I was searching for a
piece of lost luggage that I saw the stewardess assisting a young woman
off the gang plank, and leading her toward a pile of wool bags on
the dock. She sank helplessly on one of them, and leaned her head on
another. As the night had been one calculated to disturb the physical
equilibrium of a poor sailor, and the breakfast of a character to
discourage the stoutest stomach, I gave her a careless thought of pity
and speedily forgot her. Two trunks, a holdall, a hatbox--in which
reposed, in solitary grandeur, Francesca's picture hat, intended for
the further undoing of the Irish gentry--a guitar case, two bags, three
umbrellas; all were safe but Salemina's large Vuitton trunk and my
valise, which had been last seen at Edinburgh station. Salemina returned
to the boat, while Francesca and I wended our way among the heaps of
luggage, followed by crowds of ragamuffins, who offered to run for a
car, run for a cab, run for a porter, carry our luggage up the street
to the cab-stand, carry our wraps, carry us, 'do any mortial thing for a
penny, melady, an' there is no cars here, melady, God bless me sowl, and
that He be good to us all if I'm tellin' you a word of a lie!'

Entirely unused to this flow of conversation, we were obliged to stop
every few seconds to recount our luggage and try to remember what we
were looking for. We all met finally, and I rescued Salemina from the
voluble thanks of an old woman to whom she had thoughtlessly given a
three-penny bit. This mother of a 'long wake family' was wishing that
Salemina might live to 'ate the hin' that scratched over her grave,
and invoking many other uncommon and picturesque blessings, but we were
obliged to ask her to desist and let us attend to our own business.

"Will I clane the whole of thim off for you for a penny, your ladyship's
honour, ma'am?" asked the oldest of the ragamuffins, and I gladly
assented to the novel proposition. He did it, too, and there seemed to
be no hurt feelings in the company.

Just then there was a rattle of cabs and side-cars, and our
self-constituted major-domo engaged two of them to await our pleasure.
At the same moment our eyes lighted upon Salemina's huge Vuitton, which
had been dragged behind the pile of wool sacks. It was no wonder it
had escaped our notice, for it was mostly covered by the person of the
sea-sick maiden whom I had seen on the arm of the stewardess. She was
seated on it, exhaustion in every line of her figure, her head upon my
travelling bag, her feet dangling over the edge until they just touched
the 'S. P., Salem, Mass., U.S.A.' painted in large red letters on the
end. She was too ill to respond to our questions, but there was no
mistaking her nationality. Her dress, hat, shoes, gloves, face, figure
were American. We sent for the stewardess, who told us that she had
arrived in Glasgow on the day previous, and had been very ill all the
way coming from Boston.

"Boston!" exclaimed Salemina. "Do you say she is from Boston, poor
thing?"

("I didn't know that a person living in Boston could ever, under any
circumstances, be a 'poor thing,'" whispered Francesca to me.)

"She was not fit to be crossing last night, and the doctor on the
American ship told her so, and advised her to stay in bed for three days
before coming to Ireland; but it seems as if she were determined to get
to her journey's end."

"We must have our trunk," I interposed. "Can't we move her carefully
over to the wool sacks, and won't you stay with her until her friends
come?"

"She has no friends in this country, ma'am. She's just travelling for
pleasure like."

"Good gracious! what a position for her to be in," said Salemina. "Can't
you take her back to the steamer and put her to bed?"

"I could ask the captain, certainly, miss, though of course it's
something we never do, and besides we have to set the ship to rights and
go across again this evening."

"Ask her what hotel she is going to, Salemina," we suggested, "and let
us drop her there, and put her in charge of the housekeeper; of course
if it is only sea-sickness she will be all right in the morning."

The girl's eyes were closed, but she opened them languidly as Salemina
chafed her cold hands, and asked gently if we could not drive her to an
hotel.

"Is--this--your--baggage?" she whispered.

"It is," Salemina answered, somewhat puzzled.

"Then don't--leave me here, I am from Salem--myself," whereupon without
any more warning she promptly fainted away on the trunk.

The situation was becoming embarrassing. The assemblage grew larger,
and a more interesting and sympathetic audience I never saw. To an Irish
crowd, always warm-hearted and kindly, willing to take any trouble
for friend or stranger, and with a positive terror of loneliness, or
separation from kith and kin, the helpless creature appealed in every
way. One and another joined the group with a "Holy Biddy! what's this at
all?"

"The saints presarve us, is it dyin' she is?"

"Look at the iligant duds she do be wearin'."

"Call the docthor, is it? God give you sinse! Sure the docthors is only
a flock of omadhauns."

"Is it your daughter she is, ma'am?" (This to Salemina.)

"She's from Ameriky, the poor mischancy crathur."

"Give her a toothful of whisky, your ladyship. Sure it's nayther bite
nor sup she's had the morn, and belike she's as impty as a quarry-hole."

When this last expression from the mother of the long weak family fell
upon Salemina's cultured ears she looked desperate.

We could not leave a fellow-countrywoman, least of all could Salemina
forsake a fellow-citizen, in such a hapless plight.

"Take one cab with Francesca and the luggage, Penelope," she whispered.
"I will bring the girl with me, put her to bed, find her friends,
and see that she starts on her journey safely; it's very awkward, but
there's nothing else to be done."

So we departed in a chorus of popular approval.

"Sure it's you that have the good hearts!"

"May the heavens be your bed!"

"May the journey thrive wid her, the crathur!"

Francesca and I arrived first at the hotel where our rooms were already
engaged, and there proved to be a comfortable little dressing, or
maid's, room just off Salemina's.

Here the Derelict was presently ensconced, and there she lay, in a sort
of profound exhaustion, all day, without once absolutely regaining
her consciousness. Instead of visiting the National Gallery as I had
intended, I returned to the dock to see if I could find the girl's
luggage, or get any further information from the stewardess before she
left Dublin.

"I'll send the doctor at once, but we must learn all possible
particulars now," I said maliciously to poor Salemina. "It would be so
awkward, you know, if you should be arrested for abduction."

The doctor thought it was probably nothing more than the complete
prostration that might follow eight days of sea-sickness, but the
patient's heart was certainly a little weak, and she needed the utmost
quiet. His fee was a guinea for the first visit, and he would drop in
again in the course of the afternoon to relieve our anxiety. We took
turns in watching by her bedside, but the two unemployed ones lingered
forlornly near, and had no heart for sightseeing. Francesca did,
however, purchase opera tickets for the evening, and secretly engaged
the housemaid to act as head nurse in our absence.

As we were dining at seven, we heard a faint voice in the little room
beyond. Salemina left her dinner and went in to find her charge slightly
better. We had been able thus far only to take off her dress, shoes, and
such garments as made her uncomfortable; Salemina now managed to slip on
a nightdress and put her under the bedcovers, returning then to her cold
mutton cutlet.

"She's an extraordinary person," she said, absently playing with her
knife and fork. "She didn't ask me where she was, or show any interest
in her surroundings; perhaps she is still too weak. She said she was
better, and when I had made her ready for bed, she whispered, 'I've got
to say my prayers'.

"'Say them by all means,' I replied.

"'But I must get up and kneel down, she said.

"I told her she must do nothing of the sort; that she was far too ill.

"'But I must,' she urged. 'I never go to bed without saying my prayers
on my knees.'

"I forbade her doing it; she closed her eyes, and I came away. Isn't she
quaint?"

At this juncture we heard the thud of a soft falling body, and rushing
in we found that the Derelict had crept from her bed to her knees, and
had probably not prayed more than two minutes before she fainted for the
fifth or sixth time in twenty-four hours. Salemina was vexed, angel
and philanthropist though she is. Francesca and I were so helpless with
laughter that we could hardly lift the too conscientious maiden into
bed. The situation may have been pathetic; to the truly pious mind it
would indeed have been indescribably touching, but for the moment the
humorous side of it was too much for our self-control. Salemina, in
rushing for stimulants and smelling salts, broke her only comfortable
eyeglasses, and this accident, coupled with her other anxieties
and responsibilities, caused her to shed tears, an occurrence so
unprecedented that Francesca and I kissed and comforted her and tucked
her up on the sofa. Then we sent for the doctor, gave our opera tickets
to the head waiter and chambermaid, and settled down to a cheerful home
evening, our first in Ireland.

"If Himself were here, we should not be in this plight," I sighed.

"I don't know how you can say that," responded Salemina, with
considerable spirit. "You know perfectly well that if your husband had
found a mother and seven children helpless and deserted on that dock,
he would have brought them all to this hotel, and then tried to find the
father and grandfather."

"And it's not Salemina's fault," argued Francesca. "She couldn't help
the girl being born in Salem; not that I believe that she ever heard of
the place before she saw it printed on Salemina's trunk. I told you it
was too big and red, dear, but you wouldn't listen! I am the strongest
American of the party, but I confess that U.S.A. in letters five inches
long is too much for my patriotism."

"It would not be if you ever had charge of the luggage," retorted
Salemina.

"And whatever you do, Francesca," I added beseechingly, "don't impugn
the veracity of our Derelict. While we think of ourselves as ministering
angels I can endure anything, but if we are the dupes of an adventuress,
there is nothing pretty about it. By the way, I have consulted the
English manageress of this hotel, who was not particularly sympathetic.
'Perhaps you shouldn't have assumed charge of her, madam,' she said,
'but having done so, hadn't you better see if you can get her into a
hospital?' It isn't a bad suggestion, and after a day or two we will
consider it, or I will get a trained nurse to take full charge of her.
I would be at any reasonable expense rather than have our pleasure
interfered with any further."

It still seems odd to make a proposition of this kind. In former times,
Francesca was the Croesus of the party, Salemina came second, and I
last, with a most precarious income. Now I am the wealthy one, Francesca
is reduced to the second place, and Salemina to the third, but it makes
no difference whatever, either in our relations, our arrangements, or,
for that matter, in our expenditures.



Chapter IV. Enter Benella Dusenberry.

     'A fair maiden wander'd
        All wearied and lone,
      Sighing, "I'm a poor stranger,
        And far from my own."
      We invited her in,
      We offered her share
      Of our humble cottage
      And our humble fare;
      We bade her take comfort,
      No longer to moan,
      And made the poor stranger
      Be one of our own.'
                      Old Irish Song.

The next morning dawned as lovely as if it had slipped out of Paradise,
and as for freshness, and emerald sheen, the world from our windows was
like a lettuce leaf just washed in dew. The windows of my bedroom looked
out pleasantly on St. Stephen's Green, commonly called Stephen's Green,
or by citizens of the baser sort, Stephens's Green. It is a good English
mile in circumference, and many are the changes in it from the time it
was first laid out, in 1670, to the present day, when it was made into a
public park by Lord Ardilaun.

When the celebrated Mrs. Delany, then Mrs. Pendarves, first saw it, the
centre was a swamp, where in winter a quantity of snipe congregated,
and Harris in his History of Dublin alludes to the presence of snipe
and swamp as an agreeable and uncommon circumstance not to be met with
perhaps in any other great city in the world.

A double row of spreading lime-trees bordered its four sides, one of
which, known as Beaux' Walk, was a favourite lounge for fashionable
idlers. Here stood Bishop Clayton's residence, a large building with a
front like Devonshire House in Piccadilly: so writes Mrs. Delany. It was
splendidly furnished, and the bishop lived in a style which proves that
Irish prelates of the day were not all given to self-abnegation and
mortification of the flesh.

A long line of vehicles, outside-cars and cabs, some of them battered
and shaky, others sufficiently well-looking, was gathering on two sides
of the Green, for Dublin, you know, is 'the car-drivingest city in
the world.' Francesca and I had our first experience yesterday in the
intervals of nursing, driving to Dublin Castle, Trinity College, the
Four Courts, and Grafton Street (the Regent Street of Dublin). It is
easy to tell the stranger, stiff, decorous, terrified, clutching the
rail with one or both hands, but we took for our model a pretty Irish
girl, who looked like nothing so much as a bird on a swaying bough. It
is no longer called the 'jaunting,' but the outside car and there
is another charming word lost to the world. There was formerly an
inside-car too, but it is almost unknown in Dublin, though still found
in some of the smaller towns. An outside-car has its wheels practically
inside the body of the vehicle, but an inside car carries its wheels
outside. This definition was given us by an Irish driver, but lucid
