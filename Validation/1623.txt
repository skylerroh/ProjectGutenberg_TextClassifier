   BLIND
 SPOT

   By BASCOM JONES, JR.

   Illustrated by KOSSIN


 _Everyone supported the Martian
   program--until it struck home!_


Johnny Stark, director of the department of Interplanetary Relations for
Mars' Settlement One, reread the final paragraph of the note which he
had found on his desk, upon returning from lunch earlier in the day.

His eye flicked rapidly over the moistly smeared Martian scrawl,
ignoring the bitterness directed at him in the first paragraphs. He was
vaguely troubled by the last sentences. But he hadn't been able to pin
the feeling down.

    _... Our civilization predates that of Earth's by millions of years.
    We are an advanced, peaceful race. Yet, since Earth's first rocket
    landed here thirteen years ago, we have been looked upon as freaks
    and contemptuously called 'bug-men' behind our backs! This is our
    planet. We gave of our far-advanced knowledge and science freely, so
    that Earth would be a better place. We asked nothing in return, but
    we were rewarded by having forced upon us foreign ideas of
    government, religion, and behavior. Our protests have been silenced
    by an armed-police and punitive system we've never before needed.
    Someday you will awaken to this injustice. On that day in your life,
    you have my sympathy and pity!_
