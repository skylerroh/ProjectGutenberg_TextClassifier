THE DISCOVERY OF A NEW WORLD

CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS. Six years before Vasco da Gama made his
  famous voyage to India around Africa and opened a new trade route for
  the Portuguese merchants, another seaman had formed and carried out a
  much bolder plan. This was Christopher Columbus, and his plan was to
  sail directly west from Europe into the unknown ocean in search of new
  islands and the coast of Asia. Columbus, who was a native of Genoa in
  Italy, had followed his younger brother to Portugal. Both were probably
  led there by the fame of Prince Henry's explorations.

  The brothers became very skilful in making maps and charts for the
  Portuguese. They also frequently sailed with them on their expeditions
  along the coast of Africa. All the early associations of Columbus were
  with men interested in voyages of discovery, and particularly with those
  engaged in the daring search for a sea route to India.

HOW COLUMBUS FORMED HIS PLAN. Columbus gathered all the information
  on geography which he could from ancient writers and from modern
  discoverers. Many of them believed that the world was shaped like a
  ball. If such were its shape, Columbus reasoned, why might not a ship
  sail around it from east to west? Or, better, why not sail directly west
  to India, and perhaps find many wonderful islands between Europe and
  Asia? His imagination was also fired by Marco Polo's description of the
  marvelous riches of China, Japan, and the Spice Islands. But the idea of
  going directly west into the midst of the unknown and seemingly
  boundless waste of water, and on and on to Asia, appeared to most men of
  the fifteenth century to be madness.

  Columbus, in the National Library, Madrid]

HIS NOTION OF THE DISTANCE TO ASIA. Columbus made two fortunate
  errors in reckoning the distance to the Indies. He imagined that Asia
  extended much farther eastward than it actually does, making it nearer
  Europe, and estimated the earth to be smaller than it is. His figures
  placed Japan less than 3,000 miles west of the Canary Islands, instead
  of the 12,000 miles which is the real distance. He accordingly thought
  Japan would be found about where Mexico or Florida is situated.

HOW HE SECURED HELP. Even so, many years passed before Columbus was
  able to undertake a voyage. He was too poor himself, and needed the help
  of some government to fit out such an expedition. He may have tried to
  get his native city, Genoa, to help him. There is such a story. If he
  did, it was without success. He tried to obtain the help of Portugal,
  where he lived a long time, and whose princes were greatly interested in
  the discovery of new trade routes. His brother visited England in the
  same cause. Neither of these countries, however, was willing to
  undertake this expensive and doubtful enterprise.

  The King and Queen of Spain, to whom Columbus turned, kept him waiting
  many years for an answer. They thought that they had more important work
  in hand. There was another king in Spain at the time, the king of the
  Moors. Ferdinand and Isabella, the Christian king and queen, were trying
  to conquer the Moors, and thus to end the struggle between Christians
  and Mohammedans for the possession of Spain, which had lasted nearly
  eight centuries. This war required all the strength and revenue
  of Spain.

  Fortunately, just as Columbus was becoming thoroughly discouraged, the
  war with the Moors came to an end. Granada, the seat of their former
  power, was finally taken in January, 1492. Now was a good time to ask
  favors of the sovereigns of Spain, and to plan large enterprises for the
  future. Powerful friends aided Columbus to renew his petition, and Queen
  Isabella was persuaded to promise him all the help that he needed.

THE SHIPS OF COLUMBUS. Three ships, or caravels as they were
  called, were fitted out. The _Santa Maria_ was the largest of the three,
  but it was not much larger than the small sailing yachts which we see
  to-day. It was about ninety feet long by twenty feet broad, and had a
  single deck. This was Columbus's principal ship or flagship. The second
  caravel, the _Pinta_, was much swifter, built high at the prow and
  stern, and furnished with a forecastle for the crew and a cabin for the
  officers, but without a deck in the center. The third and smallest
  caravel, called the _Nina_, the Spanish word for baby, was built much
  like the _Pinta_. Ninety persons made up the three crews.

  [Illustration: COLUMBUS'S IDEAS OF THE ATLANTIC The shaded portions
  represent the land as Columbus expected to find it. The light outline
  of the Americas shows the actual position of the land as he found it.]

  The ships were the usual size of those which coasted along the shores
  of Europe in the fifteenth century. Expeditions had never gone far out
  into the ocean. Columbus preferred the smaller vessels in a voyage of
  discovery, because they would be able to run close to the shores and
  into the smaller harbors and up the rivers.

BEGINNING OF THE VOYAGE. The expedition set sail from Palos in
  Spain, August 3, 1492. It went directly to the Canary Islands. These
  were owned by Spain, and were selected by Columbus as the most
  convenient starting-point. The little fleet was delayed three weeks at
  the islands making repairs. On September 6 Columbus was off again. He
  struck due west from the Canaries.

THE TERRORS OF THE VOYAGE. While the little fleet was still in
  sight of the Canary Islands a volcanic eruption nearly frightened the
  sailors out of their wits. They deemed such an event an omen of evil.
  But the expedition had fine weather day after day. Steady, gentle,
  easterly winds, the trade winds of the tropics, wafted them slowly
  westward. But the timid sailors began to wonder how they would ever be
  able to return against winds which seemed never to change from the east.

  Then they came to an immense field of seaweed, larger in area than the
  whole of Spain. This terrified the sailors, who feared they might be
  driven on hidden rocks or be engulfed in quicksands. They imagined, too,
  that great sea-monsters were lurking beyond the seaweed waiting to
  devour them.

  [Illustration: A CARAVEL OF COLUMBUS After the reconstructed
  model exhibited at the Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893]

THE FIRST SIGNS OF A NEW LAND. In spite of fears and complaints,
  and threats of resistance, Columbus kept a westward course for more than
  four weeks. Then as he began to see so many birds flying to the
  southwest, he concluded that land must be nearer in that direction. He
  had heard that most of the islands held by the Portuguese were
  discovered by following the flight of birds. So on October 7 the
  westward course was changed to one slightly southwest.

  From this time on the signs of land grew frequent. Floating branches,
  occasionally covered with berries, pieces of wood, bits of cane, were
  encouraging signs. Birds like ducks and sandpipers became common sights.
  The Queen had promised a small pension to the one who should first see
  land. Columbus had offered to give a silken doublet in addition. With
  what eagerness the sailors must have kept on the lookout!

THE GREAT DISCOVERY. At last as the fleet was sailing onward in the
  bright moonlight Columbus saw a light moving as if carried by hand along
  a shore. A few hours later, about two o'clock on the morning of October
  12, a sailor on the _Pinta_ saw land distinctly, and soon all beheld, a
  few miles away, a long, low beach. The vessels hove to and waited for
  daylight. Early the same day, Friday, October 12, 1492, they approached
  the land, which proved to be a small island. Columbus named it San
  Salvador, which means Holy Saviour. We do not know which one of the
  Bahama islands he first saw, but we believe it was the one now called
  Watling Island. Columbus went ashore with the royal standard and banners
  flying to take possession of the land in the name of King Ferdinand and
  Queen Isabella.

WHERE COLUMBUS THOUGHT HE WAS. The astonished inhabitants of the
  island soon gathered to see the strange sight--the landing of white men
  in the West Indies. They looked upon the ships as sea-monsters, and the
  white men as gods. Nor was Columbus less puzzled by what he saw. The
  people were a strange race--cinnamon colored, naked, greased, and
  painted to suit each one's fancy. They had only the rudest means of
  self-defense, and were almost as poor as the parrots that chattered in
  the trees above them. Such savages bore little resemblance to the people
  whom Marco Polo said inhabited the Spice Islands.

  Columbus thought that he had reached some outlying island not far from
  Japan. A cruise of a few days among the Bahamas satisfied him that he
  was in the ocean near the coast of Asia, for had not Marco Polo
  described it as studded with thousands of spice-bearing islands? He had
  not found any spices, but the air was full of fragrance and the trees
  and herbs were strange in appearance. Of course if the islands were the
  Indies, the people must be Indians. Columbus called them Indians, and
  this name clung to the red men, although their islands were not the
  true Indies.

  [Illustration: WATLING ISLAND, WHERE COLUMBUS FIRST LANDED]

THE SEARCH FOR THE GOLDEN EAST. Columbus thought that the natives
  meant to tell him in their sign language of a great land to the south
  where gold abounded. He set off in search of this, and came upon a land
  the natives called Cuba. Its large size convinced him that he had at
  last found the Asiatic mainland, and he sent two messengers, one a Jew
  knowing many languages, in search of the Emperor of China. They found
  neither cities nor kingdoms, neither gold nor spices. This was a great
  disappointment to Columbus, but he patiently kept up his search for the
  riches which he expected to find.

THE MISFORTUNES OF COLUMBUS. While on the coast of Cuba, Pinzon,
  the commander of the _Pinta_, deserted him. Pinzon, whose ship was
  swifter than the others, probably wished to be the first to get home, in
  order to tell a story which would gain him the credit of the discovery
  of the Indies. A few days later Columbus discovered a large island which
  the natives called Hayti, and which he called Espanola or "Spanish
  Land." At every island he searched for the spices and gold which Marco
  Polo had given him reason to expect. In a storm off Espanola Columbus's
  own ship, the _Santa Maria_, was totally wrecked. Such disasters
  convinced him that it was high time to return to Spain with the news of
  his discovery.

PREPARATIONS FOR RETURN TO SPAIN. As there was not room for both
  crews on the tiny _Nina_, his one remaining ship, it became necessary to
  leave about forty sailors in Espanola. A fort was built, and supplies
  were left for a year. Columbus with the rest set off on the return to
  Spain. Ten Indians were captured and taken with them to show to his
  friends in Europe. Besides, Columbus hoped that they would learn the
  language of Spain, and carry Christianity back to their people.

THE SEARCH FOR CHINA RENEWED. There was rejoicing in Palos when the
  voyagers returned. Great honors were bestowed upon Columbus. It was now
  easy to get men and money for another voyage. In September, 1493,
  Columbus started to return to his islands, this time with seventeen
  ships and fifteen hundred men, all confident that they would soon see
  the marble palaces of China, and secure a share in the wealth of the
  Spice Islands. No one yet realized that a new world--two great
  continents--lay between them and their coveted goal in Asia. Columbus
  went directly to Espanola, where he found that his colony of the
  previous year had been murdered by the Indians. A new settlement was
  quickly started. A little town called Isabella was built, with a fort, a
  church, a market place, public granary, and dwelling-houses. Isabella
  was the first real settlement in the New World.

  [Illustration: MAP OF LANDS DISCOVERED BY COLUMBUS]

OTHER VOYAGES TO THE NEW WORLD. Columbus made two other voyages. He
  continued to search for the coast of Asia, which he believed to be near.
  He made a third voyage from Spain to the West Indies in 1498. He sailed
  farther south, and came upon the mainland which later was called South
  America. A fourth expedition in 1502 touched on the coast that we call
  Central America. He died soon after this voyage, still believing that he
  had discovered a new route to the Indies and new lands on the coast
  of Asia.

THE SAD END OF COLUMBUS'S LIFE. The close of his life was a sad
  one. The lands he had found did not yield the riches which he had
  expected. The colonists whom he had sent out to the islands had
  rebelled, and jealous enemies had accused him falsely before the king
  and queen of misgovernment in his territories. Once his opponents had
  him carried to Spain chained like a common prisoner. He was given his
  liberty on reaching Spain, but the people had become prejudiced
  against him.

  Ferdinand, the son of Columbus, tells us that as he and his brother
  Diego, who were pages in the queen's service, happened to pass a crowd
  of his father's enemies, the latter greeted them with hoots: "There go
  the sons of the Admiral of Mosquitoland, the man who has discovered a
  land of vanity and deceit, the grave of Spanish gentlemen." Hardships
  and disappointments broke down the great discoverer, and he died
  neglected and almost forgotten by the people of Spain.

    QUESTIONS

    1. What plan did Columbus form? Why was it bolder than the plan Diaz
    had carried out in 1487, or even than that Da Gama carried out a few
    years later? Why did men like Columbus and Diaz desire to find a sea
    route to India? Had anybody before Columbus believed the
    earth round?

    2. What mistake did Columbus make in estimating the size of the
    earth? Why was this a fortunate error?

    3. From what countries did Columbus try to obtain help? Why did he
    find it so hard to secure this? What event in Spain finally favored
    his cause? Who were the Moors?

    4. Why was Columbus surprised when he saw the natives in the West
    Indies? Why were the Indians on their side surprised?

    5. What islands did Columbus find and claim for Spain on his first
    voyage? How many other voyages did he make? What new lands did he
    find on his later voyages? What did he think he had found?

    6. Why did the enemies of Columbus in Spain call him the Admiral of
    Mosquitoland, the man who discovered a land of vanity and deceit,
    the grave of Spanish gentlemen? What did they mean by this?



    EXERCISES

    1. Find pictures of the ships of Columbus or of the sailing ships of
    other explorers of that day. How does the deck arrangement on those
    differ from the ocean steamships of to-day? What advantage would
    ships like those of Columbus have over present steamships in
    exploring strange coasts? What disadvantages?

    2. Draw up a list of reasons why Columbus's sailors were afraid to
    go on and wished to turn back to Spain.

    3. Trace on an outline map the voyage of Columbus. Mark where
    Columbus found land, and where he expected to find Japan and China.
    What great mass of land was really very near the island he first
    discovered?

    4. Find from the maps mentioned in Chapter IV (Greek World), Chapter
    VII (Roman World), Chapter VIII (The world after Polo's journey),
    and Chapter XIV (The world as known after Columbus), how much more
    the Romans knew of the world than the Greeks had known, the
    Europeans after Marco Polo's journey than the Romans, and the
    Europeans after Columbus's voyage than after Marco Polo's journey.

OTHERS HELP IN THE DISCOVERY OF THE NEW WORLD

THE RACE TO THE INDIES. The discovery of all the lands which make
  what we call the New World came very slowly. It was the work of many
  different explorers. Most of the expeditions sent out to the new islands
  went in search of a passage to India. It was a fine race. Each nation
  was eager to see its ships the first to reach India by the westward
  route. All were disappointed at finding so much land between Europe and
  Asia. It seemed to them to be of little value and to block the way to
  the richer countries of the East. Gradually, however, they discovered
  the great continents which we know as North and South America. Columbus
  had done more than he dreamed, and his discovery was a turning-point
  in history.

JOHN CABOT. John Cabot, an Italian mariner at this time in the
  service of England, left Bristol in 1497 on a voyage of discovery. This
  was five years after Columbus discovered the West Indies. Cabot had
  heard that the sailors of Portugal and of Spain had occupied unknown
  islands. He planned to do the same for King Henry VII of England. For
  his voyage he had a single vessel no larger than the _Nina_, the
  smallest ship in the fleet of Columbus. Eighteen men made up his crew.
  He passed around the southern end of Ireland, and sailed north and west
  until he came to land, which proved to be the coast of North America
  somewhere between the northern part of Labrador and the southern end of
  Nova Scotia.

CABOT'S DISCOVERY. John Cabot saw no inhabitants, but he found
