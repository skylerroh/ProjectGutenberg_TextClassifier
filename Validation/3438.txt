SECT. IV.--_Observations upon the Combinations of Oxygen with the simple
Substances._

Oxygen forms almost a third of the mass of our atmosphere, and is
consequently one of the most plentiful substances in nature. All the
animals and vegetables live and grow in this immense magazine of oxygen
gas, and from it we procure the greatest part of what we employ in
experiments. So great is the reciprocal affinity between this element
and other substances, that we cannot procure it disengaged from all
combination. In the atmosphere it is united with caloric, in the state
of oxygen gas, and this again is mixed with about two thirds of its
weight of azotic gas.

Several conditions are requisite to enable a body to become oxygenated,
or to permit oxygen to enter into combination with it. In the first
place, it is necessary that the particles of the body to be oxygenated
shall have less reciprocal attraction with each other than they have for
the oxygen, which otherwise cannot possibly combine with them. Nature,
in this case, may be assisted by art, as we have it in our power to
diminish the attraction of the particles of bodies almost at will by
heating them, or, in other words, by introducing caloric into the
interstices between their particles; and, as the attraction of these
particles for each other is diminished in the inverse ratio of their
distance, it is evident that there must be a certain point of distance
of particles when the affinity they possess with each other becomes less
than that they have for oxygen, and at which oxygenation must
necessarily take place if oxygen be present.

We can readily conceive that the degree of heat at which this phenomenon
begins must be different in different bodies. Hence, on purpose to
oxygenate most bodies, especially the greater part of the simple
substances, it is only necessary to expose them to the influence of the
air of the atmosphere in a convenient degree of temperature. With
respect to lead, mercury, and tin, this needs be but little higher than
the medium temperature of the earth; but it requires a more considerable
degree of heat to oxygenate iron, copper, &c. by the dry way, or when
this operation is not assisted by moisture. Sometimes oxygenation takes
place with great rapidity, and is accompanied by great sensible heat,
light, and flame; such is the combustion of phosphorus in atmospheric
air, and of iron in oxygen gas. That of sulphur is less rapid; and the
oxygenation of lead, tin, and most of the metals, takes place vastly
slower, and consequently the disengagement of caloric, and more
especially of light, is hardly sensible.

Some substances have so strong an affinity with oxygen, and combine with
it in such low degrees of temperature, that we cannot procure them in
their unoxygenated state; such is the muriatic acid, which has not
hitherto been decomposed by art, perhaps even not by nature, and which
consequently has only been found in the state of acid. It is probable
that many other substances of the mineral kingdom are necessarily
oxygenated in the common temperature of the atmosphere, and that being
already saturated with oxygen, prevents their farther action upon that
element.

There are other means of oxygenating simple substances besides exposure
to air in a certain degree of temperature, such as by placing them in
contact with metals combined with oxygen, and which have little affinity
with that element. The red oxyd of mercury is one of the best substances
for this purpose, especially with bodies which do not combine with that
metal. In this oxyd the oxygen is united with very little force to the
metal, and can be driven out by a degree of heat only sufficient to make
glass red hot; wherefore such bodies as are capable of uniting with
oxygen are readily oxygenated, by means of being mixed with red oxyd of
mercury, and moderately heated. The same effect may be, to a certain
degree, produced by means of the black oxyd of manganese, the red oxyd
of lead, the oxyds of silver, and by most of the metallic oxyds, if we
only take care to choose such as have less affinity with oxygen than the
bodies they are meant to oxygenate. All the metallic reductions and
revivifications belong to this class of operations, being nothing more
than oxygenations of charcoal, by means of the several metallic oxyds.
The charcoal combines with the oxygen and with caloric, and escapes in
form of carbonic acid gas, while the metal remains pure and revivified,
or deprived of the oxygen which before combined with it in the form of
oxyd.

All combustible substances may likewise be oxygenated by means of mixing
them with nitrat of potash or of soda, or with oxygenated muriat of
potash, and subjecting the mixture to a certain degree of heat; the
oxygen, in this case, quits the nitrat or the muriat, and combines with
the combustible body. This species of oxygenation requires to be
performed with extreme caution, and only with very small quantities;
because, as the oxygen enters into the composition of nitrats, and more
especially of oxygenated muriats, combined with almost as much caloric
as is necessary for converting it into oxygen gas, this immense quantity
of caloric becomes suddenly free the instant of the combination of the
oxygen with the combustible body, and produces such violent explosions
as are perfectly irresistible.

By the humid way we can oxygenate most combustible bodies, and convert
most of the oxyds of the three kingdoms of nature into acids. For this
purpose we chiefly employ the nitric acid, which has a very slight hold
of oxygen, and quits it readily to a great number of bodies by the
assistance of a gentle heat. The oxygenated muriatic acid may be used
for several operations of this kind, but not in them all.

I give the name of _binary_ to the combinations of oxygen with the
simple substances, because in these only two elements are combined. When
three substances are united in one combination I call it _ternary_, and
_quaternary_ when the combination consists of four substances united.

SECT. V.--_Observations upon the Combinations of Oxygen with the
Compound Radicals._

I published a new theory of the nature and formation of acids in the
Memoirs of the Academy for 1776, p. 671. and 1778, p. 535. in which I
concluded, that the number of acids must be greatly larger than was till
then supposed. Since that time, a new field of inquiry has been opened
to chemists; and, instead of five or six acids which were then known,
near thirty new acids have been discovered, by which means the number of
known neutral salts have been increased in the same proportion. The
nature of the acidifiable bases, or radicals of the acids, and the
degrees of oxygenation they are susceptible of, still remain to be
inquired into. I have already shown, that almost all the oxydable and
acidifiable radicals from the mineral kingdom are simple, and that, on
the contrary, there hardly exists any radical in the vegetable, and more
especially in the animal kingdom, but is composed of at least two
substances, hydrogen and charcoal, and that azote and phosphorus are
frequently united to these, by which we have compound radicals of two,
three, and four bases or simple elements united.

From these observations, it appears that the vegetable and animal oxyds
and acids may differ from each other in three several ways: 1st,
According to the number of simple acidifiable elements of which their
radicals are composed: 2dly, According to the proportions in which these
are combined together: And, 3dly, According to their different degrees
of oxygenation: Which circumstances are more than sufficient to explain
the great variety which nature produces in these substances. It is not
at all surprising, after this, that most of the vegetable acids are
convertible into each other, nothing more being requisite than to change
the proportions of the hydrogen and charcoal in their composition, and
to oxygenate them in a greater or lesser degree. This has been done by
Mr Crell in some very ingenious experiments, which have been verified
and extended by Mr Hassenfratz. From these it appears, that charcoal and
hydrogen, by a first oxygenation, produce tartarous acid, oxalic acid by
a second degree, and acetous or acetic acid by a third, or higher
oxygenation; only, that charcoal seems to exist in a rather smaller
proportion in the acetous and acetic acids. The citric and malic acids
differ little from the preceding acids.

Ought we then to conclude that the oils are the radicals of the
vegetable and animal acids? I have already expressed my doubts upon
this subject: 1st, Although the oils appear to be formed of nothing but
hydrogen and charcoal, we do not know if these are in the precise
proportion necessary for constituting the radicals of the acids: 2dly,
Since oxygen enters into the composition of these acids equally with
hydrogen and charcoal, there is no more reason for supposing them to be
composed of oil rather than of water or of carbonic acid. It is true
that they contain the materials necessary for all these combinations,
but then these do not take place in the common temperature of the
atmosphere; all the three elements remain combined in a state of
equilibrium, which is readily destroyed by a temperature only a little
above that of boiling water[39].

SECT. VI.--_Observations upon the Combinations of Azote with the Simple
Substances._

Azote is one of the most abundant elements; combined with caloric it
forms azotic gas, or mephitis, which composes nearly two thirds of the
atmosphere. This element is always in the state of gas in the ordinary
pressure and temperature, and no degree of compression or of cold has
been hitherto capable of reducing it either to a solid or liquid form.
This is likewise one of the essential constituent elements of animal
bodies, in which it is combined with charcoal and hydrogen, and
sometimes with phosphorus; these are united together by a certain
portion of oxygen, by which they are formed into oxyds or acids
according to the degree of oxygenation. Hence the animal substances may
be varied, in the same way with vegetables, in three different manners:
1st, According to the number of elements which enter into the
composition of the base or radical: 2dly, According to the proportions
of these elements: 3dly, According to the degree of oxygenation.

When combined with oxygen, azote forms the nitrous and nitric oxyds and
acids; when with hydrogen, ammoniac is produced. Its combinations with
the other simple elements are very little known; to these we give the
name of Azurets, preserving the termination in _uret_ for all
nonoxygenated compounds. It is extremely probable that all the alkaline
substances may hereafter be found to belong to this genus of azurets.

The azotic gas may be procured from atmospheric air, by absorbing the
oxygen gas which is mixed with it by means of a solution of sulphuret of
potash, or sulphuret of lime. It requires twelve or fifteen days to
complete this process, during which time the surface in contact must be
frequently renewed by agitation, and by breaking the pellicle which
forms on the top of the solution. It may likewise be procured by
dissolving animal substances in dilute nitric acid very little heated.
In this operation, the azote is disengaged in form of gas, which we
receive under bell glasses filled with water in the pneumato-chemical
apparatus. We may procure this gas by deflagrating nitre with charcoal,
or any other combustible substance; when with charcoal, the azotic gas
is mixed with carbonic acid gas, which may be absorbed by a solution of
caustic alkali, or by lime water, after which the azotic gas remains
pure. We can procure it in a fourth manner from combinations of ammoniac
with metallic oxyds, as pointed out by Mr de Fourcroy: The hydrogen of
the ammoniac combines with the oxygen of the oxyd, and forms water,
whilst the azote being left free escapes in form of gas.

The combinations of azote were but lately discovered: Mr Cavendish first
observed it in nitrous gas and acid, and Mr Berthollet in ammoniac and
