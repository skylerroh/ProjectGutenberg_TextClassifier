heated, a plate is seized by a walking crane and immersed in the oil.

Hoops for cannon are manufactured here in large quantities. They are
cut from solid ingots, and those for guns up to 24 centimeters are
rolled like railway tires; those for larger calibers are forged on a
mandrel. Jackets of large size are also manufactured; these are made
from solid ingots, which, after being forged, are bored out.

At Le Creusot a remarkable test of hoops was witnessed, which
exemplifies not only the excellence of the manufacture of the steel
but also the exacting character of the French requirements. The hoops
for naval guns are made with the interior surface slightly conical.
When forged, turned, and brought under a hammer, a standard mandrel of
steel, conically shaped to suit the form of the cone in the hoop, but
of a slightly increased diameter, is introduced, the smaller end
of the mandrel being able to enter the larger end of the hoop. The
mandrel is then forced in by the hammer until its lower edge has
passed through the hoop. The blows are then made to operate on the
upper edge, detaching it from the mandrel. Careful measurements are
taken of the diameter of the hoop before and after this test, and it
is required that the measurement subsequent to the operation shall
show that the hoop has partially, but not entirely, returned to the
diameter that it had before the entrance of the mandrel. This would
show that there is left to the metal a small margin within its elastic
limit. A system of manufacture which can comply with such a refinement
of exactitude must be very precise.

Perhaps the most striking feature at Le Creusot is the forge, where is
assembled an array of steam hammers not equaled in the world, viz.:

  One 100 ton hammer with a fall of 5 meters.
  One 40 ton hammer with a fall of 3 meters.
  One 15 ton hammer with a fall of 3 meters.
  Two 10 ton hammers with a fall of 2 1/2 meters.
  One 8 ton hammer with a fall of 2 1/2 meters.

As the 100 ton hammer at these works is the largest in the world, some
particulars concerning it will be appropriate.

The foundations are composed of a mass of masonry laid in cement
resting on bed rock, which occurs at a depth of 11 meters, an anvil
block of cast iron, and a filling-in of oak timber designed to
diminish by its elasticity the vibrations resulting from the blows of
the hammer. The masonry foundation presents a cube of 600 meters.
Its upper surface is covered with a layer of oak about one meter in
thickness, placed horizontally, on which rests the anvil block.

At the Perm foundry in Russia the anvil block for the 50 ton hammer
is made in one piece, moulded and cast on the spot it was intended to
occupy. Its weight is 622 tons. At Le Creusot, however, this idea
was not approved, and it was determined to construct the block in six
horizontal courses, each bedded upon plane surfaces. Each course is
formed of two castings, except the upper one, a single block, which
weighs 120 tons and supports the anvil. Thus formed in 11 pieces, it
is 5.6 meters high, 33 square meters at the base, and 7 square meters
at the top. Its entire weight is 720 tons.

The space between the block and the sides of the masonry in which it
rests is filled in solidly with oak. The block is thus independent of
the frame of the superstructure.

The legs of the frame, inclining toward each other in the form of an
A, are secured at their bases to a foundation plate embedded in the
masonry. They are hollow, of cast iron, and of rectangular cross
section, each leg in two pieces joined midway of their length by
flanges and bolts. The legs are also bound together by four plates of
wrought iron, which, at the same time, holds the guides. The height of
the legs is 10.25 meters, and their weight, with the guides, 250 tons.
The binding plates weigh together about 25 tons, and the foundation
plates 90 tons.

The entablature of the frame work weighs 30 tons; on it is placed the
steam cylinder, single acting, made in two pieces, each 3 meters
long united by flanges and bolts. The diameter of the cylinder is 1.9
meters, giving a surface of 27,345 square centimeters (deducting the
section of the rod, which is 36 centimeters in diameter); which, for
5 atmospheres, gives a pressure under the piston of about 140 tons.
As the weight of the hammer is 100 tons, it is evident that it can be
raised with great velocity.

The stroke of the piston in the cylinder is 5 meters. This height
of fall, multiplied by the 100,000 kilogrammes of the mass, gives a
working force of 500,000 kilogrammeters, or about 1,640 foot tons. The
width between the legs is 7.5 meters, and the free height under the
cross ties 3 meters, thus providing ample space for maneuvering large
masses of metal.

The entire height of this colossal structure from the base of the
masonry foundation to the upper part of the steam cylinder is 31
meters (102 feet), but notwithstanding this unfavorable condition for
stability and the enormous effect resulting from a shock of 500,000
kilogrammeters, everything is so well proportioned that there is but
slight vibration.

The workman who maneuvers the hammer is placed on a platform on one
of the legs, about 3 meters above the floor. He is here protected
from the heat reflected from the mass of metal during the operation of
forging.

PLAN FOR AN ELEVATED RAILWAY AT PARIS.


Elevated railways have been in operation for a long time in New York,
Berlin, and Vienna, and the city of Paris has decided to have recourse
to this mode of carriage, so indispensable to large cities. The
question of establishing a line of railways in our capital has been
open, as well known, since 1871. During this period of nearly fourteen
years this grave subject has at various times given rise to serious
discussions, in which the most competent engineers have taken part,
and numerous projects relating to the solution that it calls for have
been put forth.

The problem to be solved is of the most complex nature, and the
engineers who have studied it have not been able to come to an
agreement except as regards a small number of points. It may even be
said that unanimity exists upon but a single point, and that is that
the means of locomotion in Paris do not answer the requirements of
the public, and that there is an urgent necessity for new ones. The
capital question, that of knowing whether the railway to be built
shall be beneath or above ground, is not yet settled; for, up to the
present, no project has been prescribed in one direction or the other.

While some extol the underground solution as being the only one
that, without interfering with circulation in the streets, permits
of establishing a double-track railway capable of giving passage
to ordinary rolling stock and of connecting directly with the large
lines, others, objecting that such a road could not give satisfaction
to the taste of Parisians, and that it would necessitate work out of
proportion to the advantages gained, conclude upon the adoption of an
open air railway.

Preferences generally are evidently for this latter solution.

We have received from a learned engineer, Mr. Jules Garnier, a
project for an elevated railway, which appears to us to be very ably
conceived, very well studied out, and which we hasten to make known.

(1.) The system is characterized by the following fundamental points:
The up and down tracks, instead of being laid alongside of each other,
as in an ordinary railway, are superposed upon two distinct platforms
forming a viaduct, which is consequently so arranged as to permit of
the laying of one of the tracks at its lower part and of the other at
its upper.

(2.) The system of constructing the viaduct is so combined as to be
capable of giving passage upon the road to the rolling stock of the
large lines during the stoppage of the daily passenger trains.

(3.) The tracks are connected at the extremities by a curve that has
the proper incline to compensate for the difference in level between
the two, and which has a sufficiently large radius to allow the slope
of the track to be kept within the limits admitted. The running of the
trains is thus uninterrupted.

(4.) When two lines of different directions bisect one another, a
special arrangement permits the passengers from one line to pass to
the other by means of what is called a "tangent" station, without
the trains of one line crossing the tracks of another, the purpose of
which arrangement is to avoid those accidents that would inevitably
occur through the crossing of a track by the trains of a transverse
line.

(5.) The rolling stock is arranged in a manner that allows the
entrance and exit of the passengers to be effected with great
promptness.

In ordinary avenues, comprising a roadway and two sidewalks, the
elevated railway is placed in the axis of the roadway at a sufficient
height to prevent it interfering with the passage of carriages, say
14 3/4 feet above the surface, while in boulevards or avenues of great
width, having _contre-allees_[1] bordered by a double row of trees, it
is installed in one of the _contre-allees_.

   [Footnote 1: Paths parallel with the public walks.]

In the first case (Fig. 1), the viaduct is wholly metallic, while
in the second it comprises masonry arches surmounted by a metallic
superstructure. The viaduct is formed of independent spans supported
by metallic piers that rest upon masonry foundations (Fig. 2).

[Illustration: FIG. 1.--PROJECT FOR A PARISIAN ELEVATED RAILWAY.]

[Illustration: FIG. 2.--LONGITUDINAL ELEVATION.]

The line will have three kinds of stations, intermediate, "tangent,"
and terminal ones. It is at the latter that the two superposed lines
are connected by the circular inclined plane.

The waiting platforms of the intermediate stations will be formed
simply by the widening of the span corresponding to the station.
Access to these platforms will be had by stairs running up from the
edge of the sidewalk. The passengers will make their exit by means of
corresponding stairs on the opposite side. (Figs 3 and 4.)

[Illustration: FIG. 3.--A STATION.]

[Illustration: FIG. 4.--TRANSVERSE SECTION OF STATION.]

The tangent stations are placed at the meeting point of two lines,
which, instead of crossing each other, are bent inward like an X, the
two parts of which will be tangent to the central point. Through
such arrangements the running of the trains will be continuous, and
a traveler reaching one of these stations will be able, upon changing
train, to take at his option any one of the three other directions.

As may be seen, Mr. Garnier's project presents conditions which
are very favorable to the establishment of an elevated road in the
interior of Paris. Far from injuring the aspect of the great arteries
of our metropolis, the viaduct, as it has been conceived, will
contribute toward giving them a still more imposing look. If the
beautiful is, as has been said, the expression of the useful, an
elevated railway, well conceived, may be beautiful. The project of
a subterranean railway is attended with great drawbacks, not only
as regards the great expense that it would necessitate, but also the
difficulties of constructing it. And there is a still graver objection
to it, and that is that it would oblige travelers to move like moles
in dark, cold, and moist tunnels. At Paris, where we are accustomed
to a pleasant climate and clear atmosphere, we like plenty of air and
broad daylight.--_La Nature._

ENGINEERING INVENTIONS SINCE 1862.[1]

   [Footnote 1: Address of Sir Frederick Joseph Bramwell, F.R.S., on
   his election as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers.
   January 13, 1885.]

By Sir F. J. BRAMWELL.


I propose to devote the very limited time at my disposal to the
consideration of some of the most important of those improvements
which are obviously and immediately connected with civil engineering.
I am aware of the danger there is of making a serious mistake, when
one excludes any matter which at the moment appears to be of but a
trivial character. For who knows how speedily some development may
show that the judgment which had guided the selection was entirely
erroneous, and that that which had been passed over was in truth the
germ of a great improvement? Nevertheless, in the interests of time
some risk must be run, and a selection must be made; I propose,
therefore, to ask your attention while I consider certain of
(following the full title of Division I.) "The apparatus, appliances,
processes, and products invented or brought into use since 1862."
In those matters which may be said to involve the principles of
engineering construction, there must of necessity be but little
progress to note.

Principles are generally very soon determined, and progress ensues,
not by additions to the principles, but by improvement in the methods
of giving to those principles a practical shape, or by combining in
one structure principles of construction which had been hitherto
used apart. Therefore, to avoid the necessity of having a pause, in
referring to a work, by finding that one is overstepping the boundary
of principle, and trenching within the domain of construction, I think
it will be well to treat these two heads together.

If my record had gone back to just before 1851 (the date of the great
exhibition), I might have described much progress in the principles
of girder construction; for shortly prior to that date, the plain
cast-iron beam, with the greater part of the metal in the web, and
with but little in the top and bottom flange, was in common use; and
even in the preparation of the building for that exhibition, it is
recorded that one of the engineers connected therewith had great
difficulty in understanding how it was that the form of open work
girder, with double diagonals introduced therein (a form which was for
years afterward known as the exhibition girder), was any stronger
than a girder with open panels separated by uprights, and without any
diagonals. But, long before 1862, the Warren and other truss-girders
had come into use, and I am inclined to say that, so far as novelty
in the principle of girder-construction is concerned, I must confine
myself to that combination of principles which is represented by the
suspended cantilever, of which the Forth Bridge, only now in course
of construction, affords the most notable instance. It is difficult to
see how a rigid bridge, with 1,700 foot spans, and with the necessity
for so much clear headway below, could have been constructed without
the application of this principle.


BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION.

Pursuing this subject of bridge work, the St. Louis Bridge of Mr. Eads
may, I think, be fairly said to embody a principle of construction
novel since 1862, that of employing for the arch-ribs tubes composed
of steel staves hooped together. Further, in suspension bridges there
has been introduced that which I think is fairly entitled to rank
among principles of construction, the light upper chain, from
which are suspended the linked truss-rods, doing the actual work of
supporting the load, the rods being maintained in straight lines, and
without the flexure at the joints due to their weight. In the East
River Bridge, New York, there was also introduced that which I believe
was a novelty in the mode of applying the wire cables. These were not
made as untwisted cables and then hoisted into place, thereby imposing
severe strains upon many of the wires composing the cable through
their flexure over the saddles and elsewhere, but the individual
wires were led over from side to side, each one having the length
appropriate to its position, and all, therefore, when the bridge was
erected, having the same initial strain and the same fair play. Within
the period we are considering, the employment of testing-machines has
come into the daily practice of the engineer; by the use of these he
is made experimentally acquainted with the various physical properties
of the materials he employs, and is also enabled in the largest of
these machines to test the strength and usefulness of these materials,
when assembled into forms, to resist strains, as columns or
as girders. I of course do not for one moment mean to say that
experimental machines were unknown or unused prior to 1862--chain
cable testing-machines are of old date, and were employed by our past
President, Mr. Barlow, and by others, in their early experiments upon
steel; but I speak of it as a matter of congratulation that, in lieu
of such machines being used by the few, and at rare intervals upon
small specimens, for experimental purposes, they are now employed in
daily practice and on a large scale.

In harbor work we have had the principle of construction employed by
Mr. Stoney at Dublin, where cement masonry is moulded into the form
of the wall for its whole height and thickness, and for such a length
forward as can be admitted, having regard to the practical limit of
the weight of the block, and then, the block being carried to its
place, is lowered on to the bottom, which has been prepared to receive
it, and is secured to the work already executed by groove and tongue.

It would not be right, even in this brief notice of such a mode
of construction, to omit mention of the very carefully thought out
apparatus by which the blocks are raised off the seats whereon they
have been made, and are transported to their destination. It is no
simple undertaking (even in these days) to raise (otherwise than
hydraulically) a weight of 350 tons, which is the weight of the
blocks with which Mr. Stoney deals. But he does this by means of
pulley-blocks attached to shears built on the vessel which is to
transport the block, and he contrives to lift the weight without
putting upon his chains the extra strain due to the friction of the
numerous pulleys over which they pass. The height of the lift is only
the few inches needed to raise the block clear of the quay on which it
has been formed, and this is obtained by winding up the chain by steam
gear quite taut, so as to take a considerable strain, but not that
equal to the weight of the block, and then water is pumped into the
opposite end of the vessel to that upon which the shears are carried,
this latter end rises, and the block is raised off the seat on which
it was formed, without the chains being put to work to do the actual
lifting at all. The vessel, with the block suspended to the shear legs
and over the bows, is then ready to be removed to the place where
the block has to be laid. A word must here be said about an extremely
ingenious mode of dealing with the slack chain, to prevent its
becoming fouled, and not paying out properly, when the block is being
lowered. This is accomplished by reeving the slack of each chain over
two fixed sets of multiple sheaves.

A donkey-engine works a little crab having a large drum, the chain
from which is connected with the main chain, and draws it round the
multiple sheaves so as to take up the slack as fast as the main crab
gives it out. The steam is always on the donkey, which is of such
limited dimensions that it can do no injury to the chain even when its
full power is in vain endeavoring to draw it any further; directly,
however, the main crab gives more slack, and the chain between it and
the two sets of sheaves falls into a deeper catenary, and one which
therefore puts less opposition to the motion of the donkey-engine,
that engine goes to work and makes a further haul upon the slack, and
in this way, and automatically, the slack is kept clear.


PNEUMATIC FOUNDATIONS.

A noteworthy instance of the use of pneumatic appliances in cylinder
sinking for foundations is that in progress at the Forth Bridge. The
wrought-iron cylinders are 70 feet in diameter at the cutting-edge,
and have a taper of about 1 in 46. They are, however, at a height of 1
foot above low water (that is, at the commencement of the masonry work
of the pier) reduced to 60 feet in diameter; at their bottoms there is
a roofed chamber, into which the air is pumped, and in which the men
work when excavating, this roof being supported by ample main and
cross lattice girders. Shafts with air-locks and pipes for admitting
water and ejecting silt are provided. The air-locks are fitted with
sliding doors, worked by hydraulic rams, or by hand, the doors being
interlocked in a manner similar to that in which railway points and
signals are interlocked, so that one door cannot be opened until the
other is closed. The hoisting of the excavated material is done by a
steam engine fixed outside the lock, this engine working a shaft on
which there is a drum inside the lock, the shaft passing air-tight
through a stuffing box. A separate air-lock, with doors, ladder, etc.,
complete, is provided to give ingress and egress for the workmen.
I have already adverted to one Scotch bridge; I now have to mention
another, viz., the Tay Bridge, also now in course of construction.
Here the cylinders are sunk, while being guided, through wrought-iron
pontoons, which are floated to their berths, and are then secured at
the desired spot by the protrusion, hydraulically, of four legs, which
bear upon the bottom, and thus, until they are withdrawn, convert the
pontoon from a floating into a fixed structure.


SUBAQUEOUS ENGINEERING.

I regret that time will not admit of my giving any description of the
modes of "cut and cover" which have been proposed for the performance
of subaqueous works; sometimes the proposition has been to do this
by means of coffer-dams, and with the work therefore open to the
day-light during execution, and sometimes by movable pneumatic
appliances. Consideration of subaqueous works necessarily leads the
mind to appliances for diving, and although its date is considerably
anterior to 1862, I feel tempted, as I believe the construction is
known to very few of our members, to say a few words about the diving
apparatus known as the "Bateau-plongeur," and used at the "barrage"
on the Nile. This consists of a barge fitted with an air-tight cabin
provided with an air-lock, and having in the center of its floor
a large oval opening, surrounded by a casing standing up above the
water-line. In this casing, another casing slides telescopically, the
upper part of which is connected to the top of the fixed casing by
a leather "sleeve." When it is desired to examine the bottom of the
river, the telescopic tube is lowered till it touches the bottom, and
then air is pumped into the cabin until the pressure is sufficient to
drive out the water, and thus to expose the bottom. This appears to be
a very convenient arrangement for shallow draughts of water.

Reverting for a moment to Mr. Stoney's work, I may mention that he
uses for the greatest depths he has to deal with, when preparing the
bed to receive his blocks, a diving apparatus which (while easily
accessible at all times) dispenses with the necessity of raising and
lowering, needed in an ordinary diving-bell to allow of the entrance
and exit of the workmen. Mr. Stoney employs a bell of adequate size,
from the summit of which rises a hollow cylinder, furnished at the
top with an air-lock, by which access can be obtained to the submerged
bell. Beyond the general improvement in detail and in the mode
of manufacture, and with the exception of the application of the
telephone, there is probably not much to be said in the way of
invention or progress in connection with the ordinary dress of the
diver.


THE FLEUSS DIVING APPARATUS.

But one great step has been made in the diver's art by the
introduction of the chemical system of respiration, the invention
of Mr. Fleuss. He has succeeded in devising a perfectly portable
apparatus, containing a chemical filter, by means of which the exhaled
