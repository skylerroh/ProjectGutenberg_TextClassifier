is equal to 3.785207 liters. The gallon of the State of New York is of
the capacity of 8 lbs. pure water at its maximum density, or
221.184 cubic inches. It is equal to 3.62346 liters."--_Appleton's

(33) S. C. D. says: Please give directions for electrotyping
cylindrical rollers for impressing upon sheets of wax, accurately,
of the proper figure for honeycomb foundations. The figure for the
surface of the cylinders to be derived from sheets of wax foundation,
having the figure correctly impressed upon them. A. This can be done
by coating with plumbago, and then electrotyping with copper, in a way
familiar to most printers and to all electrotyping establishments. The
plates can afterwards be bent round a roller, and used to impress the
sheets of wax.

(34) J. H. T. asks: There is a piece of ground, 100 rods long and 10
rods wide at one end, running to a point at the other, which we wish
to divide into 4 equal lots. Please give a rule. A. Let the 100 rods
be the base of a triangle, divide it into 4 parts of 25 rods each, and
join the apex with each of the three dividing points. You will then
have 4 triangles on equal bases and between the same parallels, which,
according to Euclid, are equal to each other.

(35) R. S. asks: What are the chemical qualities of bisulphide
of lime, and how can I prepare it? A. The bisulphide of calcium
(C_{2}S_{5}) is produced by boiling milk of lime with sulphur and
water, but not long enough to allow the lime to become completely
saturated. The filtered liquid, on cooling, deposits crystals whose
composition agrees with the formula C_{2}S_{2} + 3H_{2}O. Exposed to
the air, it soon absorbs oxygen, becoming converted into insoluble
sulphate of calcium. Its aqueous solutions are likewise decomposed.
Its reactions with the metallic salts are similar to those of the
alkaline sulphides.

(36) H. M. S. asks: 1. Of what is the bronze preparation made and how
is it applied to clock fronts? A. Bronze powders are made of various
metallic alloys. The gold bronze is usually made of Dutch gold
(an alloy of copper and zinc) and of the bisulphide of tin (_aurum
musivum_). They are usually applied to metal work by means of an oil
size or japan varnish. 2. In what way can I remove the old bronze? A.
Wash first with a solution of washing soda (hot), clean and dry, and
then rub with a little benzole, alcohol, or ether.

(37) W. E. W. asks: 1. Of what mixture is the bright red paint usually
put upon axes made? A. It consists of fine vermilion ground with
1 part boiled oil and 2 parts turpentine. 2. Is more than one coat
applied? A. One coat will suffice. It is best applied with a fine
brush, when the metal is warm.

(38) C. M. B. asks: Is the odor emitted by the ailanthus tree
unwholesome? A. It is considered so by many, but we have no proof as
to the facts.

(39) L. S. & Co. ask: Is there anything known which would clean the
hands from paints and lacquers without the use of turpentine? A. A
little ammonia and benzine or naphtha, aided by a little sand, is
often used in stubborn cases; put plenty of good soap and warm water,
with a stiff brush or a small piece of pumicestone, will ordinarily
suffice.

(40) W. P. S., Jr., says: Can you give me a recipe for making _papier
mache_? A. _Papier mache_ is obtained from old paper and the like made
into a pulp by grinding with milk of lime or lime water, and a little
gum dextrin or starch. This pulp is then pressed into form, coated
with linseed oil, baked at a high temperature, and finally varnished.
The pulp is sometimes mixed with clay (kaolin), chalk, etc.; and other
kinds are made of a paste of pulp and recently slaked lime. This is
used for ornamenting wood, etc.

(41) M. P. B. says, in reply to a correspondent who asked how to
prevent his water filter from getting choked up: Fit in the filter,
on the top of the charcoal, a piece of board having in the center a
circular hole from two to four inches in diameter, according to the
size of the filter; force in this a sponge so tightly that all the
water has to pass through it first, but not so as to prevent its free
passage. This sponge will absorb readily the gross impurities of the
water, and can easily be taken out and cleaned once or twice a week.

(42) A. C. S. asks: 1. Is there any reason why lightning rod points
should always be bright, if the points are kept sufficiently sharp? A.
It makes no difference if the points are not bright. 2. If lightning
rods put up in the ordinary way above the roof terminate in the eaves'
spouting of the house, and said spouting had good ground connections,
would this not be equal to the best lightning rod, and thereby save
many feet of rod and many dollars of expense? A. The arrangement you
suggest would be good. Make a thoroughly good ground connection with
leaders, have all joints well soldered, and you may dispense with the
rod as you propose.

(43) J. A. W. says: Having occasion to do some copper plating some
time ago, I dissolved sulphate of copper in water in a glass jar. I
then poured it off into my battery, and there was some left in the
jar. I threw a small piece of iron into it and left it for some days.
I then took it out; and to my surprise, I found that it had been
perfectly plated with copper. Please let me know the cause? A. The
reaction you note is taken advantage of to cheaply copper plate small
articles of cast iron. See answer to J. O. M., p. 347, vol. 36. In the
presence of water, the reaction is as follows:

     CuSO_{4}   +   Fe   =   FeSO_{4}   +   Cu.

Sulphate of copper. Iron. Sulphate of iron. Copper.

As the iron is a more positive metal than copper, it displaced the
latter in combination with acids, the remaining portions of the iron
becoming coated with the precipitated copper.

(44) A. G. asks: Is the silver, for a reflecting telescope, put on the
back of the glass the same as on looking glasses? A. No. Only one
side of the glass is ground and polished to the shape required. The
silvering is done on this side; and then, with the softest buckskin
and the finest rouge, the surface of the silver is polished for the
reflecting surface. In cities where gas is used, it will not retain
its brilliancy very long; then it requires to be cleaned with nitric
acid and resilvered, which is only the work of a few hours when a
person has become accustomed to it.

(45) A. L. B. says: 1. I understand that, in modern chemistry, the
acids and alkalies are the two extremes of a class of substances
called hydrates, the only difference being the radical. In the
reaction of nitric acid, HO NO_{2} or HNO_{3} on potassic hydrate, KOH
is KO NO_{2} or KNO_{3}, and H_{2}O. Which molecule loses the oxygen
atom, and why should one part with it more than the other?

A.    HNO_{3}    +    KOH      =    KNO_{3}  + H_{2}O
    Nitric acid      potassic       potassic    water
                     hydrate        nitrate

In this reaction the potassium is considered, by virtue of its greater
affinity, as replacing the hydrogen atom in the hydric nitrate; the
hydrogen in turn satisfying the OH group to form water. These hydrates
are similar only in point of constitution. Their chemical deportments
are widely different. 2. What are oxides in modern chemistry? A. The
bodies formed by the direct combination of oxygen with the elementary
bodies are called oxides. With water some of these oxides form
hydrates, as

    K_{2}O   +  H_{2}O = 2(KHO)
  potassium     water    potassic
    oxide                hydrate

(46) J. R. M. asks: To have a circular saw run well, should the
mandrel have a little end play if it is desired to relieve the saw
and guides of strain? A. If the saw is not true or the carriage runs
crooked, end play of the mandrel to the extent of the deviations will
relieve the strain upon the saw. But if the carriage runs true and the
saw true, the mandrel should have no end play.
