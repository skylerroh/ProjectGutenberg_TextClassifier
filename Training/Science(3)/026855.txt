    _There will be fine, glittering, streamlined automobiles in 2000
    A.D. Possibly they will run themselves while the driver sits back
    with an old-fashioned in his hands. Perhaps they will carry folks
    down the highways at ninety miles an hour in perfect safety. But
    picking up a hitch-hiker will still be as dangerous as it is today._

 HARD
 GUY

 By H. B. CARLETON


He was standing at the side of the glassite super-highway, his arm
half-raised, thumb pointed in the same direction as that of the
approaching rocket car. Ordinarily Frederick Marden would have passed a
hitch-hiker without stopping, but there was something in the bearing and
appearance of this one that caused him to apply his brakes.

Marden opened the door next to the vacant seat beside him.

"Going my way?" he asked.
