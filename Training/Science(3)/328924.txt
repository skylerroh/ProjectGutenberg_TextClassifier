ground, they could hardly believe their eyes. They chittered excitedly
as they skittered down the trunk. The page had hardly stopped fluttering
before it was whisked aloft again, clenched in tiny squix fingers.

The squixes wasted no time. It had been a long while since the most
cherished of all collector's items had come their way and they needed a
new hammock badly. First, they tore the page into strips, then they
began to weave the strips together.

_--1456, Gut. Bi. pr.; 1492, Am. dis.; 1945, at. b. ex. Almgdo.; 1971,
mn. rchd._, they wove.

_--2004, Sir. rchd.; 2005-6, Sir.--E. wr.; 2042, Btlgs. rchd.; 2043-4,
Btlgs.--E. wr._

They wove and wove and wove.

_15,000, E. Emp. clpsd.; 15,038, E. dstryd.; Hist. E., end of._

It was a fine hammock, the best the two squixes had ever wove. But they
didn't sleep well that night. They twisted and turned and tossed, and
they dreamed the most fantastic dreams--

Which isn't particularly surprising, considering what they were sleeping
on. Sleeping on the history of Earth would be enough to give anybody
nightmares.

Even squixes.
