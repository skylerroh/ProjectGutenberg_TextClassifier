Did dog houses have back doorways?

This one did, he saw, kneeling down and peering inside. A lovely back
doorway, rimmed with shimmering blue. It framed a familiar vista, in the
foreground of which a familiar green-rosebush stood. Beneath the
rosebush Zarathustra sat, wagging his tail.

It was a tight squeeze, but Philip made it. He even managed to get his
suitcase through. And just in time too, for hardly had he done so when
the doorway began to flicker. Now it was on its way out, and as he
watched, it faded into transparency and disappeared.

He crawled from beneath the rosebush and stood up. The day was bright
and warm, and the position of the sun indicated early morning or late
afternoon. No, not sun--suns. One of them was a brilliant blue-white
orb, the other a twinkling point of light.

He set off across the plain in Zarathustra's wake. He had a speech
already prepared, and when Judith met him at the gate with wide and
wondering eyes, he delivered it without preamble. "Judith," he said, "I
am contemptuous of the notion that some things are meant to be and
others aren't, and I firmly believe in my own free will; but when your
dog stows away in the back seat of my car two times running and makes
it impossible for me not to see you again, then there must be something
afoot which neither you nor I can do a thing about. Whatever it is, I
have given in to it and have transferred your real estate to an agent
more trustworthy than myself. I know you haven't known me long, and I
know I'm not an accepted member of your group, but maybe somebody will
give me a job raking lawns or washing windows or hoeing corn long enough
for me to prove that I am not in the least antisocial; and maybe, in
time, you yourself will get to know me well enough to realize that while
I have a weakness for blondes who look like Grecian goddesses, I have no
taste whatever for redheads, brunettes, or Cutty Sark. In any event, I
have burned my bridges behind me, and whether I ever become a resident
of Pfleugersville or not, I have already become a resident of Sirius
XXI."

Judith Darrow was silent for some time. Then, "This morning," she said,
"I wanted to ask you to join us, but I couldn't for two reasons. The
first was your commitment to sell our houses, the second was my
bitterness toward men. You have eliminated the first, and the second
seems suddenly inane." She raised her eyes. "Philip, please join us. I
want you to."

Zarathustra, whose real name was Siddenon Phenphonderill, left them
standing there in each other's arms and trotted down the street and out
of town. He covered the ground in easy lopes that belied his three
hundred and twenty-five years, and soon he arrived at the Meeting Place.
The mayors of the other villages had been awaiting him since early
morning and were shifting impatiently on their haunches. When he
clambered up on the rostrum they extended their audio-appendages and
retractile fingers and accorded him a round of applause. He extended his
own "hands" and held them up for silence, then, retracting them again,
he seated himself before the little lectern and began his report, the
idiomatic translation of which follows forthwith:

"Gentlemen, my apologies for my late arrival. I will touch upon the
circumstances that were responsible for it presently.

"To get down to the matter uppermost in your minds: Yes, the experiment
was a success, and if you will use your psycho-transmutative powers to
remodel your villages along the lines my constituents and I remodeled
ours and to build enough factories to give your 'masters' that sense of
self-sufficiency so essential to their well-being, and if you will
'plant' your disassembled Multiple Moebius-Knot Dynamos in such a way
that the resultant fields will be ascribed to accidental causes, you
will have no more trouble attracting personnel than we did. Just make
sure that your 'masters' quarters are superior to your own, and that
you behave like dogs in their presence. And when you fabricate your
records concerning your mythical departed masters, see to it that they
do not conflict with the records we fabricated concerning ours. It would
be desirable indeed if our Sirian-human society could be based on less
deceitful grounds than these, but the very human attitude we are
exploiting renders this impossible at the moment. I hate to think of the
resentment we would incur were we to reveal that, far from being the
mere dogs we seem to be, we are capable of mentally transmuting natural
resources into virtually anything from a key to a concert hall, and I
hate even more to think of the resentment we would incur were we to
reveal that, for all our ability in the inanimate field, we have never
been able to materialize so much as a single blade of grass in the
animate field, and that our reason for coincidentalizing the planet
Earth and creating our irresistible little utopias stems not from a need
for companionship but from a need for gardeners. However, you will find
that all of this can be ironed out eventually through the human
children, with whom you will be thrown into daily contact and whom you
will find to possess all of their parents' abiding love for us and none
of their parents' superior attitude toward us. To a little child, a dog
is a companion, not a pet; an equal, not an inferior--and the little
children of today will be the grown-ups of tomorrow.

"To return to the circumstances that occasioned my late arrival: I ... I
must confess, gentlemen, that I became quite attached to the 'mistress'
into whose house I sought entry when we first established our field and
who subsequently adopted me when I convinced her real dog that he would
find greener pastures elsewhere. So greatly attached did I become, in
fact, that when the opportunity of ostracizing her loneliness presented
itself, I could not refrain from taking advantage of it. The person to
whom she was most suited and who was most suited to her appeared
virtually upon her very doorstep; but in her stubbornness and in her
pride she aggravated rather than encouraged him, causing him to rebel
against the natural attraction he felt toward her. I am happy to report
that, by means of a number of subterfuges--the final one of which
necessitated the use of our original doorway--I was able to set this
matter right, and that these two once-lonely people are about to embark
upon a relationship which in their folklore is oftentimes quaintly
alluded to by the words, 'They lived happily ever after.'

"And now, gentlemen, the best of luck to you and your constituents, and
may you end up with servants as excellent as ours. I hereby declare this
meeting adjourned."
