"Look!" he screamed, above the uproar. "I am a man, like yourselves!
Do not kill!"

Next second he froze in his tracks. The next he was writhing in the
death agony, and the bees were supreme once more.

Supreme herself had stung Deltos.






XV

OVERLOOKED





Of the four on the earth, Smith was the first to make any comment.
He had considerable difficulty in throwing his thought to the
others; somehow he felt slightly dazed.

"This is--unbelievable!" he said, and repeated it twice. "To think
that those insects are still the masters!"

"I wish"--Billie's voice shook somewhat--"I wish almost that I had
let you warn Rolla. It might have helped--" She broke off suddenly,
intent upon something Supreme was hearing. "Just listen!"

"Quick!" a lieutenant was humming excitedly to the commandant. "Back
to the hives; give the order, Supreme!"

It was done, and immediately the bees quit the throng of natives and
their victims, rushing at top speed for their precious city. As they
went, Supreme demanded an explanation.

"What is the meaning of this?"

For answer the lieutenant pointed her antennae straight ahead. At
first Supreme could see nothing in the growing darkness; then she
saw that some of the sky was blacker than the rest. Next she caught
a faint glow.

"Supreme, the deadly flower has come to the hives!"

It was true! In ten minutes the city was near enough for the
commandant to see it all very clearly. The fire had started on the
windward side, and already had swept through half the hives!

"Quick!" the order was snapped out. "Into the remaining houses, and
save the young!"

She herself led the horde. Straight into the face of the flames they
flew, unquestioningly, unhesitantly. What was self, compared with
the Hive?

Next moment, like a mammoth billow, the smoke rolled down upon them
all. And thus it came about that the villagers, making their
cautious way toward the bee city, shouted for joy and danced as they
had never danced before, when they saw what had happened.

Not a bee was left alive. Every egg and larva was destroyed; every
queen was burned. And every last soldier and worker had lost her
life in the vain attempt at rescue. Suddenly one of the villagers,
who had been helping to carry Corrus and Dulnop to the spot, pointed
out something on the other side of the fire! It was Rolla!

"Hail!" she shouted, hysterical with happiness as she ran toward her
people. Cunora was close upon her heels. "Hail to the flowing
flower!"

She held up a torch. Down fell the villagers to their knees. Holla
strode forward and found Corrus, even as Cunora located her Dulnop.

"Hail to the flowing flower!" shouted Rolla again. "And hail to the
free people of this world! A new day cometh for us all! The
masters--are no more!"

The four on the earth looked at each other inquiringly. There was a
heavy silence. The doctor stood it as long as he could, and then
said:

"So far as I'm concerned, this ends our investigations." They stared
at him uncomprehendingly; he went on: "I don't see anything to be
gained by this type of study. Here we've investigated the conditions
on two planets pretty thoroughly, and yet we can't agree upon what
we've learned!

"Van still thinks that the upper classes should rule, despite all
the misery we saw on Capellette! And Billie is still convinced that
the working classes, and no others, should govern! This, in the face
of what we've just--seen! Sanus is absolute proof of what must
happen when one class tries to rule; conflict, bloodshed,
misery--little else! Besides"--remembering something, and glancing
at his watch--"besides, it's time for dinner."

Billie and Smith got to their feet, and in silence quit the room
Billie and Van Emmon were still fumbling with their bracelets. The
two young people rose from the chairs at the same time and started
across the room to put flip bracelets away. The wire which connected
them trailed in between and caught on the doctor's chair. It brought
the two of them up short.

Van Emmon stared at the wire. He gave it a little tug. The chair did
not move. Billie gave an answering jerk, with similar lack of
results. Then they glanced swiftly at one another, and each stepped
back enough to permit lifting the wire over the chair.

"In other words," Van Emmon stammered, with an effort to keep his
voice steady--"in other words, Billie, we both had to give in a
little, in order to get past that chair!"

Then he paused slightly, his heart pounding furiously.

"Yes Van." She dropped the bracelets. "And--as for me--Van, I didn't
really want to see the bees win! I only pretended to--I wanted to
make you--think!"

"Billie! I'll say 'cooperate' if you will!"

"Cooperate!"

He swept her into his arms, and held her so close that she could not
see what had rushed to his eyes. "Speaking of cooperation," he
remarked unsteadily, "reminds me--it takes two to make a kiss!"

They proceeded to experiment.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
