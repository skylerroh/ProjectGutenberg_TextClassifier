were Jennies too valuable?) So they gave me a commission in the reserve
and loaned me to Herbert Hoover--for the duration, as it turned out.

In pursuit of my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees I worked under Charles E.
Munroe, probably the greatest high-explosives man yet to live. Got
'em--the M.S. in 1917, the Ph.D. in 1918; both from George Washington
University.

Chief Chemist F. W. Stock & Sons, Hillsdale, Mich., from 1919 to 1936;
where I developed a line of fully-prepared cereal mixes; the most
important of which turned out to be donut mixes. From 1936 to 1941 I
was production manager for the Dawn Donut Co., of Jackson, Mich.

Shortly after Pearl Harbor I went to Kingsbury Ordnance Plant, LaPorte,
Ind., as chemical engineer on high explosives. (I was one year over age
for reinstatement of my World War One commission). Senior chemical
engineer, assistant chief, chief. Late in 1943 I was made head of the
Inspection Division, and early in 1944 I was fired. Most of 1944 and
most of 1945 I worked in various capacities on light farm machinery and
heavy tanks for Allis-Chalmers.

On Oct. 1, 1945, I came to Chicago as manager of the Cereal Mix
Division of J. W. Allen & Co., which position I still hold. It's the
biggest and best job I ever had. It has only one drawback--on it,
unfortunately, I not only can't write stories on company time, but
(since I have to concentrate my one-cylinder brain on SF in order to
write SF) I can't write on my own time because the job gets in the way.

Thus, I haven't done much writing since 1945. However, I hope to do
more of it from now on. For, although I am only an amateur--or at best,
a semi-pro--author, I certainly do not want to become an ex-author!
