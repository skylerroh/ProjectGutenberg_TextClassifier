By RUSS WINTERBOTHAM

It seems unnecessary to say that my story began a long time ago, but I
do not intend to be subtle. I am not clever and my lying is unpolished,
almost amateurish. So I certainly could not be subtle, which requires
both cleverness and an ability to tell the truth and a lie in the same
breath.

Let us turn back the clock a few ages. I was lying in the sun thinking
of love. I understand that you human beings have an aversion to
biological discussion, so I will not go into detail. But I must remind
you that my love life is quite different from yours, for I am from
another planet. At the time under discussion, I was most deeply in love.
