In this instance the barrenness of the soil is distinctly traceable to
the deficiency of phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, and chlorine. There
is also a remarkably large quantity of oxide of iron, which, when acted
on by the humic acid, is well known to be highly prejudicial to
vegetation, and that this took place was shown by the fact that the
drains, a couple of months after being laid, were almost stopped up by
humate of iron. Still more striking are the following analyses:--

The results contained in these analyses are peculiarly remarkable, for
they indicate the almost total absence of all those substances which the
plant requires. They must, however, be considered as in a great measure
exceptional cases, as it is but rarely that so large a number of
constituents is absent, and it is much more frequent to find the
deficiency restricted to one or two substances. They are illustrations
of barrenness dependent on different circumstances. The first shows the
unimportance of the organic matters of the soil, which are here
unusually abundant, without in any way counteracting the infertility
dependent on the absence of the other constituents. The second is that
of a nearly pure sand; and the third, though it contains a greater
number of the essential ingredients of the ash, is still rendered
unfruitful by the deficiency of alkalies, sulphuric acid, and chlorine.

An examination of the foregoing analyses indicates pretty clearly some
of the conditions of fertility of the soil, which must obviously
contain all the constituents of the plants destined to grow upon it. But
it by no means exhausts the subject, for numerous instances are known of
soils containing all the essential elements of plants in abundance, but
on which they nevertheless refuse to grow. In these instances the defect
is due either to the presence of some substance injurious to the plant,
or to the state of combination of those it requires being such as to
prevent their absorption. Reference has been already made to the bad
effects of protoxide of iron, and it would appear that organic matter is
sometimes injurious. Even water, by excluding air, and so preventing
those decompositions which play so important a part in liberating the
essential elements from their more permanent compounds, although it
cannot render a soil absolutely barren, not unfrequently materially
diminishes its fertility.

The state of combination of the soil constituents unquestionably
exercise a most important influence on its fertility. That this must be
the case is an inference which may be easily drawn from the statements
already made regarding the different minerals from which it is directly
or indirectly produced. If, for instance, a soil consist to a large
extent of mica, it would be found on analysis to contain abundance of
potash and some other matters, and yet our knowledge of the difficulty
with which that mineral is decomposed, would enable us to pronounce
unfavourably of the soil; and practical experience here fully confirms
the scientific inference.

The forms of combination most favourable to fertility is a subject on
which our information is at present comparatively limited. It was at one
time believed that solubility in water was an indispensable requisite,
but recent investigations appear to lead to a directly contrary
conclusion. The analyses of soils already given, show that the part
directly soluble in water embraces only a certain number of the
constituents of the plant, and of those dissolved the quantity is very
small. This becomes still more apparent if we estimate from the analyses
the actual quantities of those substances contained in an acre of soil.
It is generally assumed that the soil on an imperial acre of land 10
inches deep weighs in round numbers about 1000 tons; and calculating
from this, we find that the quantity of potash soluble in water in the
Mid-Lothian wheat soil, amounts to no more than 70 lb. per acre. But a
crop of hay carries off from the soil about 38 lb. of potash, and one of
turnips, including tops, not less than 200 lb., so that if only the
matters soluble in water could be taken up by the plant, such soils
could not possess the amount of fertility which they are actually found
to have.

It is to be remembered, also, that in these analyses the experiment is
made under the most favourable circumstances for ascertaining the whole
quantity of matters which are capable of dissolving in water; that
practically dissolved is very different. The recent analysis by Krocker
and Way of the drainage water of soils afford a means of estimating
this. Way found in one gallon of the drainage water from seven different
fields, collected in the end of December--

Some of the soils from which these waters were obtained had been manured
with unusually large quantities of nitrogenous matters, which accounts
for the large amount of nitric acid, as well as the lime which that acid
has extracted. Dr. Krocker's analyses were made on soils less highly
manured, and the water was collected in summer.

In order to obtain from these experiments an estimate of the quantity of
the substances actually dissolved, we shall select the results obtained
by Way. The average rainfall in Kent, where the waters he examined were
obtained, is 25 inches. Now, it appears that about two-fifths of all the
rain which falls escapes through the drains, and the rest is got rid of
by evaporation. An inch of rain falling on an imperial acre weighs
rather more than a hundred tons; hence, in the course of a year, there
must pass off by the drains about 1000 tons of drainage water, carrying
with it, out of the reach of the plants, such substances as it has
dissolved, and 1500 tons must remain to give to the plant all that it
holds in solution. These 1500 tons of water must, if they have the same
composition as that which escapes, contain only two and a half pounds of
potash, and less than a pound of ammonia. It may be alleged that the
water which remains, lying longer in contact with the soil, may contain
a larger quantity of matters in solution; but even admitting this to be
the case, it cannot for a moment be supposed that they can ever amount
to more than a very small fraction of what is required for a single
crop. It may therefore be stated with certainty that solubility in water
is not essential to the absorption of substances by the plant, which
must possess the power of itself directly attacking, acting chemically
on, and dissolving them. The mode in which it does this is entirely
unknown, but it in all probability depends on very feeble chemical
actions, and hence the importance of having the soil constituents, not
in solution, but in such a state that they may be readily made soluble
by the plants. Many of the minerals from which fertile soils are formed
are probably not attackable by plants when in their natural condition,
and even after disintegration the quantity of the essential elements of
their food, which are present in an easily assimilable state, is at no
one time very large. But this is of comparatively little importance, for
the soil is not an inert unchangeable substance; it is the theatre of an
important series of chemical changes effected by the action of air and
moisture, and producing a continued liberation of its constituents. This
decomposition is effected partly by the carbonic acid of the atmosphere,
but to a much larger extent by its oxygen acting upon the organic
matters of the soil, and causing a constant though slow evolution of
that acid, which in its turn attacks the mineral matters. Boussingault
and Levy have illustrated the extent of this action by examining the
composition of the air contained in the pores of different soils, and
have obtained the following results:--

From these analyses it appears that the air contained in the pores of
the soil is much richer in carbonic acid than the atmosphere, the
poorest soil containing about 25 times, and a recently manured soil 250
times as much. This carbonic acid, which is obviously produced by the
decomposition of the vegetable matters and manure, acting partly as gas
and partly dissolved in the soil water, exerts a solvent action on its
constituents. And, though a very feeble acid, its continuous action
produces in the course of time a large effect; while, during the
interval, the constituents of the soil are safely stored up, and
liberated only as the plant requires them, by which bountiful provision
of nature they are exposed to fewer risks of loss than if they had been
all along in a state in which they could be absorbed. Carbonic acid not
only assists in effecting the decomposition of the minerals of the soil,
but its aqueous solution acts as a solvent of many substances, which
are quite insoluble in pure water. It is in this way that much of the
lime contained in natural waters is held in solution, and it has been
ascertained that magnesia, iron, and even phosphate of lime, may also be
dissolved by it. It is probable that when these substances are
dissolved, the plants will take them from solution in place of
themselves attacking the insoluble matters; but of the extent to which
this may occur nothing is yet known--the action of solvents on the soil
being a subject which is as yet scarcely examined.

Carbonic acid is, however, a most important agent in producing the
chemical changes in the soil, and the particular value of humus lies in
its affording a supply of that substance exactly when it is wanted; but
the carbonic acid of the atmosphere also takes part in these changes,
although with different degrees of rapidity according to the character
of the soil, acting rapidly in light, and slowly in stiff, clay soils.
The solvent action of the carbonic acid is, no doubt, principally
exerted on the substances soluble in acids, but not entirely, for it is
known that the insoluble part is gradually being disintegrated and made
soluble; and hence it is that the composition of that part of the soil
which resists the action of acids, and which at first sight might appear
of no moment, is really important. It is obvious that this circumstance
must at once confer on the soil of the Carse of Gowrie a great
superiority over those of Mid-Lothian and most other districts; for it
contains in its insoluble part a quantity of alkalies which must
necessarily form a source of continued fertility. Accordingly,
experience has all along shown the great superiority of that soil, and
of alluvial soils generally, which are all more or less similar to it.
The facility with which these matters are attackable by carbonic acid is
also an important element of the fertility of a soil, and it is to the
existence of compounds which are readily decomposed by it that we
attribute the high fertility of the trap soils.

By a further examination of the analyses of fertile soils, it is at once
apparent that the most essential constituents of plants are by no means
very abundant in them. In fact, phosphoric and sulphuric acids, lime,
magnesia, and the alkalies, which in most instances make up nine-tenths
of the ash of plants, form but a small portion of even the most fertile
soils; while silica, which, except in the grasses, occurs in small
quantity, oxide of iron which is a limited, and alumina a rare,
constituent of the ash, constitute by far their larger part. Thus the
total amount of potash, soda, lime, magnesia, phosphoric and sulphuric
acids and chlorine, contained in the Mid-Lothian wheat soil amounts only
to 3.5888 per cent, and in the Perthshire to 6.4385, the entire
remainder being substances which enter into the plant for the most part
in much smaller quantity. And, as these small quantities of the more
important substances are capable of supplying the wants of the plant, it
must be obvious that a very small fraction of the silica, oxide of iron,
and alumina, which the soils contain, would afford to it the whole
quantity of these substances it requires, and that the remainder must
have some other functions to perform.

The soil must be considered not merely as the source of the inorganic
food of plants, for it has to act also as a support for them while
growing, and to retain a sufficient quantity of moisture to support
their life; and unless it possess the properties which fit it for this
purpose, it may contain all the elements of the food of plants, and yet
be nearly or altogether barren.

The adaptation of the soil to this function is dependent to a great
extent on its mechanical texture, and on this considerable light is
frequently thrown by a kind of mechanical analysis.

If a soil be shaken up with water and allowed to stand for a few
minutes, it rapidly deposits a quantity of grains which are at once
recognised as common sand; and if the water be then poured off into
another vessel and allowed to stand for a longer time, a fine soft
powder, having the properties and composition of common clay, is
deposited, while the clear fluid retains the soluble matters. By a more
careful treatment it is possible to distinguish and separate humus, and
in soils lying on chalk or limestone, calcareous matter or carbonate of
lime.

In this way the components can be classified into four groups, a mixture
of two or more of which in variable proportions is found in all soils.

The relative proportions in which these substances exist in soils are,
as we shall afterwards see, the foundation of their classification into
the light, heavy, calcareous, and other sub-divisions. But they are also
intimately connected with certain chemical and mechanical peculiarities
which have an important bearing on its fertility. It is a familiar fact,
that particular soils are specially adapted to the growth of certain
crops; and we talk of a wheat or a turnip soil as readily
distinguishable. It is to be observed, however, that in many such
instances the mere analysis may show no difference, or, at least, none
sufficient to account for the peculiarity. A remarkable illustration is
offered by the following analyses of two soils, on one of which red
clover grows luxuriantly, while on the other it invariably fails.

                           Clover fails.  Clover succeeds.

In this instance such difference as exists is rather in favour of the
soil on which clover fails, but it is exceedingly trifling; and it is
necessary to seek an explanation in the special properties of its
mechanical constituents.

These properties are partly mechanical and partly chemical, and in both
ways exercise an important influence on the fertility of the soil.

Sand and clay, the most important of the mechanical constituents, confer
on the soil diametrically opposite properties; the former, when present
in large quantity, producing what are designated as light, the latter
stiff or heavy soils. The hard indestructible siliceous grains, of which
sand is composed, form a soil of an open texture, through which water
readily permeates; while clay, from its fine state of division, and
peculiar adhesiveness or plasticity, gives it a close-textured and
retentive character, and their proper intermixture produces a light
fertile loam, each tempering the peculiar properties of the other.
Indeed, their mixture is manifestly essential, for sand alone contains
little or none of the essential ingredients of plants; and if present in
large quantity, the openness of the soil is excessive, water flows
through it with rapidity, manures are rapidly wasted, and on the
accession of drought, the plants growing upon it soon languish and die.
Clay, on the other hand, is by itself equally objectionable; the
closeness of its texture prevents the spreading of the roots of plants,
and the access of carbonic acid, which, as we have already seen, is so
important an agent in the changes occurring in the soil. In fact, a pure
clay, that is to say, a clay unmixed with sand, even though it may
contain all the essential constituents of the plant, is for this reason
unfertile. Practically, of course, these extreme cases rarely occur; the
heaviest clay soils being mixtures of true clay with sand, and the most
sandy containing their proportion of clay; but frequently the
preponderance of the one over the other is so great, as to produce soils
greatly inferior to those in which the mixture is more uniform.

It is easy to understand how the proportions in which sand and clay are
mixed must affect the suitability of soils to particular crops, and that
an open soil must be favourable to the turnip, and a heavy clay, owing
to the resistance it offers to the expansion of the bulbs, unfavourable.
But these substances also exercise an important chemical action on the
soluble constituents of the food of plants, combining with them, and
converting them into an insoluble, or nearly insoluble state, so as to
prevent their being washed away by the rain or other water which
percolates through the soil. It has long been known to chemists that
clay has a tendency to absorb a small proportion of ammonia, and even
when brought up from a great depth frequently contains that substance.
It is to Mr. Thompson of Moat Hall, however, that we owe the important
observation, that arable soils rapidly remove ammonia from solution, and
Way, who pursued this investigation, showed that not only ammonia, but
potash, and several of the other important elements of the food of
plants, are thus absorbed. The removal of these substances from solution
is easily illustrated by a simple experiment. It suffices to take a tall
cylindrical vessel open at both ends, and filled with the soil to be
