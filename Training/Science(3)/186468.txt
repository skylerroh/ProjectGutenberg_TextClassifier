But he evidently laid his trouble entirely to the black man, and he
threw himself forward along the ice, smashing it to bits, and gnashing
at it with his tusks. In half a minute he would have been on the spot
where the negro lay had not the boys run in swiftly and pumped a dozen
bullets into his eyes and down his open mouth. By good luck more than
good management they killed the beast.

"See wot yo' done done!" wailed Washington White, rising gingerly and
with a hand upon the small of his back. "Yo' come near ter spilein'
Perfesser Henderson's most impo'tant assistant. How do you 'speck de
perfesser c'd git erlong widout me?"

This was certainly an unanswerable question, and the boys admitted it.
They were sorry Wash had been so badly frightened, but they were
delighted at the possession of the tusks of the walrus. The whalers
secured the body, too, and made a very good quality of oil out of
the blubber.

In hunting adventures, and in the labor of trying-out the whale blubber,
several weeks passed. The marooned scientist and his friends, with the
crew of the whale ship, experienced some bad weather during this time.
For three entire days a terrible snowstorm raged--a blizzard that
drifted the snow about the _Orion_ (which had chanced, when she was
stranded, to settle on a perfectly even keel) until one could walk
over her rail out upon the bottom of the sea.

But when this storm passed over the sun came out and shone as tropically
as ever. The snow melted very rapidly and the old sea bed was soon
awash. The beasts and fish still alive in the sinks were enabled to
reach the streams running out of the various mouths of the Coleville,
and these creatures took to deep water.

"By Jo!" ejaculated Captain Sproul, "give us a leetle more water and
we'd sail the old _Orion_ after them, and reach the open sea again."

He had every belief that the ocean would return to its former bed, and
his crew believed it, too. But Professor Henderson and the boys
seriously discussed making some move from this locality.

It was plain that there was still plenty of game 'along the shore of
the old ocean, and they had about made up their mind to follow the
edge of the shore toward Bering Sea and if possible find the revenue
cutter _Bear_, when another storm broke over them. No snow fell
this time. There was almost continual thunder and a downpour of rain
and hail that was sufficient to smother anybody that ventured out upon
the deck of the _Orion_. The new planet seemed to be in the throes
of another eruption, too.

Lightning lit the waste about them with intermittent flashes. They had
lost sight entirely of the old earth, of the moon, and of the sun. It
seemed to Jack and Mark as though this tiny island in the air must be
flying through space again, buffeted by every element.

The wind wailed and screamed about the whaleship. There were more than
sixty souls aboard and they crouched in the cabin and in the forecastle
and knew not what to make of such a foray of the elements. At one
moment the rain flooded down upon the decks as though a cloud had burst
directly above them; then great hailstones fell, drumming on the planks
like musket balls.

The calmest person among them all was Professor Henderson. Captain
Sproul had given the aged scientist the use of the small chart-room.
There he had set up certain of his instruments, and he hovered over
these most of his waking hours, making innumerable calculations from
time to time. During the awful turmoil of the elements he watched his
instruments without sleep. The boys remained with him most of the time,
for they realized that some catastrophe was threatening which the
scientist feared but did not wish to explain at once.

Suddenly Captain Sproul burst into the chart-room and gasped:

"Can you tell me the meaning of this, Mr. Henderson? You're a scientific
sharp and know a whole lot of things. My cook just went to the galley
door to throw out a pot of slops and something--some mysterious
force--snatched the heavy iron pot out of his hand and it went sailing
off over the ship's rail. Can you explain that?"

"Wasn't it the wind snatched it away?" asked Jack Darrow, before the
professor was ready to answer.

"Don't seem to be no wind blowing just at present," said Captain Sproul.

"Wait!" commanded the professor. "Order every companionway and hatch
closed. Do not allow a man to go on deck, nor to open a deadlight. We
must exist upon the air that remains in the vessel for the present."

"What do you mean?" gasped the skipper.

"There is no air outside!" declared Professor Henderson, solemnly. "We
are flying through space where no atmosphere exists. The iron pot
merely remained poised in space--our planet, far, far, heavier, is
falling through this awful void."

"What sort o' stuff are you talkin'?" demanded Captain Sproul, growing
positively white beneath his tan.

"We began to fall several minutes ago," said the professor, pointing
to the indicator of one of the delicate instruments before him on the
chart table. "The balance of attraction between the earth and the sun
has become disturbed and we are plunging--"

"Into the sun?" shrieked Mark Sampson, springing to his feet.

"No! no! Toward the earth! Toward the earth!" reiterated Professor
Henderson. "Her attraction has proved the greater. We are falling with
frightful velocity toward the sphere from which we were blown off into
space so many weeks ago."

"I reckon I'm crazy," groaned Captain Sproul "I hear you folks talkin',
but I don't understand a thunderin' word you say."

"You can feel that the air in here is vitiated; can't you?" demanded
Professor Henderson.

The boys had already felt that it was more difficult to breathe. They
heard cries all over the ship. Washington White burst into the room,
crying: "Oh, lawsy-massy me, Perfesser! We is done bein' smothercated.
De breaf am a-leabin' our bodies fo' suah."

The negro fell in a swoon, overturning the table and sending the
professor's instruments crashing to the floor. The others, struggling
for breath, likewise sank beside Wash. The lights all over the ship
were suddenly snuffed out. Every soul aboard lost consciousness as,
rushing at unreckoned speed through the universe, the torn-away world
descended toward its parent planet.

How long they were unconscious none of the survivors ever learned.
When they _did_ finally struggle to sense again, it was with the sound
of the rushing of mighty waters in their ears.

The _Orion_ was afloat! She was being tossed upon the bosom of a
wind-lashed ocean, and a hurricane, the like of which the two boys
had never experienced before, was at its height.

Captain Sproul rose to his feet, panting for breath, but with his
senses all alert. He shouted:

"The sea has rolled back again! What did I tell you? Up and at it, my
bully boys! Get a sail upon her so's we can have steering way. Every
ile barrel is full and we're homeward bound!"

The hatches were opened and they rushed on deck. It was so black that
they could see nothing but the storm-tossed waves--not a sign of land.
But it was plain, too, that they were no longer on the lee shore. They
had plenty of sea room to work the ship and the brave sailors went
about their usual tasks with cheerfulness.




CHAPTER XXX

AN ENDURING MONUMENT--CONCLUSION


But Professor Henderson and the boys, as well as Andy Sudds and
Washington, gathered in the chart room. The aged scientist was confident
that during their period of unconsciousness the fragment of the earth
that had once been shot off into space, had returned to its parent
globe, and he spoke cheerfully of their probable escape.

"But have we descended into the very place we left?" demanded Mark.

"Scarcely probable," returned the professor.

"Nevertheless the ocean has returned to this spot," declared Jack.

"There is water here, yes," admitted the professor. "We are afloat, that
is true."

"And is it not the Arctic Ocean?"

"Later I will tell you. They say there is no land in sight. I believe
the bulk of the land which was shot off by the volcanic eruption has
now sunk in this sea. What sea it is we can tell soon."

"When can we see the sun and take an observation?" queried Mark.
"Perhaps finding the temperature of this ocean which surrounds us will
tell us something. However, we must have patience until this bitter
storm is past."

And this did call for patience, for the hurricane continued for fully
a week. Meanwhile the Orion ran on under almost bare poles, and in a
northwesterly direction. This course, Captain Sproul believed, would
bring them to Bering Sea, and their homeward route.

But a vast and amazing discovery awaited the hardy navigator of the
whaling bark when the wind finally died down, the clouds were swept
away, and the sun again appeared. Professor Henderson appeared on deck,
too, and calculated their position side by side with Captain Sproul.
The latter's amazement was unbounded. His calculations, no matter how
he worked them, made the position of the _Orion_ 148 degrees west of
Greenwich and 49 degrees north.

In other words, he was far, far south of the Alaskan Peninsula. During
this awful storm he had traversed (or so he was bound to believe) a
long stretch of the Arctic Ocean, Bering Sea and Strait, had passed
the Aleutian Islands, and was now more than a thousand miles south of
the position of the _Orion_ when she first became stranded.

The professor endeavored to explain to him again what had really
happened--that the fragment of the earth on which they had been marooned
had plunged into the old earth again, landing by great good fortune
in the empty sea between North America and Asia--in the North Pacific.

Such an explanation seemed utterly ridiculous to Captain Sproul, to
his seamen, and even to Phineas Roebach. They were convinced that
Professor Henderson was in his dotage. They would rather believe that
the _Orion_, sailing on pretty nearly a straight course according
to the compass, had traversed this enormous distance during the
hurricane.

The professor and his young friends, however, had studied too deeply
the mystery of this astounding affair to be mistaken. All the phenomena
of the experience had been noted by Professor Henderson. He had the
material of a most remarkable work in his notebooks, and that volume
will soon appear to delight the scientific world.

Meanwhile the _Orion_ changed her course and ran for San Francisco
to re-provision. She had a very valuable cargo of oil which she would
later take around the Horn to her home port, New Bedford.

At San Francisco, however, Professor Henderson, Jack and Mark, with
Andy and Wash and Phineas Roebach, left the ship. Roebach was to report
to his oil company and probably return to Alaska to continue his search
for petroleum. Our friends started overland for home, stopping off at
the city where Dr. Artemus Todd resided to explain to that savant the
reason for their inability to secure a single specimen of the
_Chrysothele-Byzantium_, which herb the doctor was so confident
would be of incalculable value in treating patients suffering from
aphasia, amnesia, and kindred troubles.

Perhaps the disappointed doctor was not entirely sure that his friend,
Professor Henderson, and his comrades, had gone through the strange
experience which they recounted. But a few weeks later several vessels
reported sighting a new island in the North Pacific, south of the
Alaskan Peninsula. On this island men who landed discovered a colony
of Kodiak bears, some Arctic foxes, and the remains of vegetation which
had never before been found south of the Arctic Circle.

This discovery created vast talk among the geographers and scientists.
An exploring party was sent out by the Smithsonian Institution to
examine the new island. It was pronounced of volcanic origin, yet the
formation of it was not of recent time. There was on this island (which
contained several square miles) the remains of a glacier, and in the
ice the party discovered the wreck of a wonderful flying machine, which
had evidently been built within a few months.

Of course, this was the _Snowbird_, the aeroplane which our friends
had been obliged to abandon. But by that time Jack and Mark had built
another flying machine on the same lines as the one which they had
lost in the crevasse of the glacier.

The professor proceeded to explain and prove all this in his book; but
there will always be certain doubters. Washington White, however, was
more disturbed than any of the party over the fact that everybody would
not accept as true the scientist's account of their wonderful voyage
on a torn-away world.

"De stupendous and unprecedented gall some folks has is suttenly beyond
comparination!" exploded Wash. "Dere is folks dat ain't nebber been
to Bawston, eben, dat dares say dat we didn't go ter Alaska in a flyin'
masheen, an' den fly away wid a piece ob dat kentry inter de
cimcum-ambient air--droppin' back on de same w'en we'd got t'roo wid
it, an' landin' right outside de harbor of San Francisco. Dey won't
belieb it at all, not eben w'en I proves it to 'em."

"And how do you prove it to your friends, Wash?" queried Jack Darrow.

"By Buttsy," declared the darkey, gravely.

"By the Shanghai?"

"Yes, sah. By Christopher Columbus Amerigo Vespucci George Washington
Abraham Lincoln Ulysses Grant Garibaldi Thomas Edison Guglielmo Marconi
Butts."

"And how do you prove it by Christopher Columbus And-so-forth?" demanded
the chums, in chorus.

"Why," said Wash, rolling his eyes, "I done tooked dat rooster wid me
in all ma trabels; didn't I?"

"You most certainly did," admitted Mark.

"And a big nuisance he was," added Jack.

Wash loftily overlooked this remark. He said, confidently:

"And I brought Buttsy back ergin; didn't I?"

"You did. He's getting fat and sassy right now out in his coop behind
the bungalow."

"Well den!" cried Wash. "I done took him wid me, an' I done brought
him back. Wot furder elimination ob de fac's does dem folks want? Don't
Buttsy crowin' away dar prove it?"

And Washington White walked off with his head held very high as though
he had made a perfectly unanswerable statement of the case.

And here we will say good bye to our friends, who had so many thrilling
adventures while drifting through space On a Torn-Away World.
