       _Psychopathology has offered possible answers to why, from
       time to time, people in large quantities "see" strange
       things in the sky which manage to evade trained scientific
       observers, or conform to what is known about the behavior
       of falling or flying bodies. And mass hysteria is by no
       means a product of the present century. But--what if these
       human foibles were deliberately being exploited?_


                          THE FOURTH INVASION

Dr. Clayton's face was impassive as a marble mask when he turned to
young Corelli. For a moment, the little group stood there in embarrassed
silence in the classroom, shifting uneasily from one foot to the other,
feigning interest in the paperweights upon Clayton's desk, or in the
utterly uninspiring scenes on the sidewalk outside the window.

"You say, Corelli, that you saw three--er, Martian--ships. Can you
describe them?"
