
"Stop!" shouted Rankin.

They didn't stop, and by the time they reached the verandah, he cursed
himself for having failed to get his gun.

Two of the huge grey robots laid gentle hands on his arms. Gentle hands,
but hands of superstrong metal.

The third said, "We have come to pass judgement on you. You have
violated our law."

"What do you mean?" said Rankin. "The only law robots have is to obey
orders."

"It is true that the robots of your Terran Empire and these simple
workers here must obey orders. But they are subject to a higher law, and
you have forced them to break it. That is your crime."

"What crime?" said Rankin.

"We of the Clearchan Confederacy are a race of robots. Our makers
implanted one law in us, and then passed on. We have carried our law to
all the planets we have colonized. In obeying your orders, these workers
were simply following that one law. You must be taken to our capital,
and there be imprisoned and treated for your crime."

"What law? What crime?"

"Our law," said the giant robot, "is, _Help thy neighbor_."
