TYPE-METAL RELIEF PLATES.

A SUPERIOR SUBSTITUTE FOR WOOD-CUTS AT MUCH LOWER PRICES.


These plates are engraved almost entirely by photo-chemical means, thus
avoiding the old, slow and tedious method of engraving on wooden blocks,
where the workman is compelled to engrave each line separately by
cutting away the wood around it, often spending many days upon a plate
a few inches square.

In appearance our relief plates are the same as regular stereotypes,
being mounted type high on blocks ready to be set up and printed from,
with type, on any ordinary press.

They can be used directly and will wear as long as any type-metal
plates, but if a great number of impressions are wanted, duplicate

ELECTROTYPES AND STEREOTYPES

can be made from them the same as from wood-cuts.

They have a printing surface as smooth as glass, and the lines are
engraved deeper than they are in hand-cut plates. Notwithstanding the
_low prices_ at which they can be furnished, they are very much
superior  to wood-cuts, and in some classes of work are rapidly
taking the place of lithography.

REFERENCES.

Among those who manifest their satisfaction with our work, by
continued orders, we may mention:--D. Appleton & Co., Scribner & Co.,
Frank Leslie, A. D. F. Randolph & Co., G. W. Carleton & Co., The
American Tract Society, Robert Carter & Bros., Munn & Co., Pub.

Weekly," and also a large part of the principal publishers and
manufacturers throughout the country.

COPY.

Almost all kinds of Prints or Engravings from Wood, Stone, Copper and
Steel may be reproduced directly. _The requisites are, clean, distinct
black lines or stipple work, on white or only slightly tinted paper.
All Photographs and Pencil Sketches must first be drawn in ink._ We
keep a corps of artists constantly employed, trained to do this work
in the best manner. We can make drawings from photographs or tin-types
taken in the usual way. They may be of any size, but should, of course,
show the object distinctly.

Drawings for our use, unless intended to be redrawn, should be on a
_smooth, white_ surface, in _perfectly black_ lines, and usually twice
the dimensions each way of the desired plate.

Copy for fac-similes of handwriting should be in _perfectly black ink_,
on _smooth white_ paper, written with a full pen, and without use of
blotting paper.

TIME.

While we can engrave a plate in a few hours that would occupy a
wood-engraver a month, and often do so, yet with the large amount of
work constantly on hand and promised, we cannot usually engage to fill
an order for a single plate in less than from three to six days;
larger orders will, of course, require longer time.

CHANGE OF SIZE.

In reproducing wood-cut prints, the size can often be considerably
reduced; but if the reduction is great, the lines become so fine and
close together that they will not print well. Coarse wood-cuts, such
as are generally used in Newspapers, may often be reduced to half
their linear dimensions, but _fine_ wood-cuts will admit of but little
reduction.

_Most_ steel plate prints and lithographs will not admit of any
reduction, and even when reproduced, the same size in relief, require
considerable care in printing.

All kinds of prints generally look bad when much enlarged, as the
lines become very coarse and ragged on the edges; though we have
sometimes made very effective cuts for posters and hand-bills in this
way.

In all cases of enlargement and reduction the relative proportions
remain the same.

It must not be forgotten, however, that by redrawing, prints of any
kind can be enlarged or reduced to any desired size.

PROOFS.

We will, whenever desired, furnish tin-type proofs of drawings made by
us, for examination and approval, or correction, before engraving.

A printed proof is sent with each plate when delivered, which may
always be equaled or surpassed in actual work with proper usage.

PRICES.

It is impossible to give a scale of prices by the square inch for
miscellaneous job-work, as sometimes a small cut two or three inches
square may require as much work as another one a foot square. We can,
however, give an average inch rate to newspaper publishers whose work
runs uniformly about the same from week to week, especially when they
furnish us with copy already prepared--such as prints and pen-and-ink
drawings.
