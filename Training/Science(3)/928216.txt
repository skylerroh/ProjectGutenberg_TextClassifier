performed very gently and carefully, as otherwise oxygen will rush in so
rapidly as to cause excessive tension. As the bag fills with gas, the
index on the petroleum manometer moves along the arc of a circle and
gradually reaches the desired point. At this point, the supply of oxygen
is cut off, the valve connecting the tension-equalizer with the main
system is opened, and simultaneously the needle-valve on the
reduction-valve of the oxygen cylinder is tightly closed, preliminary to
weighing the cylinder. At this point the motor can be started and the
experiment continued.

It is necessary, then, that the oxygen cylinder be weighed. This is done
after first closing the pet-cock on the end of the pipe conducting the
gas beneath the floor of the calorimeter room, slipping the glass joint
in the rubber pipe leading from the reduction valve to the pet-cock, and
breaking the connections between the two rubber pipes, the one from the
pet-cock and the other to the reduction valve, also breaking the
electrical connection leading to the magnet on the cylinder. The
cylinder is then ready to swing freely without any connections to either
oxygen pipe or electrical wires. It is then weighed, the loss in weight
being noted by removing the brass weights on the shelf attached to the
counterpoise. It is important to see that there is a sufficient number
of brass weights always on the shelf to allow for a maximum loss of
weight of oxygen from the cylinder during a given period. Since the
cylinders contain not far from 4 to 5 kilograms of oxygen, in balancing
the cylinders at the start it is customary to place at least 4 kilograms
of brass weights on the shelf and then adjust the counterpoise so as to
allow for the gradual removal of these weights as the oxygen is
withdrawn.

As soon after the beginning of the period as possible, the U-tubes are
weighed on the analytical balance, and if they have not gained too much
they are connected ready for the next analysis. If they have already
absorbed too much water or carbon dioxide, they are replaced by freshly
filled tubes.

Immediately at the end of the experimental period the barometer is
carefully set and read, and the reading is verified by another
assistant. Throughout the whole experiment an assistant counts the pulse
of the subject frequently, by means of the stethoscope, and records the
respiration rate by noting the lesser fluctuations of the tambour
pointer on the smoked paper. These observations are recorded every few
minutes in a book kept especially for this purpose.

A most excellent preservation of the record of the minor muscular
movements is obtained by dipping the smoked paper on the kymograph drum
in a solution of resin and alcohol. The lesser movements on the paper
indicate the respiration rate, but every minor muscular movement, such
as moving the arm or shifting the body in any way, is shown by a large
deflection of the pointer out of the regular zone of vibration. These
records of the minor muscular activity are of great importance in
interpreting the results of the chemical and physical determinations.

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
