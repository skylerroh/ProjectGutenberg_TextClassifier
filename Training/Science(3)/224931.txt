No attempts have been made to determine the proportion of nitric acid in
air, but its quantity is undoubtedly excessively minute, and materially
smaller than that of ammonia. At least this conclusion seems to be a
fair inference from Way's researches, as well as the recent experiments
of Boussingault on the proportion of nitric acid contained in rain, dew,
and fog, made in a manner exactly similar to those on the ammonia,
already quoted. According to his experiments an imperial gallon
contains--

      {Liebfrauenberg    0.0718

Although it thus appears that Barral's results have been only partially
confirmed, enough has been ascertained to show that the quantity of
ammonia and nitric acid in the air is sufficient to produce a material
influence in the growth of plants. The large amount of these substances
contained in the dew is also particularly worthy of notice, and may
serve to some extent to explain its remarkably invigorating effect on
vegetation.

_Carburetted Hydrogen._--Gay-Lussac, Humboldt, and Boussingault have
shown, that when the whole of the moisture and carbonic acid have been
removed from the air, it still contains a small quantity of carbon and
hydrogen; and Saussure has rendered it probable that they exist in a
state of combination as carburetted hydrogen gas. No definite proof of
this position has, however, as yet been adduced, and the function of the
compound is entirely unknown. It is possible that the presence of carbon
and hydrogen may be due to a small quantity of organic matter; but,
whatever be its source, its amount is certainly extremely small.

_Sulphuretted Hydrogen and Phosphuretted Hydrogen._--The proportion of
these substances is almost infinitesimal; but they are pretty general
constituents of the atmosphere, and are apparently derived from the
decomposition of animal and vegetable matters.

The preceding statements lead to the important conclusion, that the
atmosphere is capable of affording an abundant supply of all the organic
elements of plants, because it not only contains nitrogen and oxygen in
the free state, but also in those forms of combination in which they are
most readily absorbed, as well as a large quantity of carbonic acid,
from which their carbon may be derived. At first sight it may indeed
appear that the quantity of the latter compound, and still more that of
ammonia, is so trifling as to be of little practical importance. But a
very simple calculation serves to show that, though relatively small,
they are absolutely large, for the carbonic acid contained in the whole
atmosphere amounts in round numbers to

     2,400,000,000,000 tons,

and the ammonia, assuming it not to exceed one part in fifty millions,
must weigh

     74,000,000 tons,

quantities amply sufficient to afford an abundant supply of these
elements to the whole vegetation of our globe.

_The Soil as a Source of the Organic Constituents of Plants._--When a
portion of soil is subjected to heat, it is found that it, like the
plant, consists of a combustible and an incombustible part; but while in
the plant the incombustible part or ash is small, and the combustible
large, these proportions are reversed in the soil, which consists
chiefly of inorganic or mineral matters, mixed with a quantity of
combustible or organic substances, rarely exceeding 8 or 10 per cent,
and often falling considerably short of this quantity.

The organic matter exists in the form of a substance called humus, which
must be considered here as a source of the organic constituents of
plants, independently of the general composition of the soil, which will
be afterwards discussed.

The term _humus_ is generic, and applied by chemists to a rather
numerous group of substances, very closely allied in their properties,
several of which are generally present in all fertile soils. They have
been submitted to examination by various chemists, but by none more
accurately than by Mulder and Herman, to whom, indeed, we owe almost all
the precise information we possess on the subject. The organic matters
of the soil may be divided into three great classes; the first
containing those substances which are soluble in water; the second,
those extracted by means of caustic potash; and the third, those
insoluble in all menstrua. When a soil is boiled with a solution of
caustic potash, a deep brown fluid is obtained, from which acids
precipitate a dark brown flocculent substance, consisting of a mixture
of at least three different acids, to which the names of humic, ulmic,
and geic acids have been applied. The fluid from which they have been
precipitated contains two substances, crenic and apocrenic acids, while
the soil still retains what has been called insoluble humus.

The acids above named do not differ greatly in chemical characters, but
they have been subdivided into the humic, geic, and crenic groups, which
present some differences in properties and composition. They are
compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and are characterised by so
powerful an affinity for ammonia that they are with difficulty obtained
free from that substance, and generally exist in the soil in combination
with it. They are all products of the decomposition of vegetable
matters in the soil, and are formed during their decay by a succession
of changes, which may be easily traced by observing the course of events
when a piece of wood or any other vegetable substance is exposed for a
length of time to air and moisture. It is then found gradually to
disintegrate with the evolution of carbonic acid, acquiring first a
brown and finally a black colour. At one particular stage of the process
it is converted into one or other of two substances, called humin and
ulmin, both insoluble in alkalies, and apparently identical with the
insoluble humus of the soil; but when the decomposition is more advanced
the products become soluble in alkalies, and then contain humic, ulmic,
and geic acids, and finally, by a still further progress, crenic and
apocrenic acids are formed as the result of an oxidation occurring at
certain periods of the decay.

The roots and other vegetable debris remaining in the soil undergo a
similar series of changes, and form the humus, which is found only in
the surface soil, that is to say, in the portion which is now or has at
some previous period been occupied by plants, and the quantity of humus
contained in any soil is mainly dependent on the activity of vegetation
on it. Numerous analyses of humus compounds extracted from the soil have
been made, and have served to establish a number of minor differences in
the composition even of those to which the same name has been applied,
due manifestly to the fact that their production is the result of a
gradual decomposition, which renders it impossible to extract from the
soil one pure substance, but only a variable mixture of several, so
similar to one another in properties, that their separation is very
difficult, if not impossible. For this reason great discrepancies exist
in the statements made regarding them by different observers, but this
is a matter of comparatively small importance, as their exact
composition has no very direct bearing on agricultural questions, and it
will suffice to give the names and chemical formulae of those which have
been analysed and described,--

Ulmic acid from long Frisian turf    C_{40}  H_{18}  O_{16}
Humic acid from hard turf            C_{40}  H_{15}  O_{15}
Humic acid from arable soil          C_{40}  H_{16}  O_{16}
Humic acid from a pasture field      C_{40}  H_{14}  O_{14}
Geic acid                            C_{40}  H_{15}  O_{17}
Apocrenic acid                       C_{48}  H_{12}  O_{24}
Crenic acid                          C_{24}  H_{12}  O_{16}

It is only necessary to observe further, that these formulae indicate a
close connection with woody fibre, and the continuous diminution of the
hydrogen and increase of oxygen shows that they must have been produced
by a gradually advancing decay.

The earlier chemists and vegetable physiologists attributed to the humus
of the soil a much more important function than it is now believed to
possess.

It was formerly considered to be the exclusive, or at least the chief
source of the organic constituents of plants, and by absorption through
the roots to yield to them the greater part of their nutriment. But
though this view has still some supporters, among whom Mulder is the
most distinguished, it is now generally admitted that humus is not a
_direct_ source of the organic constituents of plants, and is not
absorbed as such by their roots, although it is so _indirectly_, in as
far as the decomposition which it is constantly undergoing in the soil
yields carbonic acid, which can be absorbed. The older opinion is
refuted by many well-ascertained facts. As regards the exclusive origin
of the carbon of plants from humus, it is easy to see that this at least
cannot be true, for humus, as already stated, is itself derived solely
from the decomposition of vegetable and animal matters; and if the
plants on the earth's surface were to be supported by it alone, the
whole of their substance would have to return to the soil in the same
form, in order to supply the generation which succeeds them. But this is
very far from being the case, for the respiration of animals, the
combustion of fuel, and many other processes, are annually converting a
large quantity of these matters into carbonic acid; and if there were no
other source of carbon but the humus of the soil, the amount of
vegetable life would gradually diminish, and at length become entirely
extinct. Schleiden, who has discussed this subject very fully, has made
an approximative calculation of the total quantity of humus on the
earth's surface, and of the carbon annually converted into carbonic acid
by the respiration of man and animals, the combustion of wood for fuel,
and other minor processes; and he draws the conclusion that, if there
were no other source of carbon except humus, the quantity of that
substance existing in the soil would only support vegetation for a
period of sixty years.

The particular phenomena of vegetation also afford abundant evidence
that humus cannot be the only source of carbon. Thus Boussingault has
shown that on the average of years, the crops cultivated on an acre of
land remove from it about one ton more organic matter than they receive
in the manure applied to them, although there is no corresponding
diminution in the quantity of humus contained in the soil. An instance
which leads still more unequivocally to the same conclusion is given by
Humboldt. He states that an acre of land, planted with bananas, yields
annually about 152,000 pounds weight of fruit, containing about 32,000
pounds, or almost exactly 14 tons of carbon; and as this production goes
on during a period of twenty years, there must be withdrawn in that time
no less than 280 tons of carbon. But the soil on an acre of land weighs,
in round numbers, 1000 tons, and supposing it to contain 4 per cent of
humus, the total weight of carbon in it would amount to little more than
20 tons.

It is obvious from these and many other analogous facts that humus
cannot be the only or even a considerable source of the carbon of
plants, although it is still contended by some chemists that it may be
absorbed to a small extent. But even this is at variance with many
well-known facts. For if humus were absorbed, it might be expected that
vegetation would be most luxuriant on soils containing abundance of that
substance, especially if it existed in a soluble and readily absorbable
form; but so far from this being the case, nothing is more certain than
that peat, in which these conditions are fulfilled, is positively
injurious to most plants. On the other hand, our daily experience
affords innumerable examples of plants growing luxuriantly in soils and
places where no humus exists. The sands of the sea-shore, and the most
barren rocks, have their vegetation, and the red-hot ashes which are
thrown out by active volcanoes are no sooner cool than a crop of plants
springs up on them.

The conclusions to be drawn from these considerations have been further
confirmed by the direct experiments of different observers. Boussingault
sowed peas, weighing 15.60 grains, in a soil composed of a mixture of
sand and clay, which had been heated red-hot, and consequently contained
no humus, and after 99 days' growth, during which they had been watered
with distilled water, he found the crop to weigh 68.72 grains, so that
there had been a fourfold increase. Similar experiments have been made
by Prince Salm Horstmar, on oats and rape sown in a soil deprived of
organic matter by ignition, in which they grew readily, and arrived at
complete maturity. One oat straw attained a height of three feet, and
bore 78 grains; another bore 47; and a third 28--in all 153. These when
dried at 212 deg. weighed 46.302 grains, and the straw 45.6 grains. The most
satisfactory experiments, however, are those of Weigman and Polstorf,
these observers having found that it was possible to obtain a
two-hundred-fold produce of barley in an entirely artificial soil,
provided care was taken to give it the _physical_ characters of a
fertile soil. They prepared a mixture of six parts of sand, two of
chalk, one of white bole, and one of wood charcoal; to which was added a
small quantity of felspar, previously fused with marble and some soluble
salts, so as to imitate as closely as possible the inorganic parts of a
soil, and in it they planted twelve barley pickles. The plants grew
luxuriantly, reaching a height of three feet, and each bearing nine
ears, containing 22 pickles. The grain of the twelve plants weighed 2040
grains.

These experiments show that plants can grow and produce seed when the
most scrupulous care is taken to deprive them of every trace of humus.
But Saussure has gone further, and shown that even when present, humus
is not absorbed. He allowed plants of the common bean and the Polygonum
Persicaria to grow in solutions of humate of potash, and found a very
trifling diminution in the quantity of humic acid present; but the value
of his experiments is invalidated by his having omitted to ascertain
whether the diminution of humic acid which he observed was really due
to absorption by the plant. This omission has been supplied by Weigman
and Polstorf. They grew plants of mint (Mentha undulata) and of
Polygonum Persicaria in solutions of humate of potash, and placed beside
the glass containing the plant, another perfectly similar, and
containing only the solution of humate of potash. The solution, which
contained in every 100 grains, 0.148 grains of solid matter, consisting
of humate of potash, etc. was found to become gradually paler, and at
the end of a month, during which time the plants had increased by 6-1/2
inches, the quantity of solid matter in 100 grains had diminished to
0.132. But the solution contained in the other glass, and in which no
plant had grown, had diminished to 0.136, so that the absorption could
not have amounted to more than 0.004 grains for every 100 grains of
solution employed. This quantity is so small as to be within the limits
of error of experiment, and we are consequently entitled to draw the
conclusion that humus, even under the most favourable circumstances, is
not absorbed by plants.

But though not directly capable of affording nutriment to plants, it
must not, on that account, be supposed that humus is altogether devoid
of importance, for it is constantly undergoing decomposition in the
soil, and thus becomes a source of carbonic acid which can be absorbed,
and, as we shall afterwards more particularly see, it exercises very
important functions in bringing the other constituents of the soil into
readily available forms of combination.

It has been already observed that carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and
oxygen, cannot be absorbed by plants when uncombined, but only in the
forms of water, carbonic acid, ammonia, and nitric acid. It is scarcely
necessary to detail the grounds on which this conclusion has been
arrived at in regard to carbon and hydrogen, for practically it is of
little importance whether they can be absorbed or not, as the former is
rarely, the latter never, found uncombined in nature. Neither can there
be any doubt that water and carbonic acid are the only substances from
which these elements can be obtained. Every-day experience convinces us
that water is essential to vegetation; and Saussure, and other
observers, have shown that plants will not grow if they are deprived of
carbonic acid, and that they actually absorb that substance abundantly
from the atmosphere. The evidence for the non-absorption of oxygen lies
chiefly in the fact that plants obtain, in the form of water and
carbonic acid, a larger quantity of that element than they require, and
in place of absorbing, are constantly exhaling it. The form in which
nitrogen may be absorbed has given rise to much difference of opinion.
In the year 1779, Priestley commenced the examination of this subject,
and drew from his experiments the conclusion, that plants absorb the
nitrogen of the air. Saussure shortly afterwards examined the same
subject, and having found, that when grown in a confined space of air,
and watered with pure water, the nitrogen of the plants underwent no
increase, he inferred that they derived their entire supplies of that
element from ammonia, or the soluble nitrogenous constituents of the
soil or manure. Boussingault has since re-examined this question, and by
a most elaborate series of experiments, in which the utmost care was
taken to avoid every source of fallacy, he was led to the conclusion,
that when haricots, oats, lupins, and cresses were grown in calcined
pumice-stone, mixed with the ash of plants, and supplied with air
deprived of ammonia and nitric acid, their nitrogen underwent no
increase. It has been objected to these experiments, that the plants
being confined in a limited bulk of air, were placed in an unnatural
condition, and Ville has recently repeated them with a current of air
passing through the apparatus, and found a slight increase in the
nitrogen, due, as he thinks, to direct absorption. It is much more
probable, however, that it depends on small quantities of ammonia or
nitric acid which had not been completely removed from the air by the
means employed for that purpose, for nothing is more difficult than the
complete abstraction of these substances, and as the gain of nitrogen
was only 0.8 grains, while 60,000 gallons of air, and 13 of water, were
employed in the experiment, which lasted for a considerable time, it is
reasonable to suppose that a sufficient quantity may have remained to
produce this trifling increase.

While these experiments show that plants maintain only a languid
existence when grown in air deprived of ammonia and nitric acid, and
hence, that the direct absorption of nitrogen, if it occur at all, must
do so to a very small extent, the addition of a very minute quantity of
the former substance immediately produces an active vegetation and rapid
increase in size of the plants. Among the most striking proofs of this
are the experiments of Wolff, made by growing barley and vetches in a
soil calcined so as to destroy organic matters, and then mixed with
small quantities of different compounds of ammonia. He found that when
the produce from the calcined soil was represented by 100, that from the
different ammoniacal salts was--

                        Barley.     Vetches.

Muriate of Ammonia       257.2      176.4
Carbonate of Ammonia     123.6      173.8
Sulphate of Ammonia      203.6      125.2

These experiments not only prove that ammonia can be absorbed, but they
also indirectly confirm the statement already made, that humus is not
necessary; for in some instances the produce was higher than that
obtained from the uncalcined soil with the same manures, although it
contained four per cent of humus.

On such experiments Liebig rests his opinion that ammonia is the
exclusive source of the nitrogen of plants, and although he has recently
admitted that it may be replaced by nitric acid, it is obvious that he
considers this a rare and exceptional occurrence. The evidence, however,
for the absorption of nitric acid appears to rest on as good grounds as
that of ammonia, for experience has shown that nitrate of soda acts
powerfully as a manure, and its effect must be due to the nitric acid,
and not to the soda, for the other compounds of that alkali have no such
effect. Wolff has illustrated this point by a series of experiments on
the sunflower, of which we shall quote one. He took two seeds of that
plant, and sowed them on the 10th May, in a soil composed of calcined
sand, mixed with a small quantity of the ash of plants, and added at
intervals during the progress of the experiment, a quantity of nitrate
of potash, amounting in all to 17.13 grains. The plants were watered
with distilled water, containing carbonic acid in solution, and the pot
in which they grew was protected from rain and dew by a glass cover. On
the 19th August one of the plants had attained a height of above 28
inches, and had nine fine leaves and a flower-bud; the other was about
20 inches high, and had ten leaves. On the 22d August, one of the plants
having been accidentally injured, the experiment was terminated. The
plants, which contained 103.16 grains of dry matter, were then carefully
analysed, and the quantity of nitrogen contained in the soil after the
experiment and in the seed was determined.
