consists of 55 plates, each embracing more than 900 square degrees of
the sky. The photographs were taken with a small lens of only 2.5 cms.
aperture and about 32.5 cms. focal-length. The time of exposure was one
hour. These plates have been counted at the Lund Observatory by Hans
HENIE. We return later to these counts.

The _FRANKLIN-ADAMS Charts_ were made by an amateur astronomer
FRANKLIN-ADAMS, partly at his own observatory (Mervel Hill) in England,
partly in Cape and Johannesburg, Transvaal, in the years 1905-1912. The
photographs were taken with a _Taylor_ lens with 25 cm. aperture and a
focal-length of 114 cm., which gives rather good images on a field of 15
x 15 square degrees.

The whole sky is here reproduced on, in all, 206 plates. Each plate was
exposed for 2 hours and 20 minutes and gives images of the stars down to
the 17th magnitude. The original plates are now at the observatory in
Greenwich. Some copies on paper have been made, of which the Lund
Observatory possesses one. It shows stars down to the 14th-15th
magnitudes and gives a splendid survey of the whole sky more complete,
indeed, than can be obtained, even for the north sky, by direct
observation of the heavens with any telescope at present accessible in
Sweden.

The F. A. C. have been counted by the astronomers of the Lund
Observatory, so that thus a complete count of the number of stars for
the whole heaven down to the 14th magnitude has been obtained. We shall
later have an opportunity of discussing the results of these counts.

A great star map is planned in connection with the Paris catalogue
mentioned in the preceding paragraph. This _Carte du Ciel_ (C. d. C.) is
still unfinished, but there seems to be a possibility that we shall one
day see this work carried to completion. It will embrace stars down to
the 14th magnitude and thus does not reach so far as the F. A. C., but
on the other hand is carried out on a considerably greater scale and
gives better images than F. A. C. and will therefore be of a great value
in the future, especially for the study of the proper motions of the
stars.


22. _Distance of the stars._ As the determination, from the annual
parallax, of the distances of the stars is very precarious if the
distance exceeds 5 sir. ([pi] = 0".04), it is only natural that the
catalogues of star-distances should be but few in number. The most
complete catalogues are those of BIGOURDAN in the Bulletin astronomique
XXVI (1909), of KAPTEYN and WEERSMA in the publications of Groningen Nr.
24 (1910), embracing 365 stars, and of WALKEY in the "Journal of the
British Astronomical Association XXVII" (1917), embracing 625 stars.
Through the spectroscopic method of ADAMS it will be possible to enlarge
this number considerably, so that the distance of all stars, for which
the spectrum is well known, may be determined with fair accuracy. ADAMS
has up to now published 1646 parallax stars.


23. _Proper motions._ An excellent catalogue of the proper motions of
the stars is LEWIS BOSS's "Preliminary General Catalogue of 6188 stars"
(1910) (B. P. C.). It contains the proper motions of all stars down to
the sixth magnitude (with few exceptions) and moreover some fainter
stars. The catalogue is considered by the editor only as a preliminary
to a greater catalogue, which is to embrace some 25000 stars and is now
nearly completed.


24. _Visual magnitudes._ The Harvard observatory has, under the
direction of PICKERING, made its principal aim to study the
magnitudes of the stars, and the history of this observatory is at the
same time the history of the treatment of this problem. PICKERING, in
the genuine American manner, is not satisfied with the three thirds of
the sky visible from the Harvard observatory, but has also founded a
daughter observatory in South America, at Arequipa in Peru. It is
therefore possible for him to publish catalogues embracing the whole
heaven from pole to pole. The last complete catalogue (1908) of the
magnitudes of the stars is found in the "Annals of the Harvard
Observatory T. 50" (H. 50). It contains 9110 stars and can be considered
as complete to the magnitude 6m.5. To this catalogue are generally
referred the magnitudes which have been adopted at the Observatory of
Lund, and which are treated in these lectures.

A very important, and in one respect even still more comprehensive,
catalogue of visual magnitudes is the "Potsdam General Catalogue" (P. G.
C.) by MUeLLER and KEMPF, which was published simultaneously with H. 50.
It contains the magnitude of 14199 stars and embraces all stars on the
northern hemisphere brighter than 7m.5 (according to B. D.). We have
already seen that the zero-point of H. 50 and P. G. C. is somewhat
different and that the magnitudes in P. G. C. must be increased by
-0m.16 if they are to be reduced to the Harvard scale. The difference
between the two catalogues however is due to some extent to the colour
of the stars, as has been shown by Messrs. MUeLLER and KEMPF.


25. _Photographic magnitudes._ Our knowledge of this subject is still
rather incomplete. The most comprehensive catalogue is the
"Actinometrie" by SCHWARZSCHILD (1912), containing the photographic
magnitudes of all stars in B. D. down to the magnitude 7m.5 between the
equator and a declination of +20 deg.. In all, 3522 stars. The photographic
magnitudes are however not reduced for the zero-point (compare Sec.6).

These is also a photometric photographic catalogue of the stars nearest
to the pole in PARKHURST's "Yerkes actinometry" (1912),[11] which
contains all stars in B. D. brighter than 7m.5 between the pole and 73 deg.
northern declination. The total number of stars is 672.

During the last few years the astronomers of Harvard and Mount Wilson
have produced a collection of "standard photographic magnitudes" for
faint stars. These stars, which are called the _polar sequence_,[12] all
lie in the immediate neighbourhood of the pole. The list is extended
down to the 20th magnitude. Moreover similar standard photographic
magnitudes are given in H. A. 71, 85 and 101.

A discussion of the _colour-index_ (_i.e._, the difference between the
photographic and the visual magnitudes) will be found in L. M. II, 19.
When the visual magnitude and the type of spectrum are known, the
photographic magnitude may be obtained, with a generally sufficient
accuracy, by adding the colour-index according to the table 1 in Sec.15
above.


26. _Stellar spectra._ Here too we find the Harvard Observatory to be
the leading one. The same volume of the Annals of the Harvard
Observatory (H. 50) that contains the most complete catalogue of visual
magnitudes, also gives the spectral types for all the stars there
included, _i.e._, for all stars to 6m.5. Miss CANNON, at the Harvard
Observatory, deserves the principal credit for this great work. Not
content with this result she is now publishing a still greater work
embracing more than 200000 stars. The first four volumes of this work
are now published and contain the first twelve hours of right
ascension, so that half the work is now printed.[13]


27. _Radial velocity._ In this matter, again, we find America to be the
leading nation, though, this time, it is not the Harvard or the Mount
Wilson but the Lick Observatory to which we have to give the honour. The
eminent director of this observatory, W. W. CAMPBELL, has in a high
degree developed the accuracy in the determination of radial velocities
and has moreover carried out such determinations in a large scale. The
"Bulletin" No. 229 (1913) of the Lick Observatory contains the radial
velocity of 915 stars. At the observatory of Lund, where as far as
possible card catalogues of the attributes of the stars are collected,
GYLLENBERG has made a catalogue of this kind for the radial velocities.
The total number of stars in this catalogue now amounts to 1640.[14]


28. Finally I shall briefly mention some comprehensive works on more
special questions regarding the stellar system.

On _variable stars_ there is published every year by HARTWIG in the
"Vierteljahrschrift der astronomischen Gesellschaft" a catalogue of all
known variable stars with needful information about their minima &c.
This is the completest and most reliable of such catalogues, and is
always up to date. A complete historical catalogue of the variables is
given in "Geschichte und Literatur des Lichtwechsels der bis Ende 1915
als sicher veraenderlich anerkannten Sterne nebst einem Katalog der
Elemente ihres Lichtwechsels" von G. MUeLLER und E. HARTWIG. Leipzig
1918, 1920.

On _nebulae_ we have the excellent catalogues of DREYER, the "New
General Catalogue" (N. G. C.) of 1890 in the "Memoirs of the
Astronomical Society" vol. 49, the "Index catalogues" (I. C.) in the
same memoirs, vols. 51 and 59 (1895 and 1908). These catalogues contain
all together 13226 objects.

Regarding other special attributes I refer in the first place to the
important Annals of the Harvard Observatory. Other references will be
given in the following, as need arises.

CHAPTER III.

SOME GROUPS OF KNOWN STARS.


29. The number of cases in which all the eight attributes of the stars
discussed in the first chapter are well known for one star is very
small, and certainly does not exceed one hundred. These cases refer
principally to such stars as are characterized either by great
brilliancy or by a great proper motion. The principal reason why these
stars are better known than others is that they lie rather near our
solar system. Before passing on to consider the stars from more general
statistical points of view, it may therefore be of interest first to
make ourselves familiar with these well-known stars, strongly
emphasizing, however, the exceptional character of these stars, and
carefully avoiding any generalization from the attributes we shall here
find.


30. _The apparently brightest stars._ We begin with these objects so
well known to every lover of the stellar sky. The following table
contains all stars the apparent visual magnitude of which is brighter
than 1m.5.

The first column gives the current number, the second the name, the
third the equatorial designation ([alpha][delta]). It should be
remembered that the first four figures give the hour and minutes in
right ascension, the last two the declination, italics showing negative
declination. The fourth column gives the galactic square, the fifth and
sixth columns the galactic longitude and latitude. The seventh and
eighth columns give the annual parallax and the corresponding distance
expressed in siriometers. The ninth column gives the proper motion
([mu]), the tenth the radial velocity _W_ expressed in sir./st. (To get
km./sec. we may multiply by 4.7375). The eleventh column gives the
apparent visual magnitude, the twelfth column the absolute magnitude
(_M_), computed from _m_ with the help of _r_. The 13th column gives the
type of spectrum (_Sp_), and the last column the photographic magnitude
(_m'_). The difference between _m'_ and _m_ gives the colour-index
(_c_).
