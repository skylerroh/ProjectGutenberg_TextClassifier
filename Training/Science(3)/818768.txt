Sather Karf told him. "It's your world, literally, so take your time.
What do you want first?"

Hanson considered it, while Nema's hand crept into his. Then he grinned.
"I guess I want to get your great granddaughter turned into a registered
and certified wife and take her on a long honeymoon," he decided. "After
what you've put me through, I need a rest."

He took her arm and started down the aisle of the council room. Behind
him, he heard Bork's chuckle and the soft laughter of Sather Karf. But
their faces were sobering by the time he reached the doorway and looked
back.

"I like him, too, grandfather," Bork was saying. "Well, it seems your
group was right, after all. Your prophecy is fulfilled. He may have a
little trouble with so many knowing his name, but he's Dave Hanson, to
whom nothing is impossible. You should have considered all the
implications of omnipotence."

Sather Karf nodded. "Perhaps. And perhaps your group was also right,
Bork. It seems that the world-egg has hatched." His eyes lifted and
centered on the doorway.

Hanson puzzled over their words briefly as he closed the door and went
out with Nema. He'd probably have to do something about his name, but
the rest of the conversation was a mystery to him. Then he dismissed
it. He could always remember it when he had more time to think about it.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was many millenia and several universes later when Dave Hanson
finally remembered. By then it was no mystery, of course. And there was
no one who dared pronounce his true name.


THE END.
