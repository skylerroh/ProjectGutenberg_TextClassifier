the additional quantity of nitrogen which it contains from the air, as
appears to be tacitly assumed throughout the whole discussion. So far
from this being the case, it is just as likely that the mineral matters
should cause the plants to take it from the soil, if it is there, as
from the atmosphere.

Taking a general view of the whole question, it is evident that a
certain amount of vegetation may always be produced by means of mineral
manures, and the quantity obtained is generally much beyond the normal
produce of the soil. But it is still open to doubt whether the largest
possible crop can be thus obtained, although the balance of evidence is
against it, and in favour of the addition of ammonia, and other
nitrogenous and organic substances, to the soil. In actual practice
manures containing nitrogen are more important, and more extensively
applied than any others, and the quantity of that element thus used is
very much larger than is generally supposed. Twenty tons of farm-yard
manure, a quantity commonly applied, and often exceeded on well
cultivated land, contain a sufficiency of organic matters to yield about
2-1/2 cwt. of nitrogen. A complete rotation, according to the six-course
shift, contains almost exactly the same quantity of nitrogen, when we
assume average crops throughout the whole, and it is thus made up.[K]

                                     Lbs. of Nitrogen.
1. Turnips (13-1/2 tons)                     60
2. { Wheat (28 bushels at 60 lbs.)           29
   { Straw                                   16
3. Hay (2-1/2 tons)                          56
4. { Oats (34 bushels at 40 lbs.)            27

5. Potatoes (3 tons)                         27
6. Wheat and straw as before                 45
                                           ----
                                    Total   274

The supply is therefore quite sufficient for the requirements of the
crop; and when it is borne in mind that a considerable quantity of
ammonia and nitric acid is annually carried down by the rain, and that
during a long rotation other substances are very generally used in
addition to farm-yard manure, it is obvious that the crop need not
depend to any extent upon what it derives from the air. What is true of
the nitrogenous matters applies with still greater force to the mineral
constituents of the manure. Twenty tons of farm-yard manure contain 32
cwt. of mineral matters, while the average crops of a six course-shift
contain only 1088 lbs., or less than one-third of this quantity. It is
obvious, therefore, that in well manured land there must be a gradual
increase of all the constituents of plants, but that of the mineral
matters is relatively much greater than that of the nitrogenous. If
therefore from any cause the crop produced on a soil to which farm-yard
manure had been applied were greatly to exceed the average, the amount
of produce, so far as the soil is concerned, would be limited not by
deficiency of mineral, but of nitrogenous food. Hence also when
farm-yard manure is liberally applied, there is a gradual accumulation
of valuable matters, and a progressive improvement of the productive
capacity of the soil.

It is far otherwise, however, if a special manure is employed, because
in that case the crop is thrown upon the resources of the soil itself
for all its constituents except those contained in the substance
employed, and by persisting in its exclusive use exhaustion is the
inevitable result. It would be wrong, however, to infer from this, that
special manures are to be avoided. On the contrary, great benefits are
derived from their judicious employment, and the circumstances under
which they are admissible may be readily gathered from what has already
been said. They are agents which bring into useful activity the dormant
resources of the soil, they restore the proper balance between its
different constituents, and supply the excessive demand of some
particular elements. Thus, for instance, in a soil containing an
abundant supply of mineral matters, a salt of ammonia or nitric acid
increases the crop, by promoting the absorption of the substances
already present. So likewise a soil on which young cattle and milch cows
have been long pastured has its fertility restored by phosphate of lime,
because that substance is removed in the bones and milk in relatively
much larger proportion than any others.

The choice of a special manure is necessarily dependent on a great
variety of circumstances, and is governed partly by the nature of the
soil, and partly by that of the crop. It is obvious that cases may occur
in which any individual element of the plant may be deficient, and ought
to be supplied, but experience has shown that, as a rule, nitrogen and
phosphoric acid are the substances which it is most necessary to furnish
in this way, and which in all but exceptional cases produce a marked
effect on the crop. The other substances, such as potash, soda,
magnesia, etc., occasionally act beneficially, but the results obtained
from them are very uncertain, and frequently entirely negative.

It has been commonly asserted that phosphates are specially adapted to
root crops, and ammonia or nitrates to the cereals, and this statement
is so far true, that the former are used with advantage on the turnip,
while the latter act with great benefit on grain crops and more
especially on oats and barley. The effect of the latter, however, is
more or less apparent in all crops and on all soils, because it promotes
the assimilation of the mineral matters already present. But its
peculiar importance lies in the power which it has of promoting the
rapid development of the young plant, causing it to send its roots out
into the soil, and to spread its leaves into the air, thus enabling it
to take from those two sources, abundance of the useful substances
existing in them. But it ought to be distinctly understood, that the
statement that particular manures are specially suited to particular
crops must be assumed with some reservation, because everything depends
upon the nature of the food contained in the soil. It is well known that
there are many soils in which ammonia acts more favourably on the turnip
than phosphates, and _vice versa_, and the difference is often due to
the previous treatment. In many cases in which ammonia when first used
proved most beneficial, it now begins to lose its effect, and the reason
no doubt is, that by its means the phosphates existing in these soils
have been reduced in amount, while the ammonia has accumulated, so that
a change in the system of manuring becomes necessary. A general manure
may be used year after year in a perfectly routine manner, but where a
special manure is employed, the importance of watching its effects, and
altering it as circumstances indicate, cannot be over-estimated. The
length of time during which special manures have been extensively used
has not been sufficient to bring this prominently before the
agriculturist, but its importance must sooner or later force itself upon
him, and he will then see the necessity for studying the succession of
manures as well as that of crops.

Hitherto we have considered a manure merely as a source from which
plants derive their food, but it exercises a scarcely less important
action on the chemical and physical properties of the soil. Farm-yard
manure, which, as we shall afterwards see, contains a large amount of
decomposing vegetable and animal matters, yields a supply of carbonic
acid, which operates on the mineral constituents, promotes their further
disintegration, and thus liberates their useful elements. It affects
also their physical properties, for it diminishes the tenacity of heavy
clays; each straw as it decomposes forming a channel through which the
roots of plants, air, and moisture can penetrate more readily than
through the stiff clay itself. On the other hand, it diminishes the
porosity of light sandy soils, causes them to retain moisture, and
generally makes their texture more suitable to the plant. Special
manures probably act to some extent chemically on the soil, but the
nature of the changes they produce is as yet imperfectly understood.
Superphosphates which are highly acid in all probability act powerfully
on the mineral substances, and common salt, which, though of little
importance to the plant, occasionally produces very striking effects,
appears to exercise some decomposing action on the soil. It is
difficult, however, to trace the mode in which they operate on a
substance of such complexity as the soil. Lime, as we shall afterwards
see, acts by promoting the decomposition of the vegetable matters on
the soil, and possibly some other substances may have a similar effect.

In the application of manures to the soil there are several
circumstances which must be taken into consideration. It is generally
stated that they ought to be distributed as uniformly as possible, but
this is not always necessary nor even advisable, and certainly is not
acted on in practice. Much must depend upon the nature both of crop and
soil. When the former throws out long and widely penetrating roots, the
more uniformly the manure is distributed the better; but if the rootlets
are short, it is clearly more advisable that it should be deposited at
no great distance from the seed. Practically this is observed in the
case of the potato and turnip, which are short rooted, and where the
manure is generally deposited close to the seed. But this course is
never adopted with the long rooted cereals, the manure being usually
applied to the previous crop, so that the repeated ploughings to which
the soil is subjected in the interval may distribute what remains as
widely and uniformly as possible. In soils which are either excessively
tenacious or light, the accumulation of the manure close to the plants
has also the effect of producing an artificial soil in their immediate
neighbourhood, containing abundance of plant-food, and having physical
properties better fitted for the support of the plant. On the other
hand, when a special manure is used alone, and with the view of
promoting the assimilation of substances already existing in the soil,
the more uniform its distribution the better, because it is essential
that the roots which penetrate through it should find at every point
they reach not only the original soil constituents, but also the
substances used to supplement their deficiencies.

CHAPTER VIII.

THE COMPOSITION AND PROPERTIES OF FARM-YARD AND LIQUID MANURES.


In the preceding chapter, a general manure has been defined as one
containing all the constituents of the crop to which it is to be
applied, in a state fitted for assimilation. This condition is fulfilled
only by substances derived from the vegetable and animal kingdoms, and
most effectually by a mixture of both. On this account, and also because
its properties are such as enable it to act powerfully on the soil,
farm-yard manure must always be of the highest importance. It is, in
fact, the typical manure, and in proportion as other substances approach
it in properties and composition, is their value for general purposes on
the farm.

Farm-yard manure is a mixture of the dung and urine of domestic animals,
with the straw used as litter; and its value and composition must
necessarily depend upon that of these substances, as well as on the
proportion in which they are mixed. The dung of animals consists of that
part of their food which passes through the intestinal canal without
undergoing assimilation; the urine containing the portion which has been
assimilated and is again excreted, in consequence of the changes which
are proceeding in the tissues of the animal. Their composition is
naturally very different, and must be separately considered.

_Urine._--Urine consists of a variety of earthy and alkaline salts, and
of certain organic substances, generally rich in nitrogen, dissolved in
a large quantity of water. That of the different domestic animals has
been frequently examined, but the analyses of Fromberg give the most
complete view of their manurial value:--

Human urine has been accurately examined by Berzelius, although his
estimate of the proportion of urea is generally admitted to be above the
average. His analysis gives the following numbers:--

Among the special organic constituents of the urine are three
substances, urea, uric acid, and hippuric acid, which are of much
importance in a manurial point of view. The first of these is found in
considerable quantity in the urine of all animals, but is especially
abundant in the carnivora. Uric acid is found only in these animals, and
is the most remarkable constituent of the excrement of birds, serpents,
and many of the lower animals. Hippuric acid is most abundant in the
herbivora. These substances are all highly nitrogenous. They contain--

                Urea.    Uric Acid.   Hippuric Acid.
Carbon          20.00        36.0        60.7

Oxygen          26.70        28.2        26.3

They are extremely prone to change, and in presence of animal matters
readily ferment, and are converted into salts of ammonia. Thus human
urine, which, at the time of emission is free from smell of ammonia, and
has a slightly acid reaction, becomes highly ammoniacal if it be kept
for a few days. This is due to the conversion of urea into carbonate of
ammonia; and the same change takes place, though more slowly, with uric
and hippuric acids.

It is obvious, from the foregoing analyses, that great differences must
exist in the manurial value of the urine of different animals. Not only
do they vary greatly in the proportion of solid matters which they
contain, but also in the kind and quantity of their nitrogenous
constituents. They differ also in regard to their saline ingredients;
and while salts of potash and soda form the principal part of the ash of
the urine of the ox, sheep, goat, and horse, and phosphoric acid and
phosphates are entirely absent, that of the pig contains a considerable
quantity of the latter substances, and in this respect more nearly
resembles the urine of man. Human urine is also much richer in urea and
nitrogenous constituents generally, and has a higher value than any of
the others.

It is especially worthy of notice that the urine of the purely
herbivorous animals (with the exception of the sheep, which contains a
small quantity), are devoid of phosphates and urea; and consequently,
when employed alone, they are not general manures--a matter of some
importance in relation to the subject of liquid manuring, which will be
afterwards discussed.

_Dung._--The solid excrement of animals is equally variable in
composition. That of the domestic animals which had the ordinary winter
food was found to have the following composition:--

                                Horse.  Cow.  Sheep.  Swine.

Human faeces contain about 75 per cent of water; and their dry residue
was found by Way to have the following composition:--

Insoluble siliceous matters                1.48

In a sample analyzed by myself there were found--

It is to be observed that the urine and dung of animals differ
conspicuously in the composition of their ash, the former being
characterized by the abundance of alkaline salts, while the latter
contains these substances in small proportion, but is rich in earthy
matters, and especially in phosphoric acid. Salts of potash, for
example, form nine-tenths of the inorganic part of the urine of the ox,
while less than three per cent of that alkali is found in its dung.
Phosphoric acid, on the other hand, is not met with in the urine, but
forms about ten per cent of the dung. Silica is the most abundant
constituent of the dung, but a large proportion of that found on
analysis has been swallowed in the shape of grains of sand and particles
of soil mechanically mixed with the food, although part is also derived
from the straw and grains, which contain that substance in great
abundance. The difference in the quantity of nitrogen they contain is
also very marked, and is distinctly shown by the following analyses by
Boussingault, which give the quantity of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen,
oxygen, and ash in the dung and urine of the horse and the cow in their
natural state, and after drying at 212 deg..
