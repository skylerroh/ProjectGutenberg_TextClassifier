
Jeffries brought the car to a halt at a stop light.

"That's about the way I'd heard it," he acknowledged. "What about
negative spotting? Is there a chance there might be an undiscovered
latent left among our recent fellow students?"

"No chance at all," Cavender said. "The process works both ways. If
they aren't, you also know it eventually--and I was sure of everyone
but Greenfield over three weeks ago. She's got as tough a set of
obscuring defenses as I've ever worked against. But after the jolt she
got tonight, she came through clear immediately."

The light changed and the car started up. Jeffries asked, "You feel
both of them can be rehabilitated?"

"Definitely," Cavender said. "Another three months of Grady's
pseudoyoga might have ruined them for good. But give them around a
year to settle out and they'll be all right. Then they'll get the
call. It's been worth the trouble. Jones is good medium grade--and
that Greenfield! She'll be a powerhouse before she's half developed.
Easily the most promising prospect I've come across in six years."

"You're just as certain about Perrie Rochelle?"

"Uh-huh. Protopsi--fairly typical. She's developed as far as she ever
will. It would be a complete waste of time to call her. You can't
train something that just isn't there."

Jeffries grunted. "Never make a mistake, eh?"

Cavender yawned, smiled. "Never have yet, Reuben! Not in that area."

"How did you explain the sandwich to them--and Greenfield's napkin?
They couldn't have bought your stage magic idea."

"No. Told them those were Dr. Al's posthypnotic suggestions. It's the
other standard rationalization."

       *       *       *       *       *

They drove on in silence for a while. Then Jeffries cleared his
throat.

"Incidentally," he said. "I should apologize for the slip with the
sandwich, even though it turned out to our advantage. I can't quite
explain it. I was thinking of other matters at the moment, and I
suppose I...."

Cavender, who had been gazing drowsily through the windshield, shook
his head.

"As you say, it turned out very well, Reuben. Aside from putting the
first crack in Mavis Greenfield's defenses, it shook up Dr. Al to the
point where he decided to collect as much as he could tonight, cash
the checks, and clear out. So he set himself up for the pinch. We
probably gained as much as three or four weeks on both counts."

Jeffries nodded. "I realize that. But...."

"Well, you'd have no reason to blame yourself for the slip in any
case," Cavender went on. "The fact is I'd been so confoundedly busy
all afternoon and evening, I forgot to take time out for dinner. When
that sandwich was being described in those mouth-watering terms, I
realized I was really ravenous. At the same time I was fighting off
sleep. Between the two, I went completely off guard for a moment, and
it simply happened!"

He grinned. "As described, by the way, it was a terrific sandwich.
That group had real imagination!" He hesitated, then put out his hand,
palm up, before him. "As a matter of fact, just talking about it again
seems to be putting me in a mood for seconds...."

Something shimmered for an instant in the dim air wrapped in its green
tissue napkin, a second ham sandwich appeared.
