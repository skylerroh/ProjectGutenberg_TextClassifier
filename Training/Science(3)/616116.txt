    made its appearance in large numbers in other parts of the country.

Value for planting: It is difficult to transplant, grows slowly and is
    seldom found in nurseries.

[Illustration: FIG. 67.--Bud of the Shagbark Hickory.]

Commercial value: The wood is extremely tough and hard and is used for
    agricultural implements and for the manufacture of wagons. It is
    excellent for fuel and the nuts are of great value as a food.

Other characters: The fruit is a nut covered by a thick husk that
    separates into 4 or 5 segments. The kernel is sweet.

Other common names: _Shellbark hickory_.


MOCKERNUT HICKORY (_Hicoria alba_)

[Illustration: FIG. 68.--Bark of the Shagbark Hickory.]

Distinguishing characters: The *bud* is the largest among the
    hickories--nearly half an inch long--is hard and oval and covered
    with _yellowish brown_ downy _scales_ which _do not project_ like
    those of the shagbark hickory, see Fig. 69. The twigs are extremely
    coarse. The *bark* is very tight on the trunk and branches and has a
    _close_, hard, _wavy_ appearance as in Fig. 70.

Leaf: The leaf consists of 5, 7 or 9 leaflets all of which are large and
    pubescent and possess a distinct resinous odor.

Form and size: A tall tree with a broad spreading head.

Range: Eastern North America.

Soil and location: The mockernut hickory grows on a great variety of
    soils, but prefers one which is rich and well-drained.

Enemies: The same as for the shagbark hickory.

Value for planting: It is not commonly planted.

Commercial value: The wood is similar to that of the shagbark hickory
    and is put to the same uses.

Other characters: The fruit is a nut, larger and covered with a shell
    thicker than that of the shagbark. The husk is also thicker and
    separates into four segments nearly to the base. The kernel is small
    and sweet.

Other common names: _Bigbud hickory_; _whiteheart hickory_.

Comparisons: The _pignut hickory_ (_Hicoria glabra_), sometimes called
    broom hickory or brown hickory, often has a shaggy bark, but differs
    from both the shagbark and the mockernut hickory in possessing buds
    very much smaller, twigs more slender and leaflets fewer. The nut
    has a thinner husk which does not separate into four or five
    segments. The tree prefers drier ground than the other hickories.

[Illustration: FIG. 69.--Bud of the Mockernut Hickory.]

    The _bitternut_ (_Hicoria minima_) can be told from the mockernut
    and other species of hickory by its bud, which has no scales at all.
    The color of its bud is a characteristic orange yellow. The bark is
    of a lighter shade than the bark of the mockernut hickory and the
    leaflets are more numerous than in any of the hickories, varying
    from 7 to 11. Its nuts are bitter.


BLACK WALNUT (_Juglans nigra_)

Distinguishing characters: By cutting a twig lengthwise, it will be seen
    that its *pith* is divided into little _chambers_ as shown in Fig.
    71. The bud is dark gray and satiny. The bark is dark brown and
    deeply ridged and the fruit is the familiar round walnut.

[Illustration: FIG. 70.--Bark of the Mockernut Hickory.]

Form and size: A tall tree with a spreading crown composed of stout
    branches. In the open it grows very symmetrically.

Range: Eastern United States.

Soil and location: The black walnut prefers a deep, rich, fertile soil
    and requires a great deal of light.

Enemies: The tree is a favorite of many caterpillars.

Value for planting: It forms a beautiful spreading tree on open ground,
    but is not planted to any extent because it is hard to transplant.
    It grows slowly unless the soil is very deep and rich, develops its
    leaves late in the spring and sheds them early in the fall and
    produces its fruit in great profusion.

Commercial value: The wood is heavy, strong, of chocolate brown color
    and capable of taking a fine polish. It is used for cabinet making
    and interior finish of houses. The older the tree, usually, the
    better the wood, and the consumption of the species in the past has
    been so heavy that it is becoming rare. The European varieties which
    are frequently planted in America as substitutes for the native
    species yield better nuts, but the American species produces better
    wood.

[Illustration: FIG. 71.--Twig of the Black Walnut. Note the large
chambers in the pith.]

[Illustration: FIG. 72.--Twig of the Butternut. Note the small chambers
in the pith.]

Other characters: The _fruit_ is a large round nut about two inches in
    diameter, covered with a smooth husk which at first is dull green
    in color and later turns brown. The husk does not separate into
    sections. The kernel is edible and produces an oil of commercial
    value.

    The _leaves_ are compound and alternate with 15 to 23 leaflets to
    each.

Comparisons: The _butternut_ (_Juglans cinerea_) is another tree that
    has the pith divided into little chambers, but the little chambers
    here are shorter than in the black walnut, as may be seen from a
    comparison of Figs. 71 and 72. The bark of the butternut is light
    gray while that of the black walnut is dark. The buds in the
    butternut are longer than those of the black walnut and are light
    brown instead of gray in color. The form of the tree is low and
    spreading as compared with the black walnut. The fruit in the
    butternut is elongated while that of the black walnut is round. The
    leaves of the butternut have fewer leaflets and these are lighter in
    color.



GROUP X. TULIP TREE, SWEET GUM, LINDEN, MAGNOLIA, LOCUST, CATALPA,
DOGWOOD, MULBERRY AND OSAGE ORANGE


TULIP TREE (_Liriodendron tulipifera_)

Distinguishing characters: There are four characters that stand out
    conspicuously in the tulip tree--the *bud*, the *trunk*, the
    persistent *fruit cups* and the wedged *leaf*.

    The bud, Fig. 74, about three-quarters of an inch long, is covered
    by two purplish scales which lend special significance to its whole
    appearance. The trunk is extremely individual because it rises stout
    and shaft-like, away above the ground without a branch as shown in
    Fig. 73. The tree flowers in the latter part of May but the cup that
    holds the fruit persists throughout the winter. The leaf, Fig. 75,
    has four lobes, is nearly as broad as it is long and so notched at
    the upper end that it looks different from any other leaf.

[Illustration: FIG. 73.--The Tulip Tree.]

[Illustration: FIG. 74.--Bud of the Tulip Tree.]

Form and size: The tulip tree is one of the largest, stateliest and
    tallest of our trees.

Range: Eastern United States.

Soil and location: Requires a deep, moist soil.

Enemies: Comparatively free from insects and disease.

Value for planting: The tree has great value as a specimen on the lawn
    but is undesirable as a street tree because it requires considerable
    moisture and transplants with difficulty. It should be planted while
    young and where it can obtain plenty of light. It grows rapidly.

Commercial value: The wood is commercially known as _whitewood_ and
    _yellow poplar_. It is light, soft, not strong and easily worked. It
    is used in construction, for interior finish of houses, woodenware
    and shingles. It has a medicinal value.

Other characters: The _flower_, shown in Fig. 75, is greenish yellow in
    color, appears in May and resembles a tulip; hence the name tulip
    tree. The _fruit_ is a cone.

Other common names: _Whitewood_; _yellow poplar_; _poplar_ and _tulip
    poplar_.


SWEET GUM (_Liquidambar styraciflua_)

[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Leaf and Flower of the Tulip Tree.]

Distinguishing characters: The _persistent, spiny_, long-stemmed round
    *fruit*; _the corky growths on the_ *twigs*, the characteristic
    _star-shaped_ *leaves* (Fig. 76) and the very shiny greenish brown
    buds and the perfect symmetry of the tree are the chief characters
    by which to identify the species.

Form and size: The sweet gum has a beautiful symmetrical shape, forming
    a true monopodium.

[Illustration: FIG. 76.--Leaf and Fruit of the Sweet Gum. Note the corky
ridges along the twig.]

Range: From Connecticut to Florida and west to Missouri.

Soil and location: Grows in any good soil but prefers low wet ground. It
    grows rapidly and needs plenty of light.

Enemies: Is very often a favorite of leaf-eating caterpillars.

Value for planting: The tree is sought for the brilliant color of its
    foliage in the fall, and is suitable for planting both on the lawn
    and street. In growing the tree for ornamental purposes it is
    important that it should be frequently transplanted in the nursery
    and that it be transported with burlap wrapping around its roots.

Commercial value: The wood is reddish brown in color, tends to splinter
    and is inclined to warp in drying. It is used in cooperage, veneer
    work and for interior finish.

Other characters: On the smaller branches there are irregular
    developments of cork as shown in Fig. 76, projecting in some cases
    to half an inch in thickness.

Other common names: _Red gum_.

Comparisons: The _cork elm_ is another tree that possesses corky ridges
    along its twigs, but this differs from the sweet gum in wanting the
    spiny fruit and its other distinctive traits.


AMERICAN LINDEN (_Tilia Americana_)

[Illustration: FIG. 77.--Bud of the Linden Tree.]

Distinguishing characters: The great distinguishing feature of any
    linden is the *one-sided* character of its *bud* and *leaf*. The
    bud, dark red and conical, carries a sort of protuberance which
    makes it extremely one sided as shown in Fig. 77. The leaf, Fig. 78,
    is heart-shaped with the side nearest the branch largest.

[Illustration: FIG. 78.--Leaves and Flowers of the European Linden.]

Form and size: The American Linden is a medium-sized tree with a broad
    round head.

Range: Eastern North America and more common in the north than in the
    south.

Soil and location: Requires a rich, moist soil.

[Illustration: FIG. 79.--European Linden Tree.]

[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Bud of the Umbrella Tree.]

Enemies: Its leaves are a favorite food of caterpillars and its wood is
    frequently attacked by a boring insect known as the _linden borer_
    (_Saperda vestita_).

Value for planting: The linden is easily transplanted and grows rapidly.
It is used for lawn and street planting but is less desirable for these
purposes than the European species.

Commercial value: The wood is light and soft and used for paper pulp,
    woodenware, cooperage and furniture. The tree is a favorite with bee
    keepers on account of the large quantities of nectar contained in
    its flowers.

Other characters: The _fruit_ is like a pea, gray and woody. The
    _flowers_ appear in early July, are greenish-yellow and very
    fragrant.

Other common names: _Bass-wood_; _lime-tree_; _whitewood_.

Comparisons: The _European lindens_, Fig. 79, of which there are several
    species under cultivation, differ from the native species in having
    buds and leaves smaller in size, more numerous and darker in color.


THE MAGNOLIAS

The various species of magnolia trees are readily distinguished by their
buds. They all prefer moist, rich soil and have their principal value as
decorative trees on the lawn. They are distinctly southern trees; some
species under cultivation in the United States come from Asia, but the
two most commonly grown in the Eastern States are the cucumber tree and
the umbrella tree.

[Illustration: FIG. 81.--Bark of the Black Locust.]


CUCUMBER TREE (_Magnolia acuminata_)

Distinguishing characters: The *buds* are _small_ and _slender_ compared
    with those of the other magnolia trees and are _covered_ with small
    silvery silky _hairs_. The *habit* of the tree is to form a straight
    axis of great height with a symmetrical mass of branches, producing
    a perfect monopodial crown. The tree is sometimes known as _mountain
    magnolia_.


UMBRELLA TREE (_Magnolia tripetala_)

Distinguishing characters: The _buds_, Fig. 80, are extremely _long_,
    often one and a half inches, have a _purple color_ and _are smooth_.
    The tree does not grow to large size and produces an open spreading
    head. Its leaves, twelve to eighteen inches long, are larger than
    those of the other magnolia trees. The tree is sometimes called
    _elkwood_.


BLACK LOCUST (_Robinia pseudacacia_)

Distinguishing characters: The *bark* of the trunk is _rough_ and
    _deeply ridged_, as shown in Fig. 81. The *buds* are _hardly
    noticeable_; the twigs sometimes bear small spines on one side. The
    leaves are large, compound, and fern-like. The individual leaflets
    are small and delicate.

Form and size: The locust is a medium-sized tree developing a slender
    straight trunk when grown alongside of others; see Fig. 82.

Range: Canada and United States.

Soil and location: The locust will grow on almost any soil except a wet,
    heavy one. It requires plenty of light.

Enemies: The _locust borer_ has done serious damage to this tree. The
