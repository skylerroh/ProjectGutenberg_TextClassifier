the prussic acid. As no evidence of its decomposition has hitherto
appeared, we are fully entitled to consider azote as a simple elementary
substance.

SECT. VII.--_Observations upon Hydrogen, and its Combinations with
Simple Substances._

Hydrogen, as its name expresses, is one of the constituent elements of
water, of which it forms fifteen hundredth parts by weight, combined
with eighty-five hundredth parts of oxygen. This substance, the
properties and even existence of which was unknown till lately, is very
plentifully distributed in nature, and acts a very considerable part in
the processes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. As it possesses so
great affinity with caloric as only to exist in the state of gas, it is
consequently impossible to procure it in the concrete or liquid state,
independent of combination.

To procure hydrogen, or rather hydrogen gas, we have only to subject
water to the action of a substance with which oxygen has greater
affinity than it has to hydrogen; by this means the hydrogen is set
free, and, by uniting with caloric, assumes the form of hydrogen gas.
Red hot iron is usually employed for this purpose: The iron, during the
process, becomes oxydated, and is changed into a substance resembling
the iron ore from the island of Elba. In this state of oxyd it is much
less attractible by the magnet, and dissolves in acids without
effervescence.

Charcoal, in a red heat, has the same power of decomposing water, by
attracting the oxygen from its combination with hydrogen. In this
process carbonic acid gas is formed, and mixes with the hydrogen gas,
but is easily separated by means of water or alkalies, which absorb the
carbonic acid, and leave the hydrogen gas pure. We may likewise obtain
hydrogen gas by dissolving iron or zinc in dilute sulphuric acid. These
two metals decompose water very slowly, and with great difficulty, when
alone, but do it with great ease and rapidity when assisted by sulphuric
acid; the hydrogen unites with caloric during the process, and is
disengaged in form of hydrogen gas, while the oxygen of the water unites
with the metal in the form of oxyd, which is immediately dissolved in
the acid, forming a sulphat of iron or of zinc.

Some very distinguished chemists consider hydrogen as the _phlogiston_
of Stahl; and as that celebrated chemist admitted the existence of
phlogiston in sulphur, charcoal, metals, &c. they are of course obliged
to suppose that hydrogen exists in all these substances, though they
cannot prove their supposition; even if they could, it would not avail
much, since this disengagement of hydrogen is quite insufficient to
explain the phenomena of calcination and combustion. We must always
recur to the examination of this question, "Are the heat and light,
which are disengaged during the different species of combustion,
furnished by the burning body, or by the oxygen which combines in all
these operations?" And certainly the supposition of hydrogen being
disengaged throws no light whatever upon this question. Besides, it
belongs to those who make suppositions to prove them; and, doubtless, a
doctrine which without any supposition explains the phenomena as well,
and as naturally, as theirs does by supposition, has at least the
advantage of greater simplicity[40].

SECT. VIII.--_Observations on Sulphur, and its Combinations._

Sulphur is a combustible substance, having a very great tendency to
combination; it is naturally in a solid state in the ordinary
temperature, and requires a heat somewhat higher than boiling water to
make it liquify. Sulphur is formed by nature in a considerable degree of
purity in the neighbourhood of volcanos; we find it likewise, chiefly in
the state of sulphuric acid, combined with argill in aluminous schistus,
with lime in gypsum, &c. From these combinations it may be procured in
the state of sulphur, by carrying off its oxygen by means of charcoal in
a red heat; carbonic acid is formed, and escapes in the state of gas;
the sulphur remains combined with the clay, lime, &c. in the state of
sulphuret, which is decomposed by acids; the acid unites with the earth
into a neutral salt, and the sulphur is precipitated.

SECT. IX.--_Observations upon Phosphorus, and its Combinations._

Phosphorus is a simple combustible substance, which was unknown to
chemists till 1667, when it was discovered by Brandt, who kept the
process secret; soon after Kunkel found out Brandt's method of
preparation, and made it public. It has been ever since known by the
name of Kunkel's phosphorus. It was for a long time procured only from
urine; and, though Homberg gave an account of the process in the Memoirs
of the Academy for 1692, all the philosophers of Europe were supplied
with it from England. It was first made in France in 1737, before a
committee of the Academy at the Royal Garden. At present it is procured
in a more commodious and more oeconomical manner from animal bones,
which are real calcareous phosphats, according to the process of Messrs
Gahn, Scheele, Rouelle, &c. The bones of adult animals being calcined to
whiteness, are pounded, and passed through a fine silk sieve; pour upon
the fine powder a quantity of dilute sulphuric acid, less than is
sufficient for dissolving the whole. This acid unites with the
calcareous earth of the bones into a sulphat of lime, and the phosphoric
acid remains free in the liquor. The liquid is decanted off, and the
residuum washed with boiling water; this water which has been used to
wash out the adhering acid is joined with what was before decanted off,
and the whole is gradually evaporated; the dissolved sulphat of lime
cristallizes in form of silky threads, which are removed, and by
continuing the evaporation we procure the phosphoric acid under the
appearance of a white pellucid glass. When this is powdered, and mixed
with one third its weight of charcoal, we procure very pure phosphorus
by sublimation. The phosphoric acid, as procured by the above process,
is never so pure as that obtained by oxygenating pure phosphorus either
by combustion or by means of nitric acid; wherefore this latter should
always be employed in experiments of research.

Phosphorus is found in almost all animal substances, and in some plants
which give a kind of animal analysis. In all these it is usually
combined with charcoal, hydrogen, and azote, forming very compound
radicals, which are, for the most part, in the state of oxyds by a first
degree of union with oxygen. The discovery of Mr Hassenfratz, of
phosphorus being contained in charcoal, gives reason to suspect that it
is more common in the vegetable kingdom than has generally been
supposed: It is certain, that, by proper processes, it may be procured
from every individual of some of the families of plants.

As no experiment has hitherto given reason to suspect that phosphorus is
a compound body, I have arranged it with the simple or elementary
substances. It takes fire at the temperature of 32 deg. (104 deg.) of the
thermometer.

SECT. X.--_Observations upon Charcoal, and its Combinations with Simple
Substances._

As charcoal has not been hitherto decomposed, it must, in the present
state of our knowledge, be considered as a simple substance. By modern
experiments it appears to exist ready formed in vegetables; and I have
already remarked, that, in these, it is combined with hydrogen,
sometimes with azote and phosphorus, forming compound radicals, which
may be changed into oxyds or acids according to their degree of
oxygenation.

To obtain the charcoal contained in vegetable or animal substances, we
subject them to the action of fire, at first moderate, and afterwards
very strong, on purpose to drive off the last portions of water, which
adhere very obstinately to the charcoal. For chemical purposes, this is
usually done in retorts of stone-ware or porcellain, into which the
wood, or other matter, is introduced, and then placed in a reverberatory
furnace, raised gradually to its greatest heat: The heat volatilizes, or
changes into gas, all the parts of the body susceptible of combining
with caloric into that form, and the charcoal, being more fixed in its
nature, remains in the retort combined with a little earth and some
fixed salts.

In the business of charring wood, this is done by a less expensive
process. The wood is disposed in heaps, and covered with earth, so as to
prevent the access of any more air than is absolutely necessary for
supporting the fire, which is kept up till all the water and oil is
driven off, after which the fire is extinguished by shutting up all the
air-holes.

We may analyse charcoal either by combustion in air, or rather in oxygen
gas, or by means of nitric acid. In either case we convert it into
carbonic acid, and sometimes a little potash and some neutral salts
remain. This analysis has hitherto been but little attended to by
chemists; and we are not even certain if potash exists in charcoal
before combustion, or whether it be formed by means of some unknown
combination during that process.


SECT. XI.--_Observations upon the Muriatic, Fluoric, and Boracic
Radicals, and their Combinations._

As the combinations of these substances, either with each other, or with
the other combustible bodies, are hitherto entirely unknown, we have
not attempted to form any table for their nomenclature. We only know
that these radicals are susceptible of oxygenation, and of forming the
muriatic, fluoric, and boracic acids, and that in the acid state they
enter into a number of combinations, to be afterwards detailed.
Chemistry has hitherto been unable to disoxygenate any of them, so as to
produce them in a simple state. For this purpose, some substance must be
employed to which oxygen has a stronger affinity than to their radicals,
either by means of single affinity, or by double elective attraction.
All that is known relative to the origin of the radicals of these acids
will be mentioned in the sections set apart for considering their
combinations with the salifiable bases.


SECT. XII.--_Observations upon the Combinations of Metals with each
other._

Before closing our account of the simple or elementary substances, it
might be supposed necessary to give a table of alloys or combinations of
metals with each other; but, as such a table would be both exceedingly
voluminous and very unsatisfactory, without going into a series of
experiments not yet attempted, I have thought it adviseable to omit it
altogether. All that is necessary to be mentioned is, that these alloys
should be named according to the metal in largest proportion in the
mixture or combination; thus the term _alloy of gold and silver_, or
gold alloyed with silver, indicates that gold is the predominating
metal.

Metallic alloys, like all other combinations, have a point of
saturation. It would even appear, from the experiments of Mr de la
Briche, that they have two perfectly distinct degrees of saturation.

SECT. XIII.--_Observations upon the Nitrous and Nitric Acids, and their
Combinations._

The nitrous and nitric acids are procured from a neutral salt long known
in the arts under the name of _saltpetre_. This salt is extracted by
lixiviation from the rubbish of old buildings, from the earth of
cellars, stables, or barns, and in general of all inhabited places. In
these earths the nitric acid is usually combined with lime and magnesia,
sometimes with potash, and rarely with argill. As all these salts,
excepting the nitrat of potash, attract the moisture of the air, and
consequently would be difficultly preserved, advantage is taken, in the
manufactures of saltpetre and the royal refining house, of the greater
affinity of the nitric acid to potash than these other bases, by which
means the lime, magnesia, and argill, are precipitated, and all these
nitrats are reduced to the nitrat of potash or saltpetre[41].

The nitric acid is procured from this salt by distillation, from three
parts of pure saltpetre decomposed by one part of concentrated
sulphuric acid, in a retort with Woulfe's apparatus, (Pl. IV. fig. 1.)
having its bottles half filled with water, and all its joints carefully
luted. The nitrous acid passes over in form of red vapours surcharged
with nitrous gas, or, in other words, not saturated with oxygen. Part of
the acid condenses in the recipient in form of a dark orange red liquid,
while the rest combines with the water in the bottles. During the
distillation, a large quantity of oxygen gas escapes, owing to the
greater affinity of oxygen to caloric, in a high temperature, than to
nitrous acid, though in the usual temperature of the atmosphere this
affinity is reversed. It is from the disengagement of oxygen that the
nitric acid of the neutral salt is in this operation converted into
nitrous acid. It is brought back to the state of nitric acid by heating
over a gentle fire, which drives off the superabundant nitrous gas, and
leaves the nitric acid much diluted with water.

Nitric acid is procurable in a more concentrated state, and with much
less loss, by mixing very dry clay with saltpetre. This mixture is put
