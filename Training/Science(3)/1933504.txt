Bodies to reflect and refract Light, are very nearly proportional to the
densities of the same Bodies; excepting that unctuous and sulphureous
Bodies refract more than others of this same density._

[Illustration: FIG. 8.]

Let AB represent the refracting plane Surface of any Body, and IC a Ray
incident very obliquely upon the Body in C, so that the Angle ACI may be
infinitely little, and let CR be the refracted Ray. From a given Point B
perpendicular to the refracting Surface erect BR meeting with the
refracting Ray CR in R, and if CR represent the Motion of the refracted
Ray, and this Motion be distinguish'd into two Motions CB and BR,
whereof CB is parallel to the refracting Plane, and BR perpendicular to
it: CB shall represent the Motion of the incident Ray, and BR the
Motion generated by the Refraction, as Opticians have of late explain'd.

Now if any Body or Thing, in moving through any Space of a given breadth
terminated on both sides by two parallel Planes, be urged forward in all
parts of that Space by Forces tending directly forwards towards the last
Plane, and before its Incidence on the first Plane, had no Motion
towards it, or but an infinitely little one; and if the Forces in all
parts of that Space, between the Planes, be at equal distances from the
Planes equal to one another, but at several distances be bigger or less
in any given Proportion, the Motion generated by the Forces in the whole
passage of the Body or thing through that Space shall be in a
subduplicate Proportion of the Forces, as Mathematicians will easily
understand. And therefore, if the Space of activity of the refracting
Superficies of the Body be consider'd as such a Space, the Motion of the
Ray generated by the refracting Force of the Body, during its passage
through that Space, that is, the Motion BR, must be in subduplicate
Proportion of that refracting Force. I say therefore, that the Square of
the Line BR, and by consequence the refracting Force of the Body, is
very nearly as the density of the same Body. For this will appear by the
following Table, wherein the Proportion of the Sines which measure the
Refractions of several Bodies, the Square of BR, supposing CB an unite,
the Densities of the Bodies estimated by their Specifick Gravities, and
their Refractive Power in respect of their Densities are set down in
several Columns.

The Refraction of the Air in this Table is determin'd by that of the
Atmosphere observed by Astronomers. For, if Light pass through many
refracting Substances or Mediums gradually denser and denser, and
terminated with parallel Surfaces, the Sum of all the Refractions will
be equal to the single Refraction which it would have suffer'd in
passing immediately out of the first Medium into the last. And this
holds true, though the Number of the refracting Substances be increased
to Infinity, and the Distances from one another as much decreased, so
that the Light may be refracted in every Point of its Passage, and by
continual Refractions bent into a Curve-Line. And therefore the whole
Refraction of Light in passing through the Atmosphere from the highest
and rarest Part thereof down to the lowest and densest Part, must be
equal to the Refraction which it would suffer in passing at like
Obliquity out of a Vacuum immediately into Air of equal Density with
that in the lowest Part of the Atmosphere.

Now, although a Pseudo-Topaz, a Selenitis, Rock Crystal, Island Crystal,
Vulgar Glass (that is, Sand melted together) and Glass of Antimony,
which are terrestrial stony alcalizate Concretes, and Air which probably
arises from such Substances by Fermentation, be Substances very
differing from one another in Density, yet by this Table, they have
their refractive Powers almost in the same Proportion to one another as
their Densities are, excepting that the Refraction of that strange
Substance, Island Crystal is a little bigger than the rest. And
particularly Air, which is 3500 Times rarer than the Pseudo-Topaz, and
4400 Times rarer than Glass of Antimony, and 2000 Times rarer than the
Selenitis, Glass vulgar, or Crystal of the Rock, has notwithstanding its
rarity the same refractive Power in respect of its Density which those
very dense Substances have in respect of theirs, excepting so far as
those differ from one another.

Again, the Refraction of Camphire, Oil Olive, Linseed Oil, Spirit of
Turpentine and Amber, which are fat sulphureous unctuous Bodies, and a
Diamond, which probably is an unctuous Substance coagulated, have their
refractive Powers in Proportion to one another as their Densities
without any considerable Variation. But the refractive Powers of these
unctuous Substances are two or three Times greater in respect of their
Densities than the refractive Powers of the former Substances in respect
of theirs.

Water has a refractive Power in a middle degree between those two sorts
of Substances, and probably is of a middle nature. For out of it grow
all vegetable and animal Substances, which consist as well of
sulphureous fat and inflamable Parts, as of earthy lean and alcalizate
ones.

Salts and Vitriols have refractive Powers in a middle degree between
those of earthy Substances and Water, and accordingly are composed of
those two sorts of Substances. For by distillation and rectification of
their Spirits a great Part of them goes into Water, and a great Part
remains behind in the form of a dry fix'd Earth capable of
Vitrification.

Spirit of Wine has a refractive Power in a middle degree between those
of Water and oily Substances, and accordingly seems to be composed of
both, united by Fermentation; the Water, by means of some saline Spirits
with which 'tis impregnated, dissolving the Oil, and volatizing it by
the Action. For Spirit of Wine is inflamable by means of its oily Parts,
and being distilled often from Salt of Tartar, grow by every
distillation more and more aqueous and phlegmatick. And Chymists
observe, that Vegetables (as Lavender, Rue, Marjoram, &c.) distilled
_per se_, before fermentation yield Oils without any burning Spirits,
but after fermentation yield ardent Spirits without Oils: Which shews,
that their Oil is by fermentation converted into Spirit. They find also,
that if Oils be poured in a small quantity upon fermentating Vegetables,
they distil over after fermentation in the form of Spirits.

So then, by the foregoing Table, all Bodies seem to have their
refractive Powers proportional to their Densities, (or very nearly;)
excepting so far as they partake more or less of sulphureous oily
Particles, and thereby have their refractive Power made greater or less.
Whence it seems rational to attribute the refractive Power of all Bodies
chiefly, if not wholly, to the sulphureous Parts with which they abound.
For it's probable that all Bodies abound more or less with Sulphurs. And
as Light congregated by a Burning-glass acts most upon sulphureous
Bodies, to turn them into Fire and Flame; so, since all Action is
mutual, Sulphurs ought to act most upon Light. For that the action
between Light and Bodies is mutual, may appear from this Consideration;
That the densest Bodies which refract and reflect Light most strongly,
grow hottest in the Summer Sun, by the action of the refracted or
reflected Light.

I have hitherto explain'd the power of Bodies to reflect and refract,
and shew'd, that thin transparent Plates, Fibres, and Particles, do,
according to their several thicknesses and densities, reflect several
sorts of Rays, and thereby appear of several Colours; and by consequence
that nothing more is requisite for producing all the Colours of natural
Bodies, than the several sizes and densities of their transparent
Particles. But whence it is that these Plates, Fibres, and Particles,
do, according to their several thicknesses and densities, reflect
several sorts of Rays, I have not yet explain'd. To give some insight
into this matter, and make way for understanding the next part of this
Book, I shall conclude this part with a few more Propositions. Those
which preceded respect the nature of Bodies, these the nature of Light:
For both must be understood, before the reason of their Actions upon one
another can be known. And because the last Proposition depended upon the
velocity of Light, I will begin with a Proposition of that kind.


PROP. XI.

_Light is propagated from luminous Bodies in time, and spends about
seven or eight Minutes of an Hour in passing from the Sun to the Earth._

This was observed first by _Roemer_, and then by others, by means of the
Eclipses of the Satellites of _Jupiter_. For these Eclipses, when the
Earth is between the Sun and _Jupiter_, happen about seven or eight
Minutes sooner than they ought to do by the Tables, and when the Earth
is beyond the Sun they happen about seven or eight Minutes later than
they ought to do; the reason being, that the Light of the Satellites has
farther to go in the latter case than in the former by the Diameter of
the Earth's Orbit. Some inequalities of time may arise from the
Excentricities of the Orbs of the Satellites; but those cannot answer in
all the Satellites, and at all times to the Position and Distance of the
Earth from the Sun. The mean motions of _Jupiter_'s Satellites is also
swifter in his descent from his Aphelium to his Perihelium, than in his
ascent in the other half of his Orb. But this inequality has no respect
to the position of the Earth, and in the three interior Satellites is
insensible, as I find by computation from the Theory of their Gravity.


PROP. XII.

_Every Ray of Light in its passage through any refracting Surface is put
into a certain transient Constitution or State, which in the progress of
the Ray returns at equal Intervals, and disposes the Ray at every return
to be easily transmitted through the next refracting Surface, and
between the returns to be easily reflected by it._

This is manifest by the 5th, 9th, 12th, and 15th Observations. For by
those Observations it appears, that one and the same sort of Rays at
equal Angles of Incidence on any thin transparent Plate, is alternately
reflected and transmitted for many Successions accordingly as the
thickness of the Plate increases in arithmetical Progression of the
Numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, &c. so that if the first Reflexion
(that which makes the first or innermost of the Rings of Colours there
described) be made at the thickness 1, the Rays shall be transmitted at
the thicknesses 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, &c. and thereby make the central
Spot and Rings of Light, which appear by transmission, and be reflected
at the thickness 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, &c. and thereby make the Rings which
appear by Reflexion. And this alternate Reflexion and Transmission, as I
gather by the 24th Observation, continues for above an hundred
vicissitudes, and by the Observations in the next part of this Book, for
many thousands, being propagated from one Surface of a Glass Plate to
the other, though the thickness of the Plate be a quarter of an Inch or
above: So that this alternation seems to be propagated from every
refracting Surface to all distances without end or limitation.

This alternate Reflexion and Refraction depends on both the Surfaces of
every thin Plate, because it depends on their distance. By the 21st
Observation, if either Surface of a thin Plate of _Muscovy_ Glass be
wetted, the Colours caused by the alternate Reflexion and Refraction
grow faint, and therefore it depends on them both.

It is therefore perform'd at the second Surface; for if it were
perform'd at the first, before the Rays arrive at the second, it would
not depend on the second.

It is also influenced by some action or disposition, propagated from the
first to the second, because otherwise at the second it would not depend
on the first. And this action or disposition, in its propagation,
intermits and returns by equal Intervals, because in all its progress it
inclines the Ray at one distance from the first Surface to be reflected
by the second, at another to be transmitted by it, and that by equal
Intervals for innumerable vicissitudes. And because the Ray is disposed
to Reflexion at the distances 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, &c. and to Transmission at
the distances 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, &c. (for its transmission through the
first Surface, is at the distance 0, and it is transmitted through both
together, if their distance be infinitely little or much less than 1)
the disposition to be transmitted at the distances 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, &c.
is to be accounted a return of the same disposition which the Ray first
had at the distance 0, that is at its transmission through the first
refracting Surface. All which is the thing I would prove.

What kind of action or disposition this is; Whether it consists in a
circulating or a vibrating motion of the Ray, or of the Medium, or
something else, I do not here enquire. Those that are averse from
assenting to any new Discoveries, but such as they can explain by an
Hypothesis, may for the present suppose, that as Stones by falling upon
Water put the Water into an undulating Motion, and all Bodies by
percussion excite vibrations in the Air; so the Rays of Light, by
impinging on any refracting or reflecting Surface, excite vibrations in
the refracting or reflecting Medium or Substance, and by exciting them
agitate the solid parts of the refracting or reflecting Body, and by
agitating them cause the Body to grow warm or hot; that the vibrations
thus excited are propagated in the refracting or reflecting Medium or
Substance, much after the manner that vibrations are propagated in the
Air for causing Sound, and move faster than the Rays so as to overtake
them; and that when any Ray is in that part of the vibration which
conspires with its Motion, it easily breaks through a refracting
Surface, but when it is in the contrary part of the vibration which
impedes its Motion, it is easily reflected; and, by consequence, that
every Ray is successively disposed to be easily reflected, or easily
transmitted, by every vibration which overtakes it. But whether this
Hypothesis be true or false I do not here consider. I content my self
with the bare Discovery, that the Rays of Light are by some cause or
other alternately disposed to be reflected or refracted for many
vicissitudes.


DEFINITION.

_The returns of the disposition of any Ray to be reflected I will call
its_ Fits of easy Reflexion, _and those of its disposition to be
transmitted its_ Fits of easy Transmission, _and the space it passes
between every return and the next return, the_ Interval of its Fits.


PROP. XIII.

_The reason why the Surfaces of all thick transparent Bodies reflect
part of the Light incident on them, and refract the rest, is, that some
Rays at their Incidence are in Fits of easy Reflexion, and others in
Fits of easy Transmission._

This may be gather'd from the 24th Observation, where the Light
reflected by thin Plates of Air and Glass, which to the naked Eye
appear'd evenly white all over the Plate, did through a Prism appear
waved with many Successions of Light and Darkness made by alternate Fits
of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission, the Prism severing and
distinguishing the Waves of which the white reflected Light was
composed, as was explain'd above.

And hence Light is in Fits of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission,
before its Incidence on transparent Bodies. And probably it is put into
such fits at its first emission from luminous Bodies, and continues in
them during all its progress. For these Fits are of a lasting nature, as
will appear by the next part of this Book.

In this Proposition I suppose the transparent Bodies to be thick;
because if the thickness of the Body be much less than the Interval of
the Fits of easy Reflexion and Transmission of the Rays, the Body loseth
its reflecting power. For if the Rays, which at their entering into the
Body are put into Fits of easy Transmission, arrive at the farthest
Surface of the Body before they be out of those Fits, they must be
transmitted. And this is the reason why Bubbles of Water lose their
reflecting power when they grow very thin; and why all opake Bodies,
when reduced into very small parts, become transparent.


PROP. XIV.

_Those Surfaces of transparent Bodies, which if the Ray be in a Fit of
Refraction do refract it most strongly, if the Ray be in a Fit of
