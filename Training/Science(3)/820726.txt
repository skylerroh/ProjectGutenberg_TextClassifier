exploitation?" he began. "This is a flagrant violation of the Imperial
Constitution; our Emperor will not be pleased at this unjustified
intervention in the affairs, and this interference with the planetary
authority, of the People's Commonwealth of Aditya!"

Obray of Erskyll must have realized, for the first time, that he was
still holding a highball glass in one hand and a cigarette in the other.
He flung both of them away.

"If the Imperial troops we are sending into the city to rescue women and
children in danger from your hoodlums meet with the least resistance,
you won't be in a position to find out what his Majesty thinks about it,
because Admiral Shatrak will have you and your accomplices shot in the
Convocation Chamber, where you massacred the legitimate government of
this planet," he barked.

So the real Obray, Count Erskyll, had at last emerged. All the
liberalism and socialism and egalitarianism, all the Helping-Hand,
Torch-of-Democracy, idealism, was merely a surface stucco applied at the
university during the last six years. For twenty-four years before that,
from the day of his birth, he had been taught, by his parents, his
nurse, his governess, his tutors, what it meant to be an Erskyll of Aton
and a grandson of Errol, Duke of Yorvoy. As he watched Khreggor Chmidd
in the screen, he grew angrier, if possible.

"Do you know what you blood-thirsty imbeciles have done?" he demanded.
"You have just murdered, along with two thousand men, some five billion
crowns, the money needed to finance all these fine modernization and
industrialization plans. Or are you crazy enough to think that the
Empire is going to indemnify you for being emancipated and pay that
money over to you?"

"But, Citizen Proconsul...."

"And don't call me Citizen Proconsul! I am a noble of the Galactic
Empire, and on this pigpen of a planet I represent his Imperial Majesty.
You will respect, and address, me accordingly."

Khreggor Chmidd no longer wore the gorget of servility, but, as Lanze
Degbrend had once remarked, it was still tattooed on his soul. He
gulped.

"Y-yes, Lord-Master Proconsul!"

They were together again in the big conference-room, which Vann Shatrak
had been using, through the day, as an extemporised Battle-Control. They
slumped wearily in chairs; they smoked and drank coffee; they anxiously
looked from viewscreen to viewscreen, wondering when, and how soon, the
trouble would break out again. It was dark, outside, now. Floodlights
threw a white dazzle from the top of the Proconsular Palace and from the
tops of the four buildings around it that Imperial troops had cleared
and occupied, and from contragravity vehicles above. There was light and
activity at the Citadel, and in the Servile City to the south-east; the
rest of Zeggensburg was dark and quiet.

"I don't think we'll have any more trouble," Admiral Shatrak was saying.
"They won't be fools enough to attack us here, and all the Masters are
dead, except for the ones we're sheltering."

"How many did we save?" Count Erskyll asked.

Eight hundred odd, Shatrak told him. Erskyll caught his breath.

"So few! Why, there were almost twelve thousand of them in the city this
morning."

"I'm surprised we saved so many," Lanze Degbrend said. He still wore
combat coveralls, and a pistol-belt lay beside his chair. "Most of them
were killed in the first hour."

And that had been before the landing-craft from the ships had gotten
down, and there had only been seven hundred men and forty vehicles
available. He had gone out with them, himself; it had been the first
time he had worn battle-dress and helmet or carried a weapon except for
sport in almost thirty years. It had been an ugly, bloody, business; one
he wanted to forget as speedily as possible. There had been times, after
seeing the mutilated bodies of Masterly women and children, when he had
been forced to remind himself that he had come out to prevent, not to
participate in, a massacre. Some of Ravney's men hadn't even tried.
Atrocity has a horrible facility for begetting atrocity.

"What'll we do with them?" Erskyll asked. "We can't turn them loose;
they'd all be murdered in a matter of hours, and in any case, they'd
have nowhere to go. The Commonwealth,"--he pronounced the name he had
himself selected as though it were an obscenity--"has nationalized all
the Masterly property."

That had been announced almost as soon as the Citadel telecast-station
had been unjammed, and shortly thereafter they had begun encountering
bodies of Yakoop Zhannar's soldiers and Zhorzh Khouzhik's police who had
been sent out to stop looting and vandalism and occupy the Masterly
palaces. There had been considerable shooting in the Servile City;
evidently the ex-slaves had to be convinced that they must not pillage
or destroy their places of employment.

"Evacuate them off-planet," Shatrak said. "As soon as _Algol_ gets here,
we'll load the lot of them onto _Mizar_ or _Canopus_ and haul them
somewhere. Ghu only knows how they'll live, but...."

"Oh, they won't be paupers, or public charges, Admiral," he said. "You
know, there's an estimated five billion crowns in slave-compensation,
and when I return to Odin I shall represent most strongly that these
survivors be paid the whole sum. But I shall emphatically not recommend
that they be resettled on Odin. They won't be at all grateful to us for
today's business, and on Odin they could easily stir up some very
adverse public sentiment."

"My resignation will answer any criticism of the Establishment the
public may make," Erskyll began.

"Oh, rubbish; don't talk about resigning, Obray. You made a few mistakes
here, though I can't think of a better planet in the Galaxy on which you
could have made them. But no matter what you did or did not do, this
would have happened eventually."

"You really think so?" Obray, Count Erskyll, was desperately anxious to
be assured of that. "Perhaps if I hadn't been so insistent on this
constitution...."

"That wouldn't have made a particle of difference. We all made this
inevitable simply by coming here. Before we came, it would have been
impossible. No slave would have been able even to imagine a society
without Lords-Master; you heard Chmidd and Hozhet, the first day, aboard
the _Empress Eulalie_. A slave had to have a Master; he simply couldn't
belong to nobody at all. And until you started talking socialization,
nobody could have imagined property without a Masterly property-owning
class. And a massacre like this would have been impossible to organize
or execute. For one thing, it required an elaborate conspiratorial
organization, and until we emancipated them, no slave would have dared
trust any other slave; every one would have betrayed any other to curry
favor with his Lord-Master. We taught them that they didn't need
Lords-Master, or Masterly favor, any more. And we presented them with a
situation their established routines didn't cover, and forced them into
doing some original thinking, which must have hurt like Nifflheim at
first. And we retrained the army and handed it over to Yakoop Zhannar,
and inspired Zhorzh Khouzhik to organize the Labor Police, and
fundamentally, no government is anything but armed force. Really, Obray,
I can't see that you can be blamed for anything but speeding up an
inevitable process slightly."

"You think they'll see it that way at Asgard?"

"You mean the Prime Minister and His Majesty? That will be the way I
shall present it to them. That was another reason I wanted to stay on
here. I anticipated that you might want a credible witness to what was
going to happen," he said. "Now, you'll be here for not more than five
years before you're promoted elsewhere. Nobody remains longer than that
on a first Proconsular appointment. Just keep your eyes and ears and,
especially, your mind, open while you are here. You will learn many
things undreamed-of by the political-science faculty at the University
of Nefertiti."

"You said I made mistakes," Erskyll mentioned, ready to start learning
immediately.

"Yes. I pointed one of them out to you some time ago: emotional
involvement with local groups. You began sympathizing with the servile
class here almost immediately. I don't think either of us learned
anything about them that the other didn't, yet I found them despicable,
one and all. Why did you think them worthy of your sympathy?"

"Why, because...." For a moment, that was as far as he could get. His
motivation had been thalamic rather than cortical and he was having
trouble externalizing it verbally. "They were _slaves_. They were being
exploited and oppressed...."

"And, of course, their exploiters were a lot of heartless villains, so
that made the slaves good and virtuous innocents. That was your real,
fundamental, mistake. You know, Obray, the downtrodden and
long-suffering proletariat aren't at all good or innocent or virtuous.
They are just incompetent; they lack the abilities necessary for overt
villainy. You saw, this afternoon, what they were capable of doing when
they were given an opportunity. You know, it's quite all right to give
the underdog a hand, but only one hand. Keep the other hand on your
pistol--or he'll try to eat the one you gave him! As you may have
noticed, today, when underdogs get up, they tend to turn out to be
wolves."

"What do you think this Commonwealth will develop into, under Chmidd and
Hozhet and Khouzhik and the rest?" Lanze Degbrend asked, to keep the
lecture going.

"Oh, a slave-state, of course; look who's running it, and whom it will
govern. Not the kind of a slave-state we can do anything about," he
hastened to add. "The Commonwealth will be very definite about
recognizing that sapient beings cannot be property. But all the rest of
the property will belong to the Commonwealth. Remember that remark of
Chmidd's: 'It will belong to everybody, but somebody will have to take
care of it for everybody. That will be you and me.'"

Erskyll frowned. "I remember that. I didn't like it, at the time. It
sounded...."

Out of character, for a good and virtuous proletarian; almost Masterly,
in fact. He continued:

"The Commonwealth will be sole employer as well as sole property-owner,
and anybody who wants to eat will have to work for the Commonwealth on
the Commonwealth's terms. Chmidd's and Hozhet's and Khouzhik's, that is.
If that isn't substitution of peonage for chattel slavery, I don't know
what the word peonage means. But you'll do nothing to interfere. You
will see to it that Aditya stays in the empire and adheres to the
Constitution and makes no trouble for anybody off-planet. I fancy you
won't find that too difficult. They'll be good, as long as you deny them
the means to be anything else. And make sure that they continue to call
you Lord-Master Proconsul."

Lecturing, he found, was dry work. He summoned a bartending robot:

"Ho, slave! Attend your Lord-Master!"

Then he had to use his ultraviolet pencil-light to bring it to him, and
dial for the brandy-and-soda he wanted. As long as that was necessary,
there really wasn't anything to worry about. But some of these days,
they'd build robots that would anticipate orders, and robots to operate
robots, and robots to supervise them, and....

No. It wouldn't quite come to that. A slave is a slave, but a robot is
only a robot. As long as they stuck to robots, they were reasonably
safe.
