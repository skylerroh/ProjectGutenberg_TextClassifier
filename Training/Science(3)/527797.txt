Frankie was confused. "I wanted to go on my own. Why didn't you tell me
then?"

"Then you'd have lost. You'd have gone down whimpering and moaning. You
see, Frankie, all those old fighters had a vital ingredient--the thing
it takes to make a champion--courage."

"And you didn't think I had it?"

"Sure I did. But the killer instinct is dead in fighters today and it
has to be ignited. It needs a trigger, so that was what I gave you--a
trigger."

Frankie understood. "You wanted me to get mad!"

"To do it, you had to get mad--at me. You're not conditioned to get mad
at Nappy or Pop. It's not the way we fight now. It had to be me. I had
to make you hate me."

Frankie marveled. "So when Pop looked at you--"

"He knew."

Frankie was off the table, his arms around Milt. "I'm--I'm so ashamed."

Milt grinned. "No, you're not. You're happier than you ever were in your
life. You're a real champion. Great feeling, isn't it? Now you know how
_they_ felt--in the old days."

Frankie was crying. "You are damn right! Thanks."

Milt looked years younger. "Don't mention it--_champ_."
