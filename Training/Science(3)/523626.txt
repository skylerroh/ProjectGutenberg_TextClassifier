facets immediately below the table and those of the cross facets
immediately above the girdle form four "templets," or "bezils." We thus
have above the girdle, thirty-three facets: 8 cross, 8 skill, 4 quoin, 8
star, 1 table, and 4 templets.

Reversing the stone and again commencing at the girdle, we have eight
"skill facets," sometimes called the lower skill facets, the bases of
which are on the girdle, their outer sides forming the bases of eight
cross facets, the apexes of which meet on the extremities of the
horizontal line, as in those above the girdle. If the basal lines of
these cross facets, where they join the sides of the skill facets, are
extended to the peak, or narrow end of the stone, these lines, together
with the sides of the cross facets, will form four five-sided facets,
called the "pavilions"; the spaces between these four pavilions have
their ends nearest the girdle formed by the inner sides of the skill
facets, and of these spaces, there will, of course, be four, which also
are five-sided figures, and are called "quoins," so that there are eight
five-sided facets--four large and four narrow--their bases forming a
square, with a small portion of each corner cut away; the bases of the
broader pavilions form the four sides, whilst the bases of the four
narrower quoins cut off the corners of the square, and this flat
portion, bounded by the eight bases, is called the "culet," but more
commonly "collet." So that below the girdle, we find twenty-five facets:
8 cross, 8 skill, 4 pavilion, 4 quoin, and 1 collet.

These, with the 33 of the crown, make 58, which is the usual number of
facets in a brilliant, though this varies with the character, quality,
and size of the diamond. For instance, though this number is considered
the best for normal stones, specially large ones often have more,
otherwise there is danger of their appearing dull, and it requires a
vast amount of skill and experience to decide upon the particular number
and size of the facets that will best display the fire and brilliance of
a large stone, for it is obvious that if, after months of cutting and
polishing, it is found that a greater or smaller number of facets ought
to have been allowed, the error cannot be retrieved without considerable
loss, and probable ruin to the stone. In the case of the Cullinan
diamonds, the two largest of which are called the Stars of Africa, 74
facets were cut in the largest portion, while in the next largest the
experts decided to make 66, and, as already pointed out, these stones
are, up to the present time, the most magnificent in fire, beauty and
purity ever discovered.

The positions and angles of the facets, as well as the number, are of
supreme importance, and diamond cutters--even though they have rules
regulating these matters, according to the weight and size of the
stone--must exercise the greatest care and exactitude, for their
decision once made is practically unalterable.




CHAPTER XII.

IMITATIONS, AND SOME OF THE TESTS, OF PRECIOUS STONES.


We now arrive at the point where it is necessary to discuss the
manufacture and re-formation of precious stones, and also to consider a
few of the tests which may be applied to _all_ stones. These are given
here in order to save needless repetition; the tests which are specially
applicable to individual stones will more properly be found under the
description of the stone referred to, so that the present chapter will
be devoted chiefly to generalities.

With regard to diamonds, the manufacture of these has not as yet been
very successful. As will be seen on reference to Chapter II., on "the
Origin of Precious Stones," it is generally admitted that these
beautiful and valuable minerals are caused by chemically-charged water
and occasionally, though not always, high temperature, but invariably
beautified and brought to the condition in which they are obtained by
the action of weight and pressure, extending unbroken through perhaps
ages of time.

In these circumstances, science, though able to give chemical
properties and pressure, cannot, of course, maintain these continuously
for "ages," therefore the chemist must manufacture the jewels in such
manner that he may soon see the results of his labours, and though real
diamonds may be made, and with comparative ease, from boron in the
amorphous or pure state along with aluminium, fused in a crucible at a
high temperature, these diamonds are but microscopic, nor can a number
of them be fused, or in any other way converted into a large single
stone, so that imitation stones, to be of any service must be made of a
good clear glass. The glass for this purpose is usually composed of
53.70 per cent. of red lead, 38.48 per cent. of pure quartz in fine
powder, preferably water-ground, and 7.82 per cent. of carbonate of
potash, the whole coloured when necessary with metallic oxides of a
similar nature to the constituents of the natural stones imitated. But
for colourless diamonds, the glass requires no such addition to tint it.
From the formula given is made the material known as "strass," or
"paste," and stones made of it are mostly exhibited under and amongst
brilliant artificial lights. The mere fact that they are sold cheaply is
_prima facie_ proof that the stones are glass, for it is evident that a
diamond, the commercial value of which might be L50 or more, cannot be
purchased for a few shillings and be genuine. So long as this is
understood and the stone is sold for the few shillings, no harm is done;
but to offer it as a genuine stone and at the price of a genuine stone,
would amount to fraud, and be punishable accordingly. Some of these
"paste," or "white stones," as they are called in the trade, are cut and
polished exactly like a diamond, and with such success as occasionally
to deceive all but experts. Such imitations are costly, though, of
course, not approaching the value of the real stones; it being no
uncommon thing for valuable jewels to be duplicated in paste, whilst the
originals are kept in the strong room of a bank or safe-deposit.

In all cases, however, a hard file will abrade the surface of the false
stone. In chapter VII. we found that quartz is in the seventh degree of
hardness, and an ordinary file is but a shade harder than this, so that
almost all stones higher than No. 7 are unaffected by a file unless it
is used roughly, so as to break a sharp edge. In order to prepare
artificial diamonds and other stones for the file and various tests,
they are often what is called "converted" into "doublets" or "triplets."
These are made as follows: the body of the glass is of paste, and on the
"table" (see last chapter), and perhaps on the broader facets, there
will be placed a very thin slab of the real stone, attached by cement.
In the case of the diamond, the body is clear, but in the coloured
imitations the paste portion is made somewhat lighter in shade than the
real stone would be, the portion below the girdle being coloured
chemically, or mounted in a coloured backing. Such a stone will, of
course, stand most tests, for the parts usually tested are genuine.

A stone of this nature is called a "doublet," and it is evident that
when it is tested on the underside, it will prove too soft, therefore
the "triplet" has been introduced. This is exactly on the lines of the
doublet, except that the collet and perhaps the pavilions are covered
also, so that the girdle, which is generally encased by the mounting,
is the only surface-portion of paste. In other cases the whole of the
crown is genuine, whilst often both the upper and lower portions are
solid and genuine, the saving being effected by using a paste centre at
the girdle, covered by the mounting. Such a stone as this last mentioned
is often difficult to detect without using severe tests and desperate
means, e.g.:--(a) by its crystalline structure (see Chapter III.);
(b) by the cleavage planes (see Chapter IV.); (c) by the polariscope
(see Chapter V.); (d) by the dichroscope (see Chapter VI.); (e) by
specific gravity (see Chapter VIII.); (f) cutting off the mounting,
and examining the girdle; (g) soaking the stone for a minute or so in
a mixture said to have been originally discovered by M. D. Rothschild,
and composed of hydrofluoric acid and ammonia; this will not answer for
all stones, but is safe to use for the diamond and a few others. Should
the jewel be glass, it will be etched, if not completely destroyed, but
if genuine, no change will be apparent; (h) soaking the diamond for a
few minutes in warm or cold water, in alcohol, in chloroform, or in all
these in turn, when, if a doublet, or triplet, it will tumble to pieces
where joined together by the cement, which will have been dissolved. It
is, however, seldom necessary to test so far, for an examination under
the microscope, even with low power, is usually sufficient to detect in
the glass the air-bubbles which are almost inseparable from
glass-mixtures, though they do not detract from the physical properties
of the glass. The higher powers of the same instrument will almost
always define the junction and the layer or layers of cement, no matter
how delicate a film may have been used. Any one of these tests is
sufficient to isolate a false stone.

Some of the softer genuine stones may be fused together with splinters,
dust, and cuttings of the same stones, and of this product is formed a
larger stone, which, though manufactured, is essentially perfectly real,
possessing exactly the same properties as a naturally formed stone. Many
such stones are obtained as large as an ordinary pin's head, and are
much used commercially for cluster-work in rings, brooches, for
watch-jewels, scarf-pins, and the like, and are capable of being cut and
polished exactly like an original stone. This is a means of using up to
great advantage the lapidary's dust, and though these products are real
stones, perhaps a little more enriched in colour chemically, they are
much cheaper than a natural stone of the same size and weight.

Some spurious stones have their colour improved by heat, by being tinged
on the outside, by being tinted throughout with a fixed colour and
placed in a clear setting; others, again, have a setting of a different
hue, so that the reflection of this shall give additional colour and
fire to the stone. For instance, glass diamonds are often set with the
whole of the portion below the girdle hidden, this part of the stone
being silvered like a mirror. Others are set open, being held at the
girdle only, the portion covered by the setting being silvered. Other
glass imitations, such as the opal, have a tolerably good representation
of the "fiery" opal given to them by the admixture, in the glass, of a
little oxide of tin, which makes it somewhat opalescent, and in the
setting is placed a backing of red, gold, copper, or fiery-coloured
tinsel, whilst the glass itself, at the back, is painted very thinly
with a paint composed of well washed and dried fish-scales, reduced to
an impalpable powder, mixed with a little pure, refined mastic, or other
colourless varnish. This gives a good imitation of phosphorescence, as
well as a slight pearliness, whilst the tinsel, seen through the paint
and the curious milkiness of the glass, gives good "fire."

A knowledge of the colours natural to precious stones and to jewels
generally is of great service in their rough classification for testing,
even though some stones are found in a variety of colours. An
alphabetical list of the most useful is here appended, together with
their average specific gravities and hardness. (See also Chapter VII. on
"Hardness," and Chapter VIII. on "Specific Gravity.")

VARIOUS PRECIOUS STONES.


_The Diamond._

To recapitulate certain of the facts respecting the diamond.--This
wonderful gem has the distinction amongst precious stones of being
unique; though many are composed of two, three, or but a small number of
elements, the diamond is the only stone known consisting of one element,
and absolutely nothing else--pure crystallised carbon. Its hardness is
proverbial; not only is it untouched by the action of a hard file, but
it occasionally refuses to split when struck with finely tempered steel,
which it often causes to break. Such was the case with the South African
diamond, for when the knife that was to break it was struck smartly with
a steel bar, the first blow broke the blade without affecting the
diamond, yet a piece of bort, or diamond dust, splinters, or defective
diamonds (all these being called bort), may readily be pulverised in a
hard steel mortar with a hard steel pestle.

The diamond is the hardest stone known; it is also the only stone known
which is really combustible. It is of true adamantine lustre, classed by
experts as midway between the truly metallic and the purely resinous. In
refractive power and dispersion of the coloured rays of light, called
its fire, it stands pre-eminent. It possesses a considerable variety of
colour; that regarded as the most perfect and rare is the blue-white
colour. Most commonly, however, the colours are clear, with steely-blue
casts, pale and neutral-colour yellow, whilst amongst the most expensive
and rare are those of green, pale pink, red, and any other variety with
strong and decided colour. Although these stones are sold by the carat,
there can be no hard and fast rule laid down as to the value of a carat,
for this depends on the size, quality, and the purity of the stone. The
larger the stone the greater the value per carat, and prices have been
known to range from 25_l._ per carat for a small stone to 500_l._ per
carat for a large one, whereas the exceptionally large stones possess a
value almost beyond estimation.

It often happens that some stones--particularly those from South Africa
and Brazil--are tinted when uncut, probably by reason of the action upon
them of their matrix, especially if ironstone, or with rolling for ages
