Buckram. 6s._

'Mr. Baring Gould has done a good deed, and is deserving of gratitude,
in re-writing in honest, simple style the old stories that delighted
the childhood of "our fathers and grandfathers." We do not think
he has omitted any of our favourite stories, the stories that are
commonly regarded as merely "old fashioned." As to the form of the
book, and the printing, which is by Messrs. Constable, it were
difficult to commend overmuch.'--_Saturday Review_.

Lines. With numerous Illustrations from Busts, Gems, Cameos, etc. By
S. BARING GOULD, Author of 'Mehalah,' etc. _Third Edition. Royal 8vo.
15s._

'A most splendid and fascinating book on a subject of undying
interest. The great feature of the book is the use the author has made
of the existing portraits of the Caesars, and the admirable critical
subtlety he has exhibited in dealing with this line of research. It is
brilliantly written, and the illustrations are supplied on a scale of
profuse magnificence.'--_Daily Chronicle_.

'The volumes will in no sense disappoint the general reader. Indeed,
in their way, there is nothing in any sense so good in English.... Mr.
Baring Gould has presented his narrative in such a way as not to make
one dull page.'--_Athenaeum_.

interest, relics of cave-dwellers, of mediaeval robbers, and of the
English domination and the Hundred Years' War.

'His two richly-illustrated volumes are full of matter of interest
to the geologist, the archaeologist, and the student of history and
manners.'--_Scotsman_.

'It deals with its subject in a manner which rarely fails to arrest
attention.'--_Times_.

SIX SHILLING NOVELS


MARIE CORELLI. BARABBAS: A DREAM OF THE WORLD'S TRAGEDY. By MARIE
CORELLI, Author of 'A Romance of Two Worlds,' 'Vendetta,' etc.
_Seventeenth Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

'The tender reverence of the treatment and the imaginative beauty of
the writing have reconciled us to the daring of the conception, and
the conviction is forced on us that even so exalted a subject cannot
be made too familiar to us, provided it be presented in the true
spirit of Christian faith. The amplifications of the Scripture
narrative are often conceived with high poetic insight, and
this "Dream of the World's Tragedy" is, despite some trifling
incongruities, a lofty and not inadequate paraphrase of the supreme
climax of the inspired narrative.'--_Dublin Review_.


ANTHONY HOPE. THE GOD IN THE CAR. By ANTHONY HOPE, Author of 'A Change
of Air,' etc. _Sixth Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

'Ruston is drawn with extraordinary skill, and Maggie Dennison with
many subtle strokes. The minor characters are clear cut. In short
the book is a brilliant one. "The God in the Car" is one of the most
remarkable works in a year that has given us the handiwork of nearly
all our best living novelists.'--_Standard_.

'A very remarkable book, deserving of critical analysis impossible
within our limit; brilliant, but not superficial; well considered, but
not elaborated; constructed with the proverbial art that conceals,
but yet allows itself to be enjoyed by readers to whom fine literary
method is a keen pleasure; true without cynicism, subtle without
affectation, humorous without strain, witty without offence,
inevitably sad, with an unmorose simplicity.'--_The World_.


ANTHONY HOPE. A CHANGE OF AIR. By ANTHONY HOPE, Author of 'The
Prisoner of Zenda,' etc. _Second Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

'A graceful, vivacious comedy, true to human nature. The characters
are traced with a masterly hand.'--_Times_.


ANTHONY HOPE. A MAN OF MARK. By ANTHONY HOPE, Author of 'The Prisoner
of Zenda,' 'The God in the Car,' etc. _Second Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

'A bright, entertaining, unusually able book, quite worthy of its
brilliant author.'--_Queen_.

'Of all Mr. Hope's books, "A Man of Mark" is the one which best
compares with "The Prisoner of Zenda." The two romances are
unmistakably the work of the same writer, and he possesses a style
of narrative peculiarly seductive, piquant, comprehensive, and--his
own.'--_National Observer_.


CONAN DOYLE. ROUND THE RED LAMP. By A. CONAN DOYLE, Author of 'The
White Company,' 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,' etc. _Fourth
Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

'The book is, indeed, composed of leaves from life, and is far and
away the best view that has been vouchsafed us behind the scenes of
the consulting-room. It is very superior to "The Diary of a late
Physician."'--_Illustrated London News_.

'Dr. Doyle wields a cunning pen, as all the world now knows. His deft
touch is seen to perfection in these short sketches--these "facts and
fancies of medical life," as he calls them. Every page reveals the
literary artist, the keen observer, the trained delineator of human
nature, its weal and its woe.'--_Freeman's Journal_.

'These tales are skilful, attractive, and eminently suited to give
relief to the mind of a reader in quest of distraction.'--_Athenaeum_.


STANLEY WEYMAN. UNDER THE RED ROBE. By STANLEY WEYMAN, Author of 'A
Gentleman of France.' With Twelve Illustrations by R. Caton Woodville.
_Seventh Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

A cheaper edition of a book which won instant popularity. No
unfavourable review occurred, and most critics spoke in terms of
enthusiastic admiration. The 'Westminster Gazette' called it '_a book
of which we have read every word for the sheer pleasure of reading,
and which we put down with a pang that we cannot forget it all and
start again_.' The 'Daily Chronicle' said that '_every one who reads
books at all must read this thrilling romance, from the first page
of which to the last the breathless reader is haled along_.' It also
called the book '_an inspiration of manliness and courage_.' The
'Globe' called it '_a delightful tale of chivalry and adventure,
vivid and dramatic, with a wholesome modesty and reverence for the
highest_.'


EMILY LAWLESS. MAELCHO: a Sixteenth Century Romance. By the Hon. EMILY
LAWLESS, Author of 'Grania,' 'Hurrish,' etc. _Second Edition. Crown
8vo. 6s._

'A striking and delightful book. A task something akin to Scott's
may lie before Miss Lawless. If she carries forward this series of
historical pictures with the same brilliancy and truth she has already
shown, and with the increasing self-control one may expect from
the genuine artist, she may do more for her country than many a
politician. Throughout this fascinating book, Miss Lawless has
produced something which is not strictly history and is not strictly
fiction, but nevertheless possesses both imaginative value and
historical insight in a high degree.'--_Times_.

'A really great book.'--_Spectator_.

'There is no keener pleasure in life than the recognition of genius.
Good work is commoner than it used to be, but the best is as rare as
ever. All the more gladly, therefore, do we welcome in "Maelcho" a
piece of work of the first order, which we do not hesitate to
describe as one of the most remarkable literary achievements of
this generation. Miss Lawless is possessed of the very essence of
historical genius.'--_Manchester Guardian_.


E.F. BENSON. DODO: A DETAIL OF THE DAY. By E.F. BENSON. _Crown 8vo.
Sixteenth Edition, 6s._

A story of society which attracted by its brilliance universal
attention. The best critics were cordial in their praise. The
'Guardian' spoke of 'Dodo' as '_unusually clever and interesting_';
the 'Spectator' called it '_a delightfully witty sketch of society_;'
the 'Speaker' said the dialogue was '_a perpetual feast of epigram and
paradox_'; the 'Athenaeum' spoke of the author as '_a writer of
quite exceptional ability_'; the 'Academy' praised his '_amazing
cleverness_;' the 'World' said the book was '_brilliantly written_';
and half-a-dozen papers declared there was '_not a dull page in the
book_.'


E.F. BENSON. THE RUBICON. By E.F. BENSON, Author of 'Dodo.' _Fourth
Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._
