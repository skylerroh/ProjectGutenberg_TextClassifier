the emotion that had carried him so far, and relaxing into the simple
physical routine of keeping both himself and Ch'ien afloat.

By the time the submarine surfaced a dozen yards away, Spencer Candron
was both physically and mentally exhausted. He yelled at the top of his
lungs, and then held on to consciousness just long enough to be rescued.

       *       *       *       *       *

"The official story," said Senator Kerotski, "is that an impostor had
taken Dr. Ch'ien's place before he ever left the United States--" He
grinned. "At least, the substitution took place before the delegates
reached China. So the 'assassination' was really no assassination at
all. Ch'ien was kidnaped here, and a double put in his place in Peiping.
That absolves both us and the Chinese Government of any complicity. We
save face for them, and they save face for us. Since he turned up here,
in the States, it's obvious that he couldn't have been in China." He
chuckled, but there was no mirth in it. "So the cold war still
continues. We know what they did, and--in a way--they know what we did.
But not how we did it."

The senator looked at the other two men who were with him on the fifth
floor office of the _Society for Mystical and Metaphysical Research_.
Taggert was relaxing on his couch, and Spencer Candron, just out of the
hospital, looked rather pale as he sat in the big, soft chair that
Taggert had provided.

The senator looked at Candron. "The thing I don't understand is, why was
it necessary to knock out Ch'ien? He'll have a sore jaw for weeks. Why
didn't you just tell him who you were and what you were up to?"

Candron glanced at Taggert, but Taggert just grinned and nodded.

"We couldn't allow that," said Candron, looking at Senator Kerotski.
"Dr. James Ch'ien has too much of a logical, scientific mind for that.
We'd have ruined him if he'd seen me in action."

The senator looked a little surprised. "Why? We've convinced other
scientists that they were mistaken in their observations. Why not
Ch'ien?"

"Ch'ien is too good a scientist," Candron said. "He's not the type who
would refuse to believe something he saw simply because it didn't agree
with his theories. Ch'ien is one of those dangerous in-betweens. He's
too brilliant to be allowed to go to waste, and, at the same time, too
rigid to change his manner of thinking. If he had seen me teleport or
levitate, he wouldn't reject it--he'd try to explain it. And that would
have effectively ruined him."

"Ruined him?" The senator looked a little puzzled.

Taggert raised his heavy head from the couch. "Sure, Leo," he said to
the senator. "Don't you see? We _need_ Ch'ien on this interstellar
project. He absolutely _must_ dope out the answer somehow, and no one
else can do it as quickly."

"With the previous information," the senator said, "we would have been
able to continue."

"Yeah?" Taggert said, sitting up. "Has anyone been able to dope out
Fermat's Last Theorem without Fermat? No. So why ruin Ch'ien?"

"It would ruin him," Candron broke in, before the senator could speak.
"If he saw, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that levitation and
teleportation were possible, he would have accepted his own senses as
usable data on definite phenomena. But, limited as he is by his
scientific outlook, he would have tried to evolve a scientific theory to
explain what he saw. What else could a scientist _do_?"

Senator Kerotski nodded, and his nod said: "I see. He would have
diverted his attention from the field of the interstellar drive to the
field of psionics. And he would have wasted years trying to explain an
inherently nonlogical area of knowledge by logical means."

"That's right," Candron said. "We would have set him off on a wild goose
chase, trying to solve the problems of psionics by the scientific, the
logical, method. We would have presented him with an unsolvable
problem."

Taggert patted his knees. "We would have given him a problem that he
could not solve with the methodology at hand. It would be as though we
had proved to an ancient Greek philosopher that the cube _could_ be
doubled, and then allowed him to waste his life trying to do it with a
straight-edge and compass."

"We know Ch'ien's psychological pattern," Candron continued. "He's not
capable of admitting that there is any other thought pattern than the
logical. He would try to solve the problems of psionics by logical
methods, and would waste the rest of his life trying to do the
impossible."

The senator stroked his chin. "That's clear," he said at last. "Well, it
was worth a cracked jaw to save him. We've given him a perfectly logical
explanation of his rescue and, simultaneously, we've put the Chinese
government into absolute confusion. They have no idea of how you got out
of there, Candron."

"That's not as important as saving Ch'ien," Candron said.

"No," the senator said quickly, "of course not. After all, the Secretary
of Research needs Dr. Ch'ien--the man's important."

Spencer Candron smiled. "I agree. He's practically indispensable--as
much as a man can be."

"He's the Secretary's right hand man," said Taggert firmly.
