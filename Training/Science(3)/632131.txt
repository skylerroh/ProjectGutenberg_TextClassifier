
"That's not my specialty, you know," the Chief answered cautiously.

"Some of those radiations started out from their home planet a million
_light_ years ago," Pringle said quietly.

"So what again?" the Chief asked.

"Those radiations," Kenzie said, "happen to be communications between
the galaxies--beamed at the ants. Sort of a continuous radio program
broadcast universe wide. It happens the ants, maybe termites, maybe
other insects, are spread through all the galaxies. It happens _they_
are the dominant intelligent race throughout the universe." He
shrugged in disgust.

"Us big brave humans," he said contemptuously. "Someday we might even
reach Mars. Hell, those ants have been colonizing for hundreds of
millions of years. They're still communicating. They are the real
intelligence on the earth!"

He crushed a cigarette fiercely into a glass ash tray on the desk.

"Only thing man has got, or ever had, was his ego. He's got to believe
he's top dog, or else he folds and quits. Yeah, we're smart all right.
Hell, we're so far down the scale the ants don't even recognize us as
a life form at all."

Pringle nodded soberly. "Yeah," he said to the Chief, "how would you
like to explain a gadget that proved ants have more brains than you
have?"

The Chief looked at them with incredulous eyes.

He was still staring at them silently, with a bloodless face, when the
office messenger came in and told him the General Manager wished to
see him in his office to discuss budgets.

I closed the back office door quietly and went back to work. The other
guys clustered around and wanted to know what I heard.

"Nothing," I said, and looked them straight in the eye. "Nothing at
all."
