hardly perceptible.

There were more burnings. Back on Earth there were careful measurements.
A tight beam tends to attenuate when it is thrown a hundred thousand
miles. It tends to! When speech is conducted over it, the lag between
comment and reply is perceptible. It's not great--just over half a
second. But one notices it. That lag was used to measure the speed and
distance of the two craft. The prospect didn't look too good.

The space tug burned rocket after rocket after rocket. There was no
effect that Joe could detect, of course. It would have been like
noticing the effect of single oar-strokes in a rowboat miles from shore.
But the instruments on Earth found a difference. They made very, very,
very careful computations. And the electronic brains did the
calculations which battalions of mathematicians would have needed years
to work out. The electronic calculations which could not make a mistake
said--that it was a toss-up.

The Moon came slowly to float before the two linked ships. It grew
slowly, slowly larger. The word from Earth was that considering the
rockets still available in the space tug, and those that should have
been fired but weren't on the Moonship, there must be no more blasts
just yet. The two ships must pass together through the neutral-point
where the gravities of Earth and Moon exactly cancel out. They must fall
together toward the Moon. Forty miles above the lunar surface
such-and-such rockets were to be fired. At twenty miles, such-and-such
others. At five miles the Moonship itself must fire its remaining
fuel-store. With luck, it was a toss-up. Safety or a smash.

But there was a long time to wait. Joe and his crew relaxed in the space
tug. The Chief looked out a port and observed:

"I can see the ring-mountains now. Naked-eye stuff, too! I wonder if
anybody ever saw that before!"

"Not likely," said Joe.

Mike stared out a port. Haney looked, also.

"How're we going to get back, Joe?"

"The Moonship has rockets on board," Joe told him. "Only they can't
stick them in the firing-racks outside. They're stowed away, all
shipshape, Navy fashion. After we land, we'll ask politely for rockets
to get back to the Platform with. It'll be a tedious run. Mostly
coasting--falling free. But we'll make it."

"If everything doesn't blow when we land," said the Chief.

Joe said uncomfortably: "It won't. Not that somebody won't try." Then he
stopped. After a moment he said awkwardly: "Look! It's necessary that we
humans get to the stars, or ultimately we'll crowd the Earth until we
won't be able to stay human. We'd have to have wars and plagues and such
things to keep our numbers down. It--it seems to me, and I--think it's
been said before, that it looks like there's something, somewhere,
that's afraid of us humans. It doesn't want us to reach the stars. It
didn't want us to fly. Before that it didn't want us to learn how to
cure disease, or have steam, or--anything that makes men different from
the beasts."

Haney turned his head. He listened intently.

"Maybe it sounds--superstitious," said Joe uneasily, "but there's always
been somebody trying to smash everything the rest of us wanted. As
if--as if something alien and hateful went around whispering
hypnotically into men's ears while they slept, commanding them
irresistibly to do things to smash all their own hopes."

The Chief grunted. "Huh! D'you think that's new stuff, Joe?"

"N-no," admitted Joe. "But it's true. Something fights us. You can make
wild guesses. Maybe--things on far planets that know that if ever we
reach there.... There's something that hates men and it tries to make us
destroy ourselves."

"Sure," said Haney mildly. "I learned about that in Sunday School, Joe."

"Maybe I mean that," said Joe helplessly. "But anyhow there's something
we fight--and there's Something that fights with us. So I think we're
going to get the Moonship down all right."

Mike said sharply: "You mean you think this is all worked out in
advance. That we'd be here, we'd get here----"

The Chief said impatiently, "It's figured out so we can do it if we got
the innards. We got the chance. We can duck it. But if we duck it, it's
bad, and somebody else has to have the chance later. I know what Joe's
saying. Us men, we got to get to the stars. There's millions of 'em, and
we need the planets they've got swimming around 'em."

Haney said, "Some of them have planets. That's known. Yeah."

"Those planets ain't going to go on forever with nobody using 'em,"
grunted the Chief. "It don't make sense. And things in general do make
sense. All but us humans," he finished with a grin. "And I like us,
anyhow. Joe's right. We'll get by this time. And if we don't--some other
guys'll have to do the job of landing on the Moon. But it'll be
done--as a starter."

"I can see lots of mountains down there. Plain," Mike said quietly.

"What's the radar say?"

Joe looked. Back at the Platform it had shown the curve of the surface
of Earth. Here a dim line was beginning to show on the vertical-plane
screen. It was the curve of the surface of the Moon.

"We might as well get set," said Joe. "We've got time but we might as
well. Space suits on. I'll tighten up the chain. Steering rockets'll do
that. Then we'll take a last look. All firing racks loaded outside?"

"Yeah," said Haney. He grinned wrily. "You know, Joe, I know what I
know, but still I'm scared."

"Me, too," said Joe.

But there were things to do. They took their places. They watched out
the ports. The Moon had seemed a vast round ball a little while back.
Now it appeared to be flattening. Its edges still curved away beyond a
surprisingly nearby horizon. The ring-mountains were amazingly distinct.
There were incredibly wide, smooth spaces with mottled colorings. But
the mountains....

When the ships were 40 miles high the space tug blasted valorously, and
all the panorama of the Moon's surface was momentarily hidden by the
racing clouds of mist. The rockets burned out.

Haney and the Chief replaced the burned-out rockets. They were gigantic,
heavy-bore tubes which they couldn't have stirred on Earth. Now they
loaded them into the curious locks which conveyed them outside the hull
into firing position.

The ring-mountains were gigantic when they blasted again! They were only
20 miles up, then, and some of the peaks rose four miles from their
inner crater floors.

The ships were still descending fast. Joe spoke into his microphone.

"Calling Moonship! Calling----" He stopped and said matter-of-factly,
"I suggest we fire our last blast together. Shall I give the word?
Right!"

The surface of the Moon came toward them. Craters, cracks, frozen
fountains of stone, swelling undulations of ground interrupted without
rhyme or reason by the gigantic splashings of missiles from the sky a
hundred thousand million years ago. The colorings were unbelievable.
There were reds and browns and yellows. There were grays and dusty
deep-blues and streaks of completely impossible tints in combination.

But Joe couldn't watch that. He kept his eyes on a very special gadget
which was a radar range-finder. He hadn't used it about the Platform
because there were too many tin cans and such trivia floating about. It
wouldn't be dependable. But it did measure the exact distance to the
nearest solid object.

"Prepare for firing on a count of five," said Joe quietly. "Five ...
four ... three ... two ... one ... fire!"

The space tug's rockets blasted. For the first time since they overtook
the Moonship, the tug now had help. The remaining rockets outside the
Moonship's hull blasted furiously. Out the ports there was nothing but
hurtling whitenesses. The rockets droned and rumbled and roared....

The main rockets burned out. The steering rockets still boomed. Joe had
thrown them on for what good their lift might do.

"Joe!" said Haney in a surprised tone. "I feel weight! Not much, but
some! And the main rockets are off!"

Joe nodded. He watched the instruments before him. He shifted a control,
and the space tug swayed. It swayed over to the limit of the tow-chain
it had fastened to the Moonship. Joe shifted his controls again.

There was a peculiar, gritty contact somewhere. Joe cut the steering
rockets and it was possible to look out. There were more gritty noises.
The space tug settled a little and leaned a little. It was still. Then
there was no noise at all.

"Yes," said Joe. "We've got some weight. We're on the Moon."

They went out of the ship in a peculiarly solemn procession. About them
reared cliffs such as no man had ever looked on before save in dreams.
Above their heads hung a huge round greenish globe, with a white polar
ice-cap plainly visible. It hung in mid-sky and was four times the size
of the Moon as seen from Earth. If one stood still and looked at it, it
would undoubtedly be seen to be revolving, once in some twenty-four
hours.

Mike scuffled in the dust in which he walked. Nobody had emerged from
the Moonship yet. The four of them were literally the first human beings
ever to set foot on the surface of the Moon. But none of them mentioned
the fact, though all were acutely aware of it. Mike kicked up dust. It
rose in a curiously liquid-like fashion. There was no air to scatter it.
It settled deliberately back again.

Mike spoke with an odd constraint. "No green cheese," he said absurdly.

"No," agreed Joe. "Let's go over to the Moonship. It looks all right. It
couldn't have landed hard."

They went toward the bulk of the ship from Earth, which now was a base
for the military occupation of a globe with more land-area than all
Earth's continents put together--but not a drop of water. The Moonship
was tilted slightly askew, but it was patently unharmed. There were
faces at every port in the hull.

The Chief stopped suddenly. A sizable boulder rose from the dust. The
Chief struck it smartly with his space-gloved hand.

"I'm counting coup on the Moon!" he said zestfully "Tie that, you guys!"

Then he joined the others on their way to the Moonship's main lock.

"Shall we knock?" asked Mike humorously. "I doubt they've got a
door-bell!"

But the lock-door was opening to admit them. They crowded inside.

Commander Brown was waiting for them with an out-stretched hand. "Glad
to have you aboard." And there was a genuine smile creeping across his
face.

       *       *       *       *       *

Joe talked with careful distinctness into a microphone. His voice took a
little over a second to reach its destination. Then there was a pause of
the same length before the first syllable of Sally's reply came to him
from Earth.

"I've reported to your father," said Joe carefully, "and the Moonship
has reported to the Navy. In a couple of hours Haney and the Chief and
Mike and I will be taking off to go back to the Platform. We got rockets
from the stores of the Moonship."

Sally's voice was surprisingly clear. It wavered a little, but there was
no sound of static to mar reception.

"Then what, Joe?"

"I'm bringing written reports and photographs and first specimens of
geology from the Moon," Joe told her. "I'm a mailman. It'll probably be
sixty hours back to the Platform--free fall most of the way--and then
we'll refuel and I'll come down to Earth to deliver the reports and
such."

Pause. One second and a little for his voice to go. Another second and
something over for her voice to return.

"And then?"

"That's what I'm trying to find out," said Joe. "What day is today?"

"Tuesday," said Sally after the inevitable pause. "It's ten o'clock
Tuesday morning at the Shed."

Joe made calculations in his mind. Then he said:

"I ought to land on Earth some time next Monday."

Pause.

"Yes?" said Sally.

"I wondered," said Joe. "How about a date that night?" Another pause.
Then Sally's voice. She sounded glad.

"It's a date, Joe. And--do you know, I must be the first girl in the
world to make a date with the Man in the Moon?"




     COMBAT MISSION!


     _Joe Kenmore's mission was as dangerous as it sounded simple:_

         "DELIVER SUPPLIES AND ATOMIC WEAPONS TO THE SPACE PLATFORM.
         THEN PREPARE FOR MAN'S FIRST EXPEDITION TO THE MOON."

    Joe had helped launch the first Space Platform--that initial rung in
    man's ladder to the stars. But the enemies who had ruthlessly tried
    to destroy the space station before it left Earth were still at
    work. They were plotting to stop Joe's mission!
