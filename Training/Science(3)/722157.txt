amounts to 8.

If, finally, the spectral type of the near stars is considered, we find
from the last column of the table that these stars are distributed in
the following way:--

    Spectral type   B A F G K M
    Number          0 2 2 5 9 3.

For two of the stars the spectrum is for the present unknown.

We find that the number of stars increases with the spectral index. The
unknown stars in the siriometer sphere belong probably, in the main, to
the red types.

If we now seek to form a conception of the _total_ number in this sphere
we may proceed in different ways. EDDINGTON, in his "Stellar movements",
to which I refer the reader, has used the proper motions as a scale of
calculation, and has found that we may expect to find in all 32 stars in
this sphere, confining ourselves to stars apparently brighter than the
magnitude 9m.5. This makes 8 stars per cub. sir.

We may attack the problem in other ways. A very rough method which,
however, is not without importance, is the following. Let us suppose
that the Galaxy in the direction of the Milky Way has an extension of
1000 siriometers and in the direction of the poles of the Milky Way an
extension of 50 sir. We have later to return to the fuller discussion of
this extension. For the present it is sufficient to assume these values.
The whole system of the Galaxy then has a volume of 200 million cubic
siriometers. Suppose further that the total number of stars in the
Galaxy would amount to 1000 millions, a value to which we shall also
return in a following chapter. Then we conclude that the average number
of stars per cubic siriometer would amount to 5. This supposes that the
density of the stars in each part of the Galaxy is the same. But the sun
lies rather near the centre of the system, where the density is
(considerably) greater than the average density. A calculation, which
will be found in the mathematical part of these lectures, shows that the
density in the centre amounts to approximately 16 times the average
density, giving 80 stars per cubic siriometer in the neighbourhood of
the sun (and of the centre). A sphere having a radius of one siriometer
has a volume of 4 cubic siriometers, so that we obtain in this way 320
stars in all, within a sphere with a radius of one siriometer. For
different reasons it is probable that this number is rather too great
than too small, and we may perhaps estimate the total number to be
something like 200 stars, of which more than a tenth is now known to the
astronomers.

We may also arrive at an evaluation of this number by proceeding from
the number of stars of different apparent or absolute magnitudes. This
latter way is the most simple. We shall find in a later paragraph that
the absolute magnitudes which are now known differ between -8 and +13.
But from mathematical statistics it is proved that the total range of a
statistical series amounts upon an average to approximately 6 times the
dispersion of the series. Hence we conclude that the dispersion
([sigma]) of the absolute magnitudes of the stars has approximately the
value 3 (we should obtain [sigma] = [13 + 8] : 6 = 3.5, but for large
numbers of individuals the total range may amount to more than 6
[sigma]).

As, further, the number of stars per cubic siriometer with an absolute
magnitude brighter than 6 is known (we have obtained 8 : 4 = 2 stars per
cubic siriometer brighter than 6m), we get a relation between the total
number of stars per cubic siriometer (_D_0_) and the mean absolute
magnitude (_M_0_) of the stars, so that _D_0_ can be obtained, as soon
as _M_0_ is known. The computation of _M_0_ is rather difficult, and is
discussed in a following chapter. Supposing, for the moment, _M_0_ = 10
we get for _D_0_ the value 22, corresponding to a number of 90 stars
within a distance of one siriometer from the sun. We should then know a
fifth part of these stars.


34. _Parallax stars._ In Sec.22 I have paid attention to the now available
catalogues of stars with known annual parallax. The most extensive of
these catalogues is that of WALKEY, containing measured parallaxes of
625 stars. For a great many of these stars the value of the parallax
measured must however be considered as rather uncertain, and I have
pointed out that only for such stars as have a parallax greater than
0".04 (or a distance smaller than 5 siriometers) may the measured
parallax be considered as reliable, as least generally speaking. The
effective number of parallax stars is therefore essentially reduced.
Indirectly it is nevertheless possible to get a relatively large
catalogue of parallax stars with the help of the ingenious spectroscopic
method of ADAMS, which permits us to determine the absolute magnitude,
and therefore also the distance, of even farther stars through an
examination of the relative intensity of certain lines in the stellar
spectra. It may be that the method is not yet as firmly based as it
should be,[15] but there is every reason to believe that the course
taken is the right one and that the catalogue published by ADAMS of 500
parallax stars in Contrib. from Mount Wilson, 142, already gives a more
complete material than the catalogues of directly measured parallaxes. I
give here a short resume of the attributes of the parallax stars in this
catalogue.

The catalogue of ADAMS embraces stars of the spectral types F, G, K and
M. In order to complete this material by parallaxes of blue stars I add
from the catalogue of WALKEY those stars in his catalogue that belong to
the spectral types B and A, confining myself to stars for which the
parallax may be considered as rather reliable. There are in all 61 such
stars, so that a sum of 561 stars with known distance is to be
discussed.

For all these stars we know _m_ and _M_ and for the great part of them
also the proper motion [mu]. We can therefore for each spectral type
compute the mean values and the dispersion of these attributes. We thus
get the following table, in which I confine myself to the mean values of
the attributes.


TABLE 6.

_MEAN VALUES OF _m_, _M_ AND THE PROPER MOTIONS ([mu]) OF PARALLAX STARS
OF DIFFERENT SPECTRAL TYPES._

+---+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|Sp.|Number |  _m_  |  _M_  | [mu]  |
+---+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| B |  15   | +2.03 | -1.67 | 0".05 |
| A |  46   | +3.40 | +0.64 | 0.21  |
| F | 125   | +5.60 | +2.10 | 0.40  |
| G | 179   | +5.77 | +1.68 | 0.51  |
| K | 184   | +6.17 | +2.31 | 0.53  |
| M |  42   | +6.02 | +2.30 | 0.82  |
+---+-------+-------+-------+-------+

We shall later consider all parallax stars taken together. We find from
table 6 that the apparent magnitude, as well as the absolute magnitude,
is approximately the same for all yellow and red stars and even for the
stars of type F, the apparent magnitude being approximately equal to +6m
and the absolute magnitude equal to +2m. For type B we find the mean
value of M to be -1m.7 and for type A we find M = +0m.6. The proper
motion also varies in the same way, being for F, G, K, M approximately
0".5 and for B and A 0".1. As to the mean values of _M_ and [mu] we
cannot draw distinct conclusions from this material, because the
parallax stars are selected in a certain way which essentially
influences these mean values, as will be more fully discussed below. The
most interesting conclusion to be drawn from the parallax stars is
obtained from their distribution over different values of _M_. In the
memoir referred to, ADAMS has obtained the following table (somewhat
differently arranged from the table of ADAMS),[16] which gives the
number of parallax stars for different values of the absolute magnitude
for different spectral types.

A glance at this table is sufficient to indicate a singular and well
pronounced property in these frequency distributions. We find, indeed,
that in the types G, K and M the frequency curves are evidently
resolvable into two simple curves of distribution. In all these types we
may distinguish between a bright group and a faint group. With a
terminology proposed by HERTZSPRUNG the former group is said to consist
of _giant_ stars, the latter group of _dwarf_ stars. Even in the stars
of type F this division may be suggested. This distinction is still more
pronounced in the graphical representation given in figures (plate IV).

In the distribution of all the parallax stars we once more find a
similar bipartition of the stars. Arguing from these statistics some
astronomers have put forward the theory that the stars in space are
divided into two classes, which are not in reality closely related. The
one class consists of intensely luminous stars and the other of feeble
stars, with little or no transition between the two classes. If the
parallax stars are arranged according to their apparent proper motion,
or even according to their absolute proper motion, a similar bipartition
is revealed in their frequency distribution.

Nevertheless the bipartition of the stars into two such distinct classes
must be considered as vague and doubtful. Such an _apparent_
bipartition is, indeed, necessary in all statistics as soon as
individuals are selected from a given population in such a manner as the
parallax stars are selected from the stars in space. Let us consider
three attributes, say _A_, _B_ and _C_, of the individuals of a
population and suppose that the attribute _C_ is _positively_ correlated
to the attributes _A_ and _B_, so that to great or small values of _A_
or _B_ correspond respectively great or small values of _C_. Now if the
individuals in the population are statistically selected in such a way
that we choose out individuals having great values of the attributes _A_
and small values of the attribute _B_, then we get a statistical series
regarding the attribute _C_, which consists of two seemingly distinct
normal frequency distributions. It is in like manner, however, that the
parallax stars are selected. The reason for this selection is the
following. The annual parallax can only be determined for near stars,
nearer than, say, 5 siriometers. The direct picking out of these stars
is not possible. The astronomers have therefore attacked the problem in
the following way. The near stars must, on account of their proximity,
be relatively brighter than other stars and secondly possess greater
proper motions than those. Therefore parallax observations are
essentially limited to (1) bright stars, (2) stars with great proper
motions. Hence the selected attributes of the stars are _m_ and [mu].
But _m_ and [mu] are both positively correlated to _M_. By the selection
of stars with small _m_ and great [mu] we get a series of stars which
regarding the attribute _M_ seem to be divided into two distinct
classes.

The distribution of the parallax stars gives us no reason to believe
that the stars of the types K and M are divided into the two supposed
classes. There is on the whole no reason to suppose the existence at all
of classes of giant and dwarf stars, not any more than a classification
of this kind can be made regarding the height of the men in a
population. What may be statistically concluded from the distribution of
the absolute magnitudes of the parallax stars is only that the
_dispersion_ in _M_ is increased at the transition from blue to yellow
or red stars. The filling up of the gap between the "dwarfs" and the
"giants" will probably be performed according as our knowledge of the
distance of the stars is extended, where, however, not the annual
parallax but other methods of measuring the distance must be employed.
