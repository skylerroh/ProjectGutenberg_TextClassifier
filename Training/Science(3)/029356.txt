    _A bit of levity never hurt anyone--even a science fiction editor,
    writer or reader, we hope. And a laugh has been known to lighten a
    heavy load and even change the path of history. So--we give you this
    brief moment with an amazed scientist and his startling
    creations--for a brief chuckle._


     such
 blooming
     talk

 _by ... L. Major Reynolds_


 Henderson's lovely flowers were going to bring
 him fame--until they walked and talked too much.
