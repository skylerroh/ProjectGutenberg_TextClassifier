into an earthern retort, and distilled with a strong fire. The clay
combines with the potash, for which it has great affinity, and the
nitric acid passes over, slightly impregnated with nitrous gas. This is
easily disengaged by heating the acid gently in a retort, a small
quantity of nitrous gas passes over into the recipient, and very pure
concentrated nitric acid remains in the retort.

We have already seen that azote is the nitric radical. If to 20-1/2
parts, by weight, of azote 43-1/2 parts of oxygen be added, 64 parts of
nitrous gas are formed; and, if to this we join 36 additional parts of
oxygen, 100 parts of nitric acid result from the combination.
Intermediate quantities of oxygen between these two extremes of
oxygenation produce different species of nitrous acid, or, in other
words, nitric acid less or more impregnated with nitrous gas. I
ascertained the above proportions by means of decomposition; and, though
I cannot answer for their absolute accuracy, they cannot be far removed
from truth. Mr Cavendish, who first showed by synthetic experiments that
azote is the base of nitric acid, gives the proportions of azote a
little larger than I have done; but, as it is not improbable that he
produced the nitrous acid and not the nitric, that circumstance explains
in some degree the difference in the results of our experiments.

As, in all experiments of a philosophical nature, the utmost possible
degree of accuracy is required, we must procure the nitric acid for
experimental purposes, from nitre which has been previously purified
from all foreign matter. If, after distillation, any sulphuric acid is
suspected in the nitric acid, it is easily separated by dropping in a
little nitrat of barytes, so long as any precipitation takes place; the
sulphuric acid, from its greater affinity, attracts the barytes, and
forms with it an insoluble neutral salt, which falls to the bottom. It
may be purified in the same manner from muriatic acid, by dropping in a
little nitrat of silver so long as any precipitation of muriat of silver
is produced. When these two precipitations are finished, distill off
about seven-eighths of the acid by a gentle heat, and what comes over is
in the most perfect degree of purity.

The nitric acid is one of the most prone to combination, and is at the
same time very easily decomposed. Almost all the simple substances, with
the exception of gold, silver, and platina, rob it less or more of its
oxygen; some of them even decompose it altogether. It was very anciently
known, and its combinations have been more studied by chemists than
those of any other acid. These combinations were named _nitres_ by
Messrs Macquer and Beaume; but we have changed their names to nitrats
and nitrites, according as they are formed by nitric or by nitrous acid,
and have added the specific name of each particular base, to distinguish
the several combinations from each other.

SECT. XIV.--_Observations upon Sulphuric Acid and its Combinations._

For a long time this acid was procured by distillation from sulphat of
iron, in which sulphuric acid and oxyd of iron are combined, according
to the process described by Basil Valentine in the fifteenth century;
but, in modern times, it is procured more oeconomically by the
combustion of sulphur in proper vessels. Both to facilitate the
combustion, and to assist the oxygenation of the sulphur, a little
powdered saltpetre, nitrat of potash, is mixed with it; the nitre is
decomposed, and gives out its oxygen to the sulphur, which contributes
to its conversion into acid. Notwithstanding this addition, the sulphur
will only continue to burn in close vessels for a limited time; the
combination ceases, because the oxygen is exhausted, and the air of the
vessels reduced almost to pure azotic gas, and because the acid itself
remains long in the state of vapour, and hinders the progress of
combustion.

In the manufactories for making sulphuric acid in the large way, the
mixture of nitre and sulphur is burnt in large close built chambers
lined with lead, having a little water at the bottom for facilitating
the condensation of the vapours. Afterwards, by distillation in large
retorts with a gentle heat, the water passes over, slightly impregnated
with acid, and the sulphuric acid remains behind in a concentrated
state. It is then pellucid, without any flavour, and nearly double the
weight of an equal bulk of water. This process would be greatly
facilitated, and the combustion much prolonged, by introducing fresh air
into the chambers, by means of several pairs of bellows directed towards
the flame of the sulphur, and by allowing the nitrous gas to escape
through long serpentine canals, in contact with water, to absorb any
sulphuric or sulphurous acid gas it might contain.

By one experiment, Mr Berthollet found that 69 parts of sulphur in
combustion, united with 31 parts of oxygen, to form 100 parts of
sulphuric acid; and, by another experiment, made in a different manner,
he calculates that 100 parts of sulphuric acid consists of 72 parts
sulphur, combined with 28 parts of oxygen, all by weight.

This acid, in common with every other, can only dissolve metals when
they have been previously oxydated; but most of the metals are capable
of decomposing a part of the acid, so as to carry off a sufficient
quantity of oxygen, to render themselves soluble in the part of the acid
which remains undecomposed. This happens with silver, mercury, iron, and
zinc, in boiling concentrated sulphuric acid; they become first
oxydated by decomposing part of the acid, and then dissolve in the other
part; but they do not sufficiently disoxygenate the decomposed part of
the acid to reconvert it into sulphur; it is only reduced to the state
of sulphurous acid, which, being volatilised by the heat, flies off in
form of sulphurous acid gas.

Silver, mercury, and all the other metals except iron and zinc, are
insoluble in diluted sulphuric acid, because they have not sufficient
affinity with oxygen to draw it off from its combination either with the
sulphur, the sulphurous acid, or the hydrogen; but iron and zinc, being
assisted by the action of the acid, decompose the water, and become
oxydated at its expence, without the help of heat.

_Note._--The only one of these salts known to the old chemists was the
sulphite of potash, under the name of _Stahl's sulphureous salt_. So
that, before our new nomenclature, these compounds must have been named
_Stahl's sulphureous salt_, having base of fixed vegetable alkali, and
so of the rest.

In this Table we have followed Bergman's order of affinity of the
sulphuric acid, which is the same in regard to the earths and alkalies,
but it is not certain if the order be the same for the metallic
oxyds.--A.


SECT. XV.--_Observations upon Sulphurous Acid, and its Combinations._

The sulphurous acid is formed by the union of oxygen with sulphur by a
lesser degree of oxygenation than the sulphuric acid. It is procurable
either by burning sulphur slowly, or by distilling sulphuric acid from
silver, antimony, lead, mercury, or charcoal; by which operation a part
of the oxygen quits the acid, and unites to these oxydable bases, and
the acid passes over in the sulphurous state of oxygenation. This acid,
in the common pressure and temperature of the air, can only exist in
form of gas; but it appears, from the experiments of Mr Clouet, that, in
a very low temperature, it condenses, and becomes fluid. Water absorbs a
great deal more of this gas than of carbonic acid gas, but much less
than it does of muriatic acid gas.

That the metals cannot be dissolved in acids without being previously
oxydated, or by procuring oxygen, for that purpose, from the acids
during solution, is a general and well established fact, which I have
perhaps repeated too often. Hence, as sulphurous acid is already
deprived of great part of the oxygen necessary for forming the sulphuric
acid, it is more disposed to recover oxygen, than to furnish it to the
greatest part of the metals; and, for this reason, it cannot dissolve
them, unless previously oxydated by other means. From the same principle
it is that the metallic oxyds dissolve without effervescence, and with
great facility, in sulphurous acid. This acid, like the muriatic, has
even the property of dissolving metallic oxyds surcharged with oxygen,
and consequently insoluble in sulphuric acid, and in this way forms true
sulphats. Hence we might be led to conclude that there are no metallic
sulphites, were it not that the phenomena which accompany the solution
of iron, mercury, and some other metals, convince us that these metallic
substances are susceptible of two degrees of oxydation, during their
solution in acids. Hence the neutral salt in which the metal is least
oxydated must be named _sulphite_, and that in which it is fully
oxydated must be called _sulphat_. It is yet unknown whether this
distinction is applicable to any of the metallic sulphats, except those
of iron and mercury.

SECT. XVI.--_Observations upon Phosphorous and Phosphoric Acids, and
their Combinations._

Under the article Phosphorus, Part II. Sect. X. we have already given a
history of the discovery of that singular substance, with some
observations upon the mode of its existence in vegetable and animal
bodies. The best method of obtaining this acid in a state of purity is
by burning well purified phosphorus under bell-glasses, moistened on the
inside with distilled water; during combustion it absorbs twice and a
half its weight of oxygen; so that 100 parts of phosphoric acid is
composed of 28-1/2 parts of phosphorus united to 71-1/2 parts of oxygen.
This acid may be obtained concrete, in form of white flakes, which
greedily attract the moisture of the air, by burning phosphorus in a dry
glass over mercury.

To obtain phosphorous acid, which is phosphorus less oxygenated than in
the state of phosphoric acid, the phosphorus must be burnt by a very
slow spontaneous combustion over a glass-funnel leading into a crystal
phial; after a few days, the phosphorus is found oxygenated, and the
phosphorous acid, in proportion as it forms, has attracted moisture from
the air, and dropped into the phial. The phosphorous acid is readily
changed into phosphoric acid by exposure for a long time to the free
air; it absorbs oxygen from the air, and becomes fully oxygenated.

As phosphorus has a sufficient affinity for oxygen to attract it from
the nitric and muriatic acids, we may form phosphoric acid, by means of
these acids, in a very simple and cheap manner. Fill a tubulated
receiver, half full of concentrated nitric acid, and heat it gently,
then throw in small pieces of phosphorus through the tube, these are
dissolved with effervescence and red fumes of nitrous gas fly off; add
phosphorus so long as it will dissolve, and then increase the fire under
the retort to drive off the last particles of nitric acid; phosphoric
acid, partly fluid and partly concrete, remains in the retort.

[Note A: As these salts have only been understood of late, they have
not, properly speaking, any old names. Mr Morveau, in the First Volume
of the Encyclopedia, calls them _Mephites_; Mr Bergman gives them the
name of _aerated_; and Mr de Fourcroy, who calls the carbonic acid
_chalky acid_, gives them the name of _chalks_.--A]


SECT. XVII.--_Observations upon Carbonic Acid, and its Combinations._

Of all the known acids, the carbonic is the most abundant in nature; it
exists ready formed in chalk, marble, and all the calcareous stones, in
which it is neutralized by a particular earth called _lime_. To
disengage it from this combination, nothing more is requisite than to
add some sulphuric acid, or any other which has a stronger affinity for
lime; a brisk effervescence ensues, which is produced by the
disengagement of the carbonic acid which assumes the state of gas
immediately upon being set free. This gas, incapable of being condensed
into the solid or liquid form by any degree of cold or of pressure
hitherto known, unites to about its own bulk of water, and thereby forms
a very weak acid. It may likewise be obtained in great abundance from
saccharine matter in fermentation, but is then contaminated by a small
portion of alkohol which it holds in solution.

As charcoal is the radical of this acid, we may form it artificially, by
burning charcoal in oxygen gas, or by combining charcoal and metallic
oxyds in proper proportions; the oxygen of the oxyd combines with the
charcoal, forming carbonic acid gas, and the metal being left free,
recovers its metallic or reguline form.

We are indebted for our first knowledge of this acid to Dr Black, before
whose time its property of remaining always in the state of gas had made
it to elude the researches of chemistry.

It would be a most valuable discovery to society, if we could decompose
this gas by any cheap process, as by that means we might obtain, for
economical purposes, the immense store of charcoal contained in
calcareous earths, marbles, limestones, &c. This cannot be effected by
single affinity, because, to decompose the carbonic acid, it requires a
substance as combustible as charcoal itself, so that we should only make
an exchange of one combustible body for another not more valuable; but
it may possibly be accomplished by double affinity, since this process
is so readily performed by Nature, during vegetation, from the most
common materials.
