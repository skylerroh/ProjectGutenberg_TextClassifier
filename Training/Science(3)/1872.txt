Plant men of Barsoom.  A race inhabiting the Valley Dor.
      They are ten or twelve feet in height when standing
      erect; their arms are very short and fashioned after the
      manner of an elephant's trunk, being sinuous; the body
      is hairless and ghoulish blue except for a broad band
      of white which encircles the protruding, single eye, the
      pupil, iris and ball of which are dead white.  The nose
      is a ragged, inflamed, circular hole in the centre of
      the blank face, resembling a fresh bullet wound which
      has not yet commenced to bleed.  There is no mouth in
      the head.  With the exception of the face, the head is
      covered by a tangled mass of jet-black hair some eight
      or ten inches in length.  Each hair is about the thickness
      of a large angleworm.  The body, legs and feet are
      of human shape but of monstrous proportions, the
      feet being fully three feet long and very flat and broad.
      The method of feeding consists in running their odd
      hands over the surface of the turf, cropping off the
      tender vegetation with razor-like talons and sucking it
      up from two mouths, which lie one in the palm of each
      hand.  They are equipped with a massive tail about six
      feet long, quite round where it joins the body, but
      tapering to a flat, thin blade toward the end, which
      trails at right angles to the ground.  (See THE GODS OF MARS.)
