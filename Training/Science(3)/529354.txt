
"All right," said Lee unhappily, "you win. You needn't bother to rub in
the salt. I was going to chase you through all the inquiry courts for
this. Instead, you got a lucky break, so I can't do a thing. You ought
to be tarred and feathered through every city of the Federation, but
because a destroyer happened to stumble in here at the right time you'll
end up a hero." Her voice caught in a sob.

"Oh, the destroyer," Marc replied. "Ah, yes, that _was_ lucky, wasn't
it? The only hitch is--there wasn't any destroyer. Probably not one
within a million miles!" He laughed as Lee turned surprise-widened eyes
toward him.

"What they thought was a destroyer was the radar system on the side of
the rock, bouncing a signal off the moon. I gave the radar boys the word
just before Mantor dropped in on us. The crew did a damned good job of
juggling the power and frequency and all." He grinned. "Remind me to buy
them a beer sometime."

He laughed then at the girl's expression as it changed from bitter
disillusion to something akin to awe, close to hero-worship.

"And this, by the way," Polder said, "is as good a time as any to tell
you that I'd like to see you look like a woman, for a change. How about
changing into a dress before we go into town. You know, I've never seen
you out of that uniform?"

She hesitated, unsure of herself now. "That will take a little time,"
she said doubtfully.

He put hands on her slim shoulders, gave her a gentle shove toward her
quarters. "We've got time," he told her. "Lots of it. But I've been
waiting quite a while."
