(p. 171) This is a study of the constituents of the cell-walls of wheat
grain. Bran was taken as the most convenient form of the raw material,
being freed from starch by treatment with malt extract, and further
treated (1) with cold dilute ammonia, (2) cold dilute soda lye (2 p.ct.
NaOH), and (3) boiling 0.1 p.ct. NaOH. The product retained only 1.25
p.ct. proteids, and yielded 15.62 p.ct. furfural.

_Acid Hydrolysis._--The product was boiled 30 mins. with dilute acid
(1.25 p.ct. H_{2}SO_{4}), and the solution boiled until the Fehling test
showed no further increase of monoses. At the limit the reducing power
of the dissolved carbohydrates was 91.3 p.ct., that of dextrose.
Converted into osazones the analysis showed them to be _pure
pentosazones_. The _hemicellulose_ of wheat is, therefore, according to
the author, _pure pentosane_.

_Residue._--This was a lignocellulose yielding 11.5 p.ct. furfural. It
was subjected to a series of treatments with ferric ferricyanide, and
the proportion of Prussian blue fixed was determined by increase of
weight, viz. from 10 p.ct. to 47 p.ct. according to the conditions. The
results confirmed those of Cross and Bevan first obtained with the
typical lignocellulose (jute).

_Chlorination._-The residue was boiled with dilute alkali, washed, and
exposed to chlorine gas. The resulting lignone chloride was isolated by
solution in alcohol, &c. It yielded 26.7 p.ct. Cl on analysis. In this
and its properties it appeared to be identical with the product isolated
by Cross and Bevan from jute, with the empirical formula
C_{19}H_{18}Cl_{4}O_{9}.

_Cellulose_ was isolated from the residue by three of the well-known
methods, and the following comparative numbers are noteworthy:

The author remarks: 'It is evident no one feature can be urged as a
criterion in judging between the methods, but all must be taken into
consideration. Such a comparison shows the superiority of the
chlorination method.'

The cellulose is not of the normal (cotton) type, since on treatment
with sulphuric acid it dissolves with considerable discolouration, but
only to the extent of about 80 per cent. The dissolved monoses converted
into osazones were found to consist of hexoses only. The cellulose
treated with caustic soda solution (5 p.ct. NaOH) in the cold yielded 20
p.ct. of its weight of soluble constituents, but as the residue yielded
3.34 p.ct. furfural the attack of the alkali is by no means confined to
the furfuroids.

investigation has been found in practice to answer its main purpose,
viz. to afford such numerical constants as determine industrial values.
In illustration we may cite (a) the results of analyses of specially
selected samples of jute, from which it will be seen that there is a
close concordance of value as ordinarily determined from external
appearance, with the chemical constants as determined in the laboratory.

A useful series of experiments, initiated by the Institute, is that
noted under (b) and (c) above.

(1) To ascertain the quality of the fibre extracted from the plant at
different stages of growth, quantities of 400 lbs. of the stalks were
cut at successive stages and the fibre isolated after steeping 14-20
days. The fibre was shipped to England and chemically investigated, with
the following results:

No. 1. Cut before appearance of inflorescence.
 "  2.  " after budding.
 "  3.  " in flower.
 "  4.  " after appearance of seed-pod.
 "  5.  " when fully matured.

It will be thus seen that there are no changes of any essential kind in
the chemical composition of the bast fibre throughout the life-history
of the plant, confirming the conclusion that the 'incrustation' view of
lignification is consistent only with the structural features of the
changes, and so far as it has assumed the gradual overlaying of a
cellulose fibre with the lignone substance it is not in accordance with
the facts.

Examination of the samples from the point of view of textile quality
showed a superiority of No. 1 in fineness, softness, and strength; from
this stage there is observed a progressive deterioration, but the No. 4
sample (which was taken at the usual period of cutting) is superior to
No. 5.

In a further series of experiments (c) the jute was subjected to
certain chemical treatments immediately after the separation of the
fibre from the plant. These consisted in steeping (1) in solution of
sodium carbonate, as well as of plant ashes, and (2) in sulphite of
soda, the purpose of the treatments being to modify or arrest the
changes which take place in the fibre when press-packed in bales for
shipment. The samples were shipped from India under the usual conditions
and examined soon after arrival. It was found that the chemical
treatments had produced but small changes in chemical composition of the
fibre-substance. The sulphite treatment was the more marked in
influence, somewhat lowering the cellulose and nitration constants. The
conclusion drawn from the results was that they afford no prospect of
any useful modification, i.e. improvement of the textile quality of the
fibre by any chemical treatments such as could be applied to the fibre
on the spot before drying for press-packing and shipment.

The other matters investigated in the Institute laboratory and reported
on as indicated above are rather of commercial significance, and
contributed no points of moment to the chemistry of cellulose.

_Wood Gum._--The paper contains some observations on the various methods
of isolating this product. Attention is directed to the necessary
impurity of the product, and to the fact that the numbers for furfural
and for the xylose yielded by hydrolysis are considerably less than for
a pure pentosane.

_Estimation of Cellulose._--The author investigated the process of Lange
and the 'celluloses' obtained from various raw materials. The products
from the woods of birch and maple contained furfural-yielding
constituents, represented by yields of 6-8 p.ct. furfural. Preference is
given to the process by comparison with others, at the same time that it
is recommended in all cases to examine the product for furfural
quantitatively, converting the numbers into pentosane equivalents, and
subtracting from the total 'cellulose' to give the true cellulose.

~ON THE MOTHER SUBSTANCES OF WOOD-GUM.~

(p. 188) According to the text-books beech-wood may be regarded as the
typical raw material for the preparation of the laboratory product known
as wood-gum. The author has subjected beech-wood and beech-wood
cellulose (Schulze process) to a range of hydrolytic treatments, acid
and alkaline, in order to determine the conditions of selective action
upon the mother substance of the wood-gum. In the main it appears that
this group of furfuroids is equally resistant with the cellulose
constituents of the wood; in fact, that the mother substance of wood-gum
is a modified cellulose, and exists in the wood in chemical combination
with the 'incrusting substances.'

Of the author's experimental results the following may be cited as
typical:

~ON THE SOURCE OF THE UNSATURATED COMPOUNDS OF THE PLANT.~

(p. 179) In distilling for furfural by the usual methods of boiling
cellulosic products with condensing acids, the furfural is accompanied
by volatile acids, also products of decomposition of the cellulosic
complex. A series of distillations was carried out with dilute sulphuric
acids of varying concentration from 10-50 H_{2}SO_{4} : 90-50 H_{2}O by
weight, using barley straw as a typical cellulosic material. The
distillates were collected in successive fractions, and the furfural and
volatile acid determined. The results are given in the form of curves.
The aggregate yields were as follows:--

Concentration of acid
  (H_{2}SO_{4}) p.ct.            10    15    20    30    40    50

Furfural yield p.ct. of straw     2.0   2.0   4.4  10.1  11.5  11.0

Volatile acid (calculated
  as acetic acid) p.ct. of straw  1.7   1.9   3.1   4.3   6.3  14.8

With acids up to 20 p.ct. H_{2}SO_{4} both products are formed
concurrently and in nearly equal quantity. With the 30 p.ct. acid there
is a great increase in the total furfural, and with the 40 p.ct. acid it
reaches nearly the maximum obtainable with HCl of 1.06 s.g. (Tollens),
in this case 12.4 p.ct. The volatile acid increases, but in less ratio;
it is also produced concurrently. With 50 p.ct. H_{2}SO_{4} the
conditions are changed. The total furfural is rapidly formed, whereas
the volatile acid continues to be formed long after the aldehyde ceases
to come over. Moreover, whereas in the previous cases it was mainly
acetic acid, it is now mainly formic acid. The method was then extended
to a typical series of celluloses, heated with the more concentrated
acid (40-50 p.ct. H_{2}SO_{4}), with the following results:
