deceive them."

"I'll live long enough," Whiting said, and Steve knew then that he
would. "Luck to--all of you. From a--very foolish--man...."

Steve took Mary's hand and pulled her out into the hot, dark, wind-blown
night. He carried the dead Kumaji's pike and they slipped across the
sand to where the _thlots_ were hobbled for the night. He hardly
remembered the rest of it. There was violence and death, but necessary
death. He killed a man with the pike, and unhobbled one of the _thlots_.
The animal screamed and two more Kumajis came sleepily through the night
to see what was the matter. With the long edge of the pike's blade he
decapitated one of them. He slammed the shaft of the weapon across the
other's face, probably breaking his jaw. The camp was in a turmoil. In
the darkness he flung Mary on the _thlot's_ bare back in front of him,
and they glided off across the sand.

Pursuit was disorganized--and unsuccessful. It was too dark for
effective pursuit, as Steve had hoped it would be. They rode swiftly all
night and continued riding with the dawn. They could have gone in any
direction. The wind-driven sand would obliterate their trail.

Two days later they reached the caravan. As they rode up, Mary said,
"Steve, do you have to tell them?"

"We can tell them this," Steve said. "Your father died a hero's death,
sending the Kumajis off in the wrong direction."

"And not--not what he'd planned to do at first."

"No. We'll tell them that was his intention all the while. A man can
make a mistake, can't he?"

"I love you, Steve. I love you."

Then they rode down on the caravan. Somehow Steve knew they would all
reach Oasis City in safety.

With Mary he would find a new world out in the vastness of space.
