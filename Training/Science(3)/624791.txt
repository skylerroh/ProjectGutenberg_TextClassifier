back along the ledge.

Mr. Wordsley waited just a moment longer; then he took from his pocket a
heavy object and dropped it upon the slope and it rolled over and over,
down and down, until its metallic sheen was lost in that superior glare.

It was a spare irmium alloy plug.

He made his way back to the water-maker. They would have to take good
care of it from now on.

He was not concerned with the basin. However, in the soft, damp sand
beside the basin, plainly imprinted there, as if someone's raiding party
had interrupted _someone's_ bathing party, there remained a single,
small and dainty footprint.

One could almost imagine that a faint breath of perfume still lingered
upon the sheltered air of the rift, but, of course, only things which
glittered interested Mr. Wordsley.
