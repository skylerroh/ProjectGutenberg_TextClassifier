March, 1998  [Etext #1233]


**The Project Gutenberg Etext of Origin and Nature of Emotions**
******This file should be named 1233.txt or 1233.zip******


Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we do NOT keep these books
in compliance with any particular paper edition, usually otherwise.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1998 for a total of 1500+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 150 billion Etexts given away.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

THE ORIGIN AND NATURE

of the

EMOTIONS

Miscellaneous Papers

BY

GEORGE W. CRILE, M.D.

PROFESSOR OF SURGERY, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY
VISITING SURGEON TO THE LAKESIDE HOSPITAL, CLEVELAND

EDITED BY
AMY F. ROWLAND, B. S.




PREFACE


IN response to numerous requests I have brought together into this volume
eight papers which may serve as a supplement to the volumes previously
published[*] and as a preface to monographs now in preparation.


[*] Surgical Shock, 1899; Surgery of the Respiratory System, 1899;
Problems Relating to Surgical Operations, 1901; Blood Pressure
in Surgery, 1903; Hemorrhage and Transfusion, 1909;
Anemia and Resuscitation, 1914; and Anoci-association, 1914
(with Dr. W. E. Lower).


In the first of these addresses, the Ether Day Address, delivered at
the Massachusetts General Hospital in October, 1910, I first
enunciated the Kinetic Theory of Shock, the key to which was found
in laboratory researches and in a study of Darwin's "Expression
of the Emotions in Man and in Animals," whereby the phylogenetic
origin of the emotions was made manifest and the pathologic
identity of surgical and emotional shock was established.
Since 1910 my associates and I have continued our researches through--
(a) Histologic studies of all the organs and tissues of the body;
(b) Estimation of the H-ion concentration of the blood in the emotions
of anger and fear and after the application of many other forms of stimuli;
(c) Functional tests of the adrenals, and (d) Clinical observations.

It would seem that if the striking changes produced by fear
and anger and by physical trauma in the master organ of the body--
the brain--were due to WORK, then we should expect to find
corresponding histologic changes in other organs of the body as well.
We therefore examined every organ and tissue of the bodies of animals
which had been subjected to intense fear and anger and to infection and
to the action of foreign proteins, some animals being killed immediately;
some several hours after the immediate effects of the stimuli had passed;
some after seances of strong emotion had been repeated several
times during a week or longer.

The examination of all the tissues and organs of these animals
showed changes in three organs only, and with few exceptions in all
three of these organs--the brain, the adrenals, and the liver.
The extent of these changes is well shown by the photomicrographs
which illustrate the paper on "The Kinetic System" which is included
in this volume.  This paper describes many experiments which show
that the brain, the adrenal, and the liver play together constantly
and that no one of these organs--as far at least as is indicated
by the histologic studies--can act without the co-operation
of the other two.

Another striking fact which has been experimentally established
is that the deterioration of these three organs caused by emotion,
by exertion, and by other causes is largely counteracted,
if not exclusively, during sleep.  If animals exhausted by the continued
application of a stimulus are allowed complete rest for a certain
number of hours, _*without sleep_, the characteristic histologic
appearance of exhaustion in the brain, adrenals, and liver is not
altered notably, whereas in animals allowed to sleep for the same
number of hours the histologic changes in these organs are lessened--
in some cases obliterated even.

This significant phenomenon and its relation will be dealt with in
a later monograph.

Many of the arguments and illustrations by which the primary
premises were established are repeated--a few in all--many in
more than one of these addresses.  It will be observed, however,
that the APPLICATION of these premises varies, and that their
SIGNIFICANCE broadens progressively.

In the Ether Day Address the phylogenetic key supplied by Darwin was
utilized to formulate the principle that the organism reacts as a unit
to the stimuli of physical injury, of emotion, of infection, etc.
To the study of these reactions (transformations of energy)
the epoch-making work of Sherrington, "The Integrative Action
of the Nervous System," gave an added key by which the dominating
role of the brain was determined.  Later the original work
of Cannon on the adrenal glands gave facts, and an experimental
method by which Darwin's phylogenetic theory of the emotions
was further elaborated in other papers, especially in the one
entitled "Phylogenetic Association in Relation to the Emotions,"
read before The American Philosophical Society in April, 1911.

PHYLOGENETIC ASSOCIATION IN RELATION TO CERTAIN MEDICAL PROBLEMS[*]


[*] Address delivered at the Massachusetts General Hospital on
the sixty-fourth anniversary of Ether Day, Oct. 15, 1910.


The discovery of the anesthetic properties of ether and its practical
application to surgery must always stand as one of the great
achievements of medicine.  It is eminently fitting that the anniversary
of that notable day, when the possibilities of ether were first
made known to the world, should be celebrated within these walls,
and whatever the topic of your Ether Day orator, he must fittingly
pause first to pay tribute to that great event and to the master
surgeons of the Massachusetts General Hospital.  On this occasion,
on behalf of the dumb animals as well as on behalf of suffering humanity,
I express a deep sense of gratitude for the blessings of anesthesia.

Two years ago, an historic appreciation of the discovery of ether
was presented here by Professor Welch, and last year an address
on medical research was given by President Eliot.  I, therefore,
will not attempt a general address, but will invite your
attention to an experimental and clinical study.  In presenting
the summaries of the large amount of data in these researches,
I acknowledge with gratitude the great assistance rendered by
my associates, Dr. D. H. Dolley, Dr. H. G. Sloan, Dr. J. B. Austin,
and Dr. M. L. Menten.[*]

Western Reserve University, Cleveland.


The scope of this paper may be explained by a concrete example.
When a barefoot boy steps on a sharp stone there is an immediate discharge
of nervous energy in his effort to escape from the wounding stone.
This is not a voluntary act.  It is not due to his own personal experience--
his ontogeny--but is due to the experience of his progenitors
during the vast periods of time required for the evolution
of the species to which he belongs, _i.  e_., his phylogeny.
The wounding stone made an impression upon the nerve receptors
in the foot similar to the innumerable injuries which gave origin
to this nerve mechanism itself during the boy's vast phylogenetic or
ancestral experience.  The stone supplied the phylogenetic association,
and the appropriate discharge of nervous energy automatically followed.
If the sole of the foot be repeatedly bruised or crushed by a stone,
shock may be produced; if the stone be only lightly applied,
then the consequent sensation of tickling causes a discharge of
nervous energy.  In like manner there have been implanted in the body
other mechanisms of ancestral or phylogenetic origin whose purpose
is the discharge of nervous energy for the good of the individual.
In this paper I shall discuss the origin and mode of action of some
of these mechanisms and their relation to certain phases of anesthesia.

The word anesthesia--meaning WITHOUT FEELING--describes accurately
the effect of ether in anesthetic dosage.  Although no pain
is felt in operations under inhalation anesthesia, the _*nerve
impulses excited by a surgical operation still reach the brain_.
We know that not every portion of the brain is fully anesthetized,
since surgical anesthesia does not kill.  The question then is:
What effect has trauma under surgical anesthesia upon the part
of the brain THAT REMAINS AWAKE?  If, in surgical anesthesia,
the traumatic impulses cause an excitation of the wide-awake cells,
are the remainder of the cells of the brain, despite anesthesia,
affected in any way?  If so, they are prevented by the anesthesia from
expressing that influence in conscious perception or in muscular action.
Whether the ANESTHETIZED cells are influenced or not must be determined
by noting the physiologic functions of the body after anesthesia has
worn off, and in animals by an examination of the brain-cells as well.
It has long been known that the vasomotor, the cardiac, and the respiratory
centers discharge energy in response to traumatic stimuli applied
to various sensitive regions of the body during surgical anesthesia.
If the trauma be sufficient, exhaustion of the entire brain
will be observed after the effect of the anesthesia has worn off;
that is to say, despite the complete paralysis of voluntary
motion and the loss of consciousness due to ether, the traumatic
impulses that are known to reach the AWAKE centers in the medulla
also reach and influence every other part of the brain.
Whether or not the consequent functional depression and the morphologic
alterations seen in the brain-cells may be due to the low blood-pressure
which follows excessive trauma is shown by the following experiments:
The circulation of animals was first rendered STATIC by over-transfusion,
and was controlled by a continuous blood-pressure record on a drum,
the factor of anemia being thereby wholly excluded during the application
of the trauma and during the removal of a specimen of brain tissue
for histologic study.  In each instance, morphologic changes
in the cells of all parts of the brain were found, but it required
much more trauma to produce brain-cell changes in animals whose
blood-pressure was kept at the normal level than in the animals
whose blood-pressure was allowed to take a downward course.
In the cortex and in the cerebellum, the changes in the brain-cells
were in every instance more marked than in the medulla.

There is also strong NEGATIVE evidence that traumatic impulses
are not excluded by ether anesthesia from the part of the brain
that is apparently asleep.  This evidence is as follows:
If the factor of fear be excluded, and if in addition the traumatic
impulses be prevented from reaching the brain by cocain[*] blocking,
then, despite the intensity or the duration of the trauma within
the zone so blocked, there follows no exhaustion after the effect
of the anesthetic disappears, and no morphologic changes are noted
in the brain-cells.


[*] Since the presentation of this paper, novocain has been
substituted for cocain in operations under anoci-association.


Still further negative evidence that inhalation anesthesia offers
little or no protection to the brain-cells against trauma is derived
from the following experiment:  A dog whose spinal cord had been
divided at the level of the first dorsal segment, and which had
then been kept in good condition for two months, showed a recovery
of the spinal reflexes, such as the scratch reflex, etc.  Such an
animal is known as a "spinal dog."  Now, in this animal, the abdomen
and hind extremities had no direct nerve connection with the brain.
In this dog, continuous severe trauma of the abdominal viscera and of
the hind extremities lasting for four <p 5-7> hours was accompanied
by but slight change in either the circulation or in the respiration,
and by no microscopic alteration of the brain-cells (Fig. 1). Judging
from a large number of experiments on NORMAL dogs under ether,
such an amount of trauma would have caused not only complete
physiologic exhaustion of the brain, but also morphologic alterations
of all of the brain-cells and the physical destruction of many
(Fig. 2). We must, therefore, conclude that, although ether anesthesia
produces unconsciousness, it APPARENTLY PROTECTS NONE OF THE BRAIN-CELLS
against exhaustion from the trauma of surgical operations; ether is,
so to speak, but a veneer.  Under nitrous oxid anesthesia there is
approximately only one-fourth as much exhaustion as is produced by equal
trauma under ether (Fig. 3). We must conclude, therefore, either that
nitrous oxid protects the brain-cells against trauma or that ether
predisposes the brain-cells to exhaustion as a result of trauma.
With these premises let us now inquire into the cause of this
exhaustion of the brain-cells.


The Cause of the Exhaustion of the Brain-cells as a Result of Trauma
of Various Parts of the Body under Inhalation Anesthesia


Numerous experiments on animals to determine the effect of ether
anesthesia _per se_, _i.  e_., ether anesthesia without trauma,
showed that, although certain changes were produced, these included
neither the physiologic exhaustion nor the alterations in the
brain-cells which are characteristic of the effects of trauma.
On turning to the study of trauma, we at once found in the behavior
of individuals as a whole under deep and under light anesthesia
the clue to the cause of the discharge of energy, of the consequent
physiologic exhaustion, and of the morphologic changes in the brain-cells.

If, in the course of abdominal operations, rough manipulations
of the parietal peritoneum be made, there will be frequently
observed a marked increase in the respiratory rate and an increase
