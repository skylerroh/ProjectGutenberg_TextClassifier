ANNOUNCEMENTS


AN ELEMENTARY STUDY OF CHEMISTRY

By WILLIAM McPHERSON, Professor of Chemistry in Ohio State University,
and WILLIAM E. HENDERSON, Associate Professor of Chemistry in Ohio State
University.

12mo. Cloth. 434 pages. Illustrated. List price, $1.25; mailing price,
$1.40

This book is the outgrowth of many years of experience in the teaching
of elementary chemistry. In its preparation the authors have steadfastly
kept in mind the limitations of the student to whom chemistry is a new
science. They have endeavored to present the subject in a clear,
well-graded way, passing in a natural and logical manner from principles
which are readily understood to those which are more difficult to grasp.
The language is simple and as free as possible from unusual and
technical phrases. Those which are unavoidable are carefully defined.
The outline is made very plain, and the paragraphing is designed to be
of real assistance to the student in his reading.

The book is in no way radical, either in the subject-matter selected or
in the method of treatment. At the same time it is in thorough harmony
with the most recent developments in chemistry, both in respect to
theory and discovery. Great care has been taken in the theoretical
portions to make the treatment simple and well within the reach of the
ability of an elementary student. The most recent discoveries have been
touched upon where they come within the scope of an elementary text.
Especial attention has been given to the practical applications of
chemistry, and to the description of the manufacturing processes in use
at the present time.
