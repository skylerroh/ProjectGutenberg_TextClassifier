floats in the serum, called coagulum. This coagulated mass is composed
of fibrin, and red globulated matter. The color of the red globules is
owing to the presence of iron, though some physiologists think it
depends on an animal substance of a gelatinous character.

_Observation._ That portion of the serum which remains fluid after
coagulation by heat has taken place, is called _se-ros'i-ty_. It is
more abundant in the blood of old, than in that of young animals; and
it forms the "red gravy" in roasted meats.

454. The blood is not necessarily red. It may be white, as in most
fish. There is no animal in which the blood is equally red in all
parts of the body. The ligaments, tendons, and other white tissues in
man are supplied but sparingly with red blood. The fluid that supplies
these tissues is whitish.

HYGIENE OF NUTRITION.

455. _Healthy nutrition requires pure blood._ If the nutrient arteries
of the bones are supplied with impure blood, they will become soft or
brittle, their vitality will be impaired, and disease will be the
ultimate result. The five hundred muscles receive another portion of
the blood. These organs are attached to, and act upon the bones. Upon
the health and contractile energy of the muscles depends the ability
to labor. Give these organs of motion impure blood, which is an
unhealthy stimulus, and they will become enfeebled, the step will lose
its elasticity, the movement of the arm will be inefficient, and every
muscle will be incapacitated to perform its usual amount of labor.

456. When the stomach, liver, and other organs subservient to the
digestion of food, are supplied with impure blood, the digestive
process is impaired, causing faintness and loss of appetite, also a
deranged state of the intestines, and, in general, all the symptoms of
dyspepsia.

457. The delicate structure of the lungs, in which the blood is or
should be purified, needs the requisite amount of pure blood to give
them vigor and health. When the blood is not of this character, the
lungs themselves lose their tone, and, even if permitted to expand
freely, have not power fully to change the impure quality of this
circulating fluid.

458. The health and beauty of the skin require that the blood should
be well purified; but, if the arteries of the skin receive vitiated
blood, pimples and blotches appear, and the individual suffers from
"humors." Drinks, made of various kinds of herbs, as well as pills
and powders, are taken for this affection. These will never have the
desired effect, while the causes of impure blood exist.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

455-462. _Give the hygiene of nutrition._ 455. What is the effect of
impure blood upon the bones? On the muscles? 456. On the digestive
organs? 457. On the lungs? 458. What is the effect if the vessels of
the skin are supplied with vitiated blood?

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

459. If the nutrient arteries convey impure material to the brain, the
nervous and bilious headache, confusion of ideas, loss of memory,
impaired intellect, dimness of vision, and dulness of hearing, will be
experienced; and in process of time, the brain becomes disorganized,
and the brittle thread of life is broken.

_Observations._ 1st. An exertion of any organ beyond its powers,
induces weakness that will disturb the nutrition of the part that is
called into action; and it recovers its energy more slowly in
proportion to the excess of the exertion. The function of the organ
may be totally and permanently destroyed, if the exertion is extremely
violent. We sometimes see palsy produced in a muscle simply by the
effort to raise too great a weight. The sight is impaired, and total
blindness may be produced, by exposure to light too strong or too
constant. The mind may be deranged, or idiocy may follow the excess of
study or the over-tasking of the brain.

2d. When the function of an organ is permanently impaired or destroyed
by over-exertion, the nutrition of the part is rendered insufficient,
or is entirely arrested; and then the absorbents remove it wholly or
partially, as they do every thing that is no longer useful. Thus, in
palsied patients, a few years after the attack, we often find scarce
any trace of the palsied muscles remaining; they are reduced almost to
simple cellular tissue. The condition of the calf of the leg, in a
person having a club-foot, is a familiar proof of this.

460. _The blood may be made impure, by the chyle being deficient in
quantity or defective in quality._ This state of the chyle may be
produced by the food being improper in quantity or quality, or by its
being taken in an improper manner, at an improper time, and when the
system is not prepared for it. The remedy for impure blood produced in
any of these ways is to correct the injudicious method of using food.
(See Chapters XV. and XVI.)

459. How does impure blood affect the brain? What is the effect when
any organ is exerted beyond its powers? What is the effect when an
organ is permanently impaired? 460. How may the blood become impure?

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

461. _The blood may also be rendered impure, by not supplying it with
oxygen in the lungs, and by the carbon not being eliminated from the
system through this channel._ The remedy for "impurities of the
blood," produced in this manner, would be, to carefully reduce to
practice the directions in the chapters on the hygiene of the
respiratory organs, relative to the free movements of the ribs and
diaphragm, and the proper ventilation of rooms.

462. _A retention of the waste products of the skin produces impure
blood._ When the vessels of the skin, by which the waste, useless
material is eliminated from the system, have become inactive by
improper and inadequate clothing, or by a want of cleanliness, the
dead, injurious atoms of matter are retained in the circulatory
vessels. The only successful method of purifying the blood and
restoring health when this condition exists, is to observe the
directions given relative to clothing and bathing. (See Chapters
XXXIII. and XXXIV.)

_Observation._ If the blood has become "impure," or "loaded with
humors," (an idea generally prevalent,) it is not and cannot be
"purified" by taking patent pills, powders, drops, &c. But, on the
contrary, by observing the suggestions in the preceding paragraphs,
the blood can be freed of its impurities, and, what is of greater
importance, such "injurious humors" will be prevented.

CHAPTER XXIII.

THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS.


463. The nutrient portion of the food is poured into the left
subclavian vein, (24, 27, fig. 88,) at the lower part of the neck, and
is carried to the right cavities of the heart. The fluid in these
cavities consists of the chyle incorporated with the impure blood.
Neither of these two elements is fitted to promote the growth or
repair the waste of the body. They must be subjected to a process, by
which the first can be converted into blood, and the second freed of
its carbonic acid gas and water. This is effected by the _Respiratory
Organs_.


ANATOMY OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS.

464. The RESPIRATORY ORGANS are the _Lungs_, (lights,) the _Tra'che-a_,
(windpipe,) the _Bronch'i-a_, (subdivisions of the trachea,) and the
_Air-Ves'i-cles_, (air-cells at the extremities of the bronchia.) The
_Di'a-phragm_, (midriff,) _Ribs_, and several _Muscles_, also aid in the
respiratory process.

465. The LUNGS are conical organs, one on each side of the chest,
embracing the heart, (fig. 88,) and separated from each other by a
membranous partition. The color of the lungs is a pinkish gray,
mottled, and variously marked with black. Each lung is divided into
lobes, by a long and deep fissure, which extends from the posterior
surface of the upper part of the organ, downward and forward, nearly
to the anterior angle of the base. In the right lung, the upper lobe
is subdivided by a second fissure. This lung is larger and shorter
than the left. It has three lobes, while the left has only two.

463. What fluids are conveyed into the right cavities of the heart?
What is necessary before they can be adapted to the wants of the body?
By what organs are these changes effected? 464-474. _Give the anatomy
of the respiratory organs._ 464. Name the respiratory organs. What
organs also aid in the respiratory process? 465. Describe the lungs.

Explain fig. 89.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

466. Each lung is enclosed, and its structure maintained by a serous
membrane, called the _pleu'ra_, which invests it as far as the root,
and is thence reflected upon the walls of the chest. The lungs,
however, are on the outside of the pleura, in the same way as the head
is on the outside of a cap doubled upon itself. The reflected pleurae
in the middle of the thorax form a partition, which divides the chest
into two cavities. This partition is called the _me-di-as-ti'num_.

_Observation._ When this membrane that covers the lungs, and also
lines the chest, is inflamed, the disease is called "pleurisy."

466. By what are the lungs enclosed? What is the relative position of
the lungs and pleura? What is said of the reflected pleurae? Explain
fig. 90. What part of the lungs is affected in pleurisy?

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

467. The lungs are composed of the ramifications of the bronchial
tubes, which terminate in the bronchial cells, (_air-cells_,)
lymphatics, and the divisions of the pulmonary artery and veins. All
of these are connected by cellular tissue, which constitutes the
_pa-ren'chy-ma_. Each lung is retained in its place by its _root_,
which is formed by the pulmonary arteries, pulmonary veins, and
bronchial tubes, together with the bronchial vessels and pulmonary
nerves.

468. The TRACHEA extends from the larynx, of which it is a continuation,
to the third dorsal vertebra, where it divides into two parts, called
bronchia. It lies anterior to the spinal column, from which it is
separated by the oesophagus.

469. The BRONCHIA proceed from the bifurcation, or division of the
trachea, to their corresponding lungs. Upon entering the lungs, they
divide into two branches, and each branch divides and subdivides, and
ultimately terminates in small sacs, or cells, of various sizes, from
the twentieth to the hundredth of an inch in diameter. So numerous are
these bronchial or air-cells, that the aggregate extent of their
lining membrane in man has been computed to exceed a surface of 20,000
square inches, and Munro states that it is thirty times the surface of
the human body.

_Illustration._ The trachea may be compared to the trunk of a tree;
the bronchia, to two large branches; the subdivisions of the bronchia,
to the branchlets and twigs; the air-cells, to the buds seen on the
twigs in the spring.

470. The AIR-VESICLES and small bronchial tubes compose the largest
portions of the lungs. These, when once inflated, contain air, under
all circumstances, which renders their specific gravity much less than
water; hence the vulgar term, _lights_, for these organs. The trachea
and bronchial tubes are lined by mucous membrane. The structure of
this membrane is such, that it will bear the presence of pure air
without detriment, but not of other substances.

What membrane lines the trachea and its branches? What is peculiar in

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

_Observation._ The structure of the trachea and lungs may be
illustrated, by taking these parts of a calf or sheep and inflating
the air-vesicles by forcing air into the windpipe with a pipe or
quill. The internal structure may then be seen by opening the
different parts.

471. The lungs, like other portions of the system, are supplied
with nutrient arteries and nerves. The nervous filaments that
are distributed to these organs are in part from the tenth pair,
(par vagum,) that originates in the brain, and in part from the
sympathetic nerve. The muscles that elevate the ribs and the
diaphragm receive nervous fibres from a separate system, which is
called the respiratory.

[Illustration: Fig. 92. 1, A bronchial tube. 2, 2, 2, Air-vesicles. Both
the tube and vesicles are much magnified. 3, A bronchial tube and
vesicles laid open.]

_Observation._ When the mucous membrane of a few of the larger
branches of the windpipe is slightly inflamed, it is called a "cold;"
when the inflammation is greater, and extends to the lesser air-tubes,
it is called _bronch-i'tis_. When the air-cells and parenchyma become
inflamed, it is called inflammation of the lungs. Coughing is a
violent expulsory effort by which air is suddenly forced through the
bronchia and trachea to remove offending matter.

472. The RIBS are joined to the spinal column at their posterior
extremity; and in front, they terminate in cartilages, which unite
them to the sternum. They incline downward, from the spinal column to
the breast-bone, and form resisting walls that assist in producing the
partial vacuum necessary for inspiration.

[Illustration: Fig. 93. A section of the chest when the lungs are
inflated. 1, The diaphragm. 2, The muscular walls of the abdomen.]

These engravings show the diaphragm to be more convex, and the walls
of the abdomen more flattened, when the lungs are collapsed, than when
they are inflated.

473. The DIAPHRAGM is a flexible circular partition, that separates
the respiratory from the digestive organs, and the chest from the
abdomen. Its margin is attached to the spinal column, the sternum, and
cartilages of the lower ribs. The lungs rest upon its upper surface,
while the liver and stomach are placed below it, (fig. 88.) In a
state of repose, its upper surface forms an arch, the convexity of
which is toward the chest. In forced expiration, its upper point
reaches as high as the fourth rib. In an ordinary inspiration, it is
depressed as low as the seventh rib, which increases the capacity of
the chest.

472. Describe the ribs. Explain figs. 93 and 94. 473. Describe the

474. The RESPIRATORY muscles are, in general, attached at one
extremity to the parts about the shoulders, head, and upper portion
of the spinal column. From these, they run downward and forward, and
are attached, at the opposite extremity, to the sternum, clavicle,
and upper rib. Other muscles are attached at one extremity to a rib
above, and by the opposite extremity to a rib below. These fill the
spaces between the ribs, and, from their situation, are called
_in-ter-cost'al_ muscles.

_Observation._ 1st. There are several actions of common occurrence,
that are intimately connected with respiration; such as hiccough,
sneezing, &c. Hiccough is an involuntary contraction of the muscles of
respiration, particularly the diaphragm.

2d. Sneezing is a violent, involuntary contraction of the respiratory
muscles, as in hiccough. When an acrid stimulant, as snuff, is applied
to the mucous membrane of the nose, an irritation is produced which is
accompanied by a violent expulsion of air from the lungs. This is
owing to the connection between the nasal and respiratory nerves.

CHAPTER XXIV.

PHYSIOLOGY OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS.


475. RESPIRATION, or breathing, is that process by which air is taken
into the lungs and expelled from them. The object of respiration is,
1st. To supply the system with oxygen, which is essential to the
generation of animal heat; 2d. To convert the chyle into blood. This
is done by the oxygen of the inspired air; 3d. To relieve the organs
of the body of the principal elements (carbon and hydrogen) that
compose the old and useless particles of matter. The organs of the
system, as already mentioned, are principally composed of carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.

476. By the action of the lymphatics and capillary veins, the old and
worn-out particles are conveyed into the veins of the systemic
circulation. The hydrogen, in form of watery vapor, is easily
discharged in the perspiration and other secretions. The nitrogen and
oxygen are, or may be, separated from the blood, through the agency of
several different organs; but carbon does not escape so readily. It is
probable that a part of the surplus carbon of the venous blood is
secreted by the liver; but a far greater amount passes to the lungs,
and these may be considered as special organs designed to separate
this element from the venous blood.

477. An ordinary inspiration may be accomplished by the action of the
diaphragm, and a slight elevation of the ribs. In full inspiration,
the diaphragm is not only more depressed but the ribs are evidently
elevated. To produce this effect on the ribs, two sets of muscles are
called into action. Those which are attached to the upper rib,
sternum, and clavicle, contract and elevate the lower and free
extremities of the ribs. This enlarges the cavity of the chest between
the spinal column and the sternum. But the lateral diameter, in
consequence, is only slightly increased, because the central portion
of the ribs sinks lower than their posterior extremities, or their
cartilaginous attachment to the sternum.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

475-494. _Give the physiology of the respiratory organs._ 475. What is
respiration? What is the principal object in breathing? 476. How are
the useless atoms of matter conveyed into the veins of the systemic
circulation? How may the principal elementary substances be separated

[Illustration: Fig. 95. 6, Four of the vertebrae, to which are attached
three ribs, (7, 7, 7,) with their intercostal muscles, (8, 8.) These
ribs, in their natural position, have their anterior cartilaginous
extremity at 4, while the posterior extremity is attached to the
vertebrae, (6,) which are neither elevated nor depressed in respiration.
1, 1, and 2, 2, parallel lines, within which the ribs lie in their
natural position. If the anterior extremity of the ribs is elevated from
4 to 5, they will not lie within the line 2, 2, but will reach the line
3, 3. If two hands extend from 1, 1, to 2, 2, they will effectually
prevent the elevation of the ribs from 4 to 5, as the line 2, 2, cannot
be moved to 3, 3.]

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

What effect has a full inspiration on the ribs and diaphragm? How is
the chest enlarged between the spinal column and sternum? What is said
of the lateral diameter of the chest? Explain fig. 95.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

478. The central portion of the ribs is raised by the action of
intercostal muscles. The first, or upper rib, has but little movement;
the second has more motion than the first, while the third has still
more than the second. The second rib is elevated by the contraction of
the muscles between it and the first. The third rib is raised by the
action of two sets of muscles; one lies between the first and second
ribs, the other between the second and third. The motion of each
succeeding rib is increased, because it is not only acted upon by the
muscles that move the ribs above, but by an additional intercostal; so
that the movement of the twelfth rib is very free, as it is elevated
by the contraction of eleven muscles.

479. The tenth rib is raised eight times as much as the second rib,
and the lateral diameter of the lower portion of the chest is
increased in a corresponding degree. At the same time, the muscular
margin of the diaphragm contracts, which depresses its central
portion; and in this way, the chest is enlarged forward, laterally,
and downward, simultaneously with the relaxation of the walls of the
abdomen.

480. The lungs follow the variations of capacity in the chest,
expanding their air-cells when the latter is enlarged, and contracting
when the chest is diminished. Thus, when the chest is expanded, the
lungs follow, and consequently a vacuum is produced in their
air-cells. The air then rushes through the mouth and nose into the
trachea and its branches, and fills the vacuum as fast as it is made.
This mechanical process constitutes _inspiration_.

481. After the expansion of the chest, the muscles that elevated the
ribs relax, together with the diaphragm. The elasticity of the
cartilages of the ribs depresses them, and the cavity of the chest is
diminished, attended by the expulsion of a portion of the air from the
lungs. At the same time, the muscles that form the front walls of the
abdominal cavity, contract, and press the alimentary canal, stomach,
and liver, upward against the diaphragm; this, being relaxed, yields
to the pressure, rises upward, and presses upon the lungs, which
retreat before it, and another portion of air is expelled from these
organs. This process is called _expiration_.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

478. Describe the action of the intercostal muscles upon the ribs.
479. How does the elevation of the tenth rib compare with the second?
What effect has this elevation upon the lateral diameter of the chest?

which the air is forced out of the lungs.

482. Thus it is obvious that the enlargement of the chest, or
inspiration, is produced in two ways: 1st. By the depression of the
convex portion of the diaphragm; 2d. By the elevation of the ribs. On
the contrary, the contraction of the chest, or expiration, is
produced by the depression of the ribs, and elevation of the central
part of the diaphragm. These movements are successive during life, and
constitute _respiration_.

_Experiment._ Place the ear upon the chest of a person, and a
murmuring sound will be heard, somewhat like the soft sighings of the
wind through forest trees. This sound is caused by the air rushing in
and out of the lungs, and is peculiarly distinct in the child.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Explain fig. 97. How may the murmur of respiration be heard?

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

483. It is not easy to decide how much air is taken into the lungs at
each inspiration. The quantity, however, must vary in different
individuals, from the difference in the condition and expansion of the
lungs, together with the size of the chest. From numerous experiments,
the quantity, at an ordinary inspiration, of a common-sized man, is
fixed at forty cubic inches. It has been estimated that one hundred
and seventy cubic inches can be thrown out of the lungs by a forcible
expiration, and that there remain in the lungs two hundred and twenty
cubic inches; so that these organs, in their quiescent state, may be
considered as containing about three hundred and ninety cubic inches
of air, or more than a gallon.

484. Respiration is more frequent in females and children than in
adult men. In diseases, particularly those of the lungs, it is more
increased in frequency than the action of the heart. In health, the
smallest number of inspirations in a minute by an adult, is not less
than fourteen, and they rarely exceed twenty-five. Eighteen may be
considered an average number. The quantity of oxygen taken into the
lungs at each inspiration is about eight cubic inches, one half of
which disappears in every act of respiration.

_Observation._ Under different circumstances, however, the consumption
of oxygen varies. It is greater when the temperature is low, than when
it is high; and during digestion the consumption has been found one
half greater than when the stomach was empty.

483. Can it be ascertained with accuracy how much air is taken into
the lungs at each inspiration? Why not? What is the probable quantity
that an ordinary sized man inspires? How much can be thrown out of the
lungs at a forcible expiration, and how much remains in the lungs?
From these calculations, how much may they contain in their quiescent
state? 484. In whom is respiration most frequent? How in disease? How
in health? How many may be considered an average number? When is the
consumption of oxygen the greatest?

485. Dr. Southwood Smith has lately performed a series of very
interesting experiments, from which he deduces the following general
results: "1st. The volume of air ordinarily present in the lungs is
about twelve pints. 2d. The volume of air received by the lungs at an
ordinary inspiration is one pint. 3d. The volume of air expelled from
the lungs at an ordinary expiration, is a little less than one pint.
4th. Of the volume of air received by the lungs at one inspiration,
only one fourth part is decomposed at one action of the heart. 5th.
The quantity of blood that flows to the lungs, to be acted upon by the
air at one action of the heart, is two ounces, and this is acted on in
less than one second of time. 6th. The quantity of blood in the whole
body of the human adult, is twenty-five pounds avoirdupois, or twenty
pints. 7th. In the mutual action that takes place between the air and
blood, every twenty-four hours, the air loses thirty-seven ounces of
oxygen, and the blood fourteen ounces of carbon."

486. Apparently, atmospheric air is a simple element. But chemical
analysis shows its composition to be oxygen and nitrogen, in the
proportion of twenty-one parts of the former, and about seventy-nine
of the latter. In addition, there is a small amount of vapor of water
and carbonic acid. The pressure of this invisible, elastic fluid upon
the body of an ordinary sized adult, is estimated to equal thirty-five
thousand pounds.

487. The principal substance of a vitiated character in the
dark-colored blood is carbonic acid. And since there is no chemical
affinity between the oxygen and nitrogen of the air, the former
readily unites with some of the elements of the blood. Hence, whenever
blood is presented to the air in the lungs, the oxygen leaves the
nitrogen, and becomes mixed with the circulating fluid. (Appendix J.)

485. State the 1st, 2d, 3d, and 4th deductions from the experiments of
Dr. Southwood Smith. The 5th, 6th, and 7th. 486. Of what is
atmospheric air composed? What is the weight of air upon a common
sized man? 487. What is the principal substance of a vitiated
character in the dark-colored blood? What is said of the chemical
affinity between oxygen and nitrogen?

488. Again, carbonic acid and water have a stronger affinity for
atmospheric air than for the other elements of the blood. Consequently,
when they are brought into contact with the air in the lungs, the
carbonic acid and water leave the other constituents of the blood, and
unite with the air. In this way the bluish, or impure blood is
