feet because its orbit is smaller--but it revolves around the center in
the same time.

"Look," Jonner added, "I'll put it in round numbers. Figure your cable
as part of a radius of Phobos' orbit. Phobos travels at 1.32, but the
other end of the radius travels at zero because it's at the center. The
cable end, at the Martian surface, travels at a speed in
between--roughly 1,200 miles an hour--but it keeps up with Phobos'
revolution. Since the surface of Mars itself rotates at 500 miles an
hour, all I had to do was boost the plane up to 700 to match the speed
of the cable end.

"That cable will haul a hell of a lot more than twenty tons, and that's
all that's on it right now. By winching us up slowly, there'll never be
too great a strain on it."

Deveet looked apprehensively out of the port. The plane was hanging
sidewise now, and the distant Martian surface was straight out the
left-hand ports. The cable was holding.

"We can make the trip to Earth 83 days faster than the _Marsward_," said
Jonner, "and they have only about 20 days' start. It won't take us but a
few days to make Phobos and get this cable and the rest of the cargo
shot back to Mars. Atom-Star will get its franchise, and you'll see all
spaceships switching to the atomic drive within the next decade."

"How about this plane?" asked Deveet. "We stole it, you know."

"You can hire a G-boat to take it back to Marsport," said Jonner with a
chuckle. "Pay Mars-Air for the time and the broken ports, and settle out
of court with that pilot we dropped. I don't think they'll send you to
jail, Deveet."

He was silent for a few minutes.

"By the way, Deveet," said Jonner then, "radio Atom-Star to buy some
flonite cable of their own and ship it to Phobos. Damned if I don't
think this is cheaper than G-boats!"
