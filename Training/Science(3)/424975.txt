their tender morals to realize that a sane adult was willing to walk
around in brazen nakedness?

There was a pounding on the front door, and the voice of Millie inviting
the law into the house.

"Now I'm afraid you're due to go to jail," said Montcalm mournfully.
"But when they get some clothes on you, I'll try to explain it and get
you an audience with the mayor."

Two blue-clad policemen entered the room.

One policeman took the house dress from Montcalm's lax fingers and
tossed it over Liz' head without further ado.

Liz did not struggle. She looked at Montcalm with a quizzical
expression.

"I'm sorry," she said. "My people made a mistake. If you Earth people
aren't tolerant enough to accept a difference in customs of dress, I'm
afraid you're too immature."

With that, she was gone like a puff of air. The astonished policemen
held an empty dress.

Montcalm didn't see the flying saucer that whizzed over Traskmore that
morning and disappeared into the sky, but he didn't doubt the reports.
He debated with himself for a long time whether he had taken the right
attitude, but decided he had.

After all, there were the children to consider.
