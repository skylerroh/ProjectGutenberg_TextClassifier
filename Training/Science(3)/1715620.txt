matter since man's acquaintance with it. But it would be easy to
add any number of them, or change any lower into higher. That is the
[Page 263] meaning of the falling granite that becomes soil, of the
pulverized lava that decks the volcano's trembling sides with
flowers; that is the meaning of the grass becoming flesh, and of all
high forces constitutionally arranged for mastery over lower. Take
the ore from the mountain. It is loose, friable, worthless in
itself. Raise it in capacity to cast-iron, wrought-iron, steel, it
becomes a highway for the commerce of nations, over the mountains
and under them. It becomes bones, muscles, body for the inspiring
soul of steam. It holds up the airy bridge over the deep chasm. It
is obedient in your hand as blade, hammer, bar, or spring. It is
inspirable by electricity, and bears human hopes, fears, and loves
in its own bosom. It has been raised from valueless ore. Change it
again to something as far above steel as that is above ore. Change
all earthly ores to highest possibility; string them to finest
tissues, and the new result may fit God's hand as tools, and thrill
with his wisdom and creative processes, a body fitted for God's
spirit as well as the steel is fitted to your hand. From this world
take opacity, gravity, darkness, bring in more mind, love, and God,
and then we will have heaven. An immanent God makes a plastic world.

When man shall have mastered the forces that now exist, the original
Creator and Sustainer will say, "Behold, I create all things new."
Nature shall be called nearer to God, be more full of his power.
To the long-wandering AEneas, his divine mother sometimes came to
cheer his heart and to direct his steps. But the goddess only showed
herself divine by her departure; only when he stood in desolation
did the hero know he had [Page 264] stood face to face with divine
power, beauty, and love. Not so the Christian scholars, the
wanderers in Nature's bowers to-day. In the first dawn of discovery,
we see her full of beauty and strength; in closer communion, we find
her full of wisdom; to our perfect knowledge, she reveals an
indwelling God in her; to our ardent love, she reveals an indwelling
God in us.

But the evidence of the progressive refinements of habitation is no
more clear than that of progressive refinement of the inhabitant:
there must be some one to use these finer things. An empty house is
not God's ideal nor man's. The child may handle a toy, but a man
must mount a locomotive; and before there can be New Jerusalems
with golden streets, there must be men more avaricious of knowledge
than of gold, or they would dig them up; more zealous for love
than jewels, or they would unhang the pearly gates. The uplifting
refinement of the material world has been kept back until there
should appear masterful spirits able to handle the higher forces.
Doors have opened on every side to new realms of power, when men
have been able to wield them. If men lose that ability they close
again, and shut out the knowledge and light. Then ages, dark and
feeble, follow.

Some explore prophecy for the date of the grand transformation
of matter by the coming of the Son of Man, for a new creation. A
little study of nature would show that the date cannot be fixed.
A little study of Peter would show the same thing. He says, "What
manner of persons ought ye to be, in all holy conversation and
godliness, looking for and hastening the coming [Page 265] of the
day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved,
and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we,
according to his promise, look for a new heaven and a new earth."

The idea is, that the grand transformation of matter waits the
readiness of man. The kingdom waits the king. The scattered cantons
of Italy were only prostrate provinces till Victor Emanuel came,
then they were developed into united Italy. The prostrate provinces
of matter are not developed until the man is victor, able to rule
there a realm equal to ten cities here. Every good man hastens the
coming of the day of God and nature's renovation. Not only does
inference teach that there must be finer men, but fact affirms
that transformation has already taken place. Life is meant to have
power over chemical forces. It separates carbon from its compounds
and builds a tree, separates the elements and builds the body,
holds them separate until life withdraws. More life means higher
being. Certainly men can be refined and recapacitated as well as
ore. In Ovid's "Metamorphoses" he represents the lion in process of
formation from earth, hind quarters still clay, but fore quarters,
head, erect mane, and blazing eye--live lion--and pawing to get
free. We have seen winged spirits yet linked to forms of clay,
but beating the celestial air, endeavoring to be free; and we have
seen them, dowered with new sight, filled with new love, break
loose and rise to higher being.

In this grand apotheosis of man which nature teaches, progress
lias already been made. Man has already outgrown his harmony with
the environment of mere matter. He has given his hand to science, and
been lifted up above the earth into the voids of infinite space. He
[Page 266] has gone on and on, till thought, wearied amidst the
infinities of velocity and distance, has ceased to note them. But he
is not content; all his faculties are not filled. He feels that his
future self is in danger of not being satisfied with space, and
worlds, and all mental delights, even as his manhood fails to be
satisfied with the materiel toys of his babyhood. He asks for an
Author and Maker of things, infinitely above them. He has seen
wisdom unsearchable, power illimitable; but he asks for personal
sympathy and love. Paul expresses his feeling: every creature--not
the whole creation--groaneth and travaileth in pain together until
now, waiting for the adoption--the uplifting from orphanage to
parentage--a translation out of darkness into the kingdom of God's
dear Son. He hears that a man in Christ is a new creation: old
things pass away, all things become new. There is then a possibility
of finding the Author of nature, and the Father of man. He begins
his studies anew. Now he sees that all lines of knowledge converge
as they go out toward the infinite mystery; sees that these
converging lines are the reins of government in this world; sees the
converging lines grasped by an almighty hand; sees a loving face and
form behind; sees that these lines of knowledge and power are his
personal nerves, along which flashes his will, and every force in
the universe answers like a perfect muscle.

Then he asks if this Personality is as full of love as of power.
He is told of a tenderness too deep for tears, a love that has the
Cross for its symbol, and a dying cry for its expression: seeking
it, he is a new creation. He sees more wondrous things in the Word
than in the [Page 267] world. He comes to know God with his heart,
better than he knows God's works by his mind.

Every song closes with the key-note with which it began, and the
brief cadence at the close hints the realms of sound through which
it has tried its wings. The brief cadence at the close is this:
All force runs back into mind for its source, constant support,
and uplifts into higher grades.

Mr. Grove says, "Causation is the will, creation is the act, of God."
Creation is planned and inspired for the attainment of constantly
rising results. The order is chaos, light, worlds, vegetable forms,
animal life, then man. There is no reason to pause here. This is
not perfection, not even perpetuity. Original plans are not
accomplished, nor original force exhausted. In another world, free
from sickness, sorrow, pain, and death, perfection of abode is
offered. Perfection of inhabitant is necessary; and as the creative
power is everywhere present for the various uplifts and refinements
of matter, it is everywhere present with appropriate power for
the uplifting and refinement of mind and spirit.

SUMMARY OF LATEST DISCOVERIES AND CONCLUSIONS.

_Movements on the Sun._--The discovery and measurement of the up-rush,
down-rush, and whirl of currents about the sunspots, also of the
determination of the velocity of rotation by means of the spectroscope,
as described (page 53), is one of the most delicate and difficult
achievements of modern science.

_Movement of Stars in Line of Sight_ (page 51).--The following
table shows this movement of stars, so far as at present known:

 ---------------------------------------------------------------

_Sun's Appearance._--This was formerly supposed to be an even,
regular, dazzling brightness, except where the spots appeared.
But the sun's surface is now known to be mottled with what are
called rice grains or willow leaves. But the rice grains are as
large as the continent of America. The spaces between are called
pores. They constitute an innumerable number of small spots. This
appearance of the general surface is well portrayed in the cut
on page 92.

_Close Relation between Sun and Earth._-Men always knew that the
earth received light from the sun. They subsequently discovered
that the earth was momentarily held by the power [Page 270] of
gravitation. But it is a recent discovery that the light is one of
the principal agents in chemical changes, in molecular grouping and
world-building, thus making all kinds of life possible (p. 30-36).
The close connection of the sun and the earth will be still farther
shown in the relation of sun-spots and auroras. One of the most
significant instances is related on page 19, when the earth felt the
fall of bolides upon the sun. Members of the body no more answer to
the heart than the planets do to the sun.

_Hydrogen Flames._--It has been demonstrated that the sun flames
200,000 miles high are hydrogen in a state of flaming incandescence
(page 85).

_Sun's Distance._--The former estimate, 95,513,794 miles, has been
reduced by nearly one-thirtieth. Lockyer has stated it as low as
89,895,000 miles, and Proctor, in "Encyclopaedia Britannica," at
91,430,000 miles, but discovered errors show that these estimates
are too small. Newcomb gives 92,400,000 as within 200,000 miles
of the correct distance. The data for a new determination of this
distance, obtained from the transit of Venus, December 8th, 1874,
have not yet been deciphered; a fact that shows the difficulty
and laboriousness of the work. Meanwhile it begins to be evident
that observations of the transit of Venus do not afford the best
basis for the most perfect determination of the sun's distance.

Since the earth's distance is our astronomical unit of measure, it
follows that all other distances will be changed, when expressed
in miles, by this ascertained change of the value of the standard.

_Oxygen in the Sun._--In 1877 Professor Draper announced the discovery
of oxygen lines in the spectrum of the sun. The discovery was doubted,
and the methods used were criticised by Lockyer and others, but
later and more delicate experiments substantiate Professor Draper's
claim to the discovery. The elements known to exist in the sun
are salt, iron, hydrogen, [Page 271] magnesium, barium, copper,
zinc, cromium, and nickel. Some elements in the sun are scarcely, if
at all, discoverable on the earth, and some on the earth not yet
discernible in the sun.

_Substance of Stars._--Aldebaran (_Frontispiece_) shows salt, magnesium,
hydrogen, calcium, iron, bismuth, tellurium, antimony, and mercury.
Some of the sun's metals do not appear. Stars differ in their very
substance, and will, no doubt, introduce new elements to us unknown
before.

The theory that all nebulae are very distant clusters of stars is
utterly disproved by the clearest proof that some of them are only
incandescent gases of one or two kinds.

_Discoveries of New Bodies._--Vulcan, the planet nearest the sun
(page 138). The two satellites of Mars were discovered by Mr. Hall,
U. S. Naval Observatory, August 11th, 1877 (page 161). "The outer
one is called Diemas; the inner, Phobus.

Sir William Herschel thought he discovered six satellites of Uranus.
The existence of four of them has been disproved by the researches of
men with larger telescopes. Two new ones, however, were discovered
by Mr. Lassell in 1846.

_Saturn's Rings_ are proved to be in a state of fluidity and contraction
(page 171).

_Meteors and Comets._--The orbits of over one hundred swarms of
meteoric bodies are fixed: their relation to, and in some cases
indentity with, comets determined. Some comets are proved to be
masses of great weight and solidity (page 133).

_Aerolites._-Some have a texture like our lowest strata of rocks.
There is a geology of stars and meteors as well as of the earth. M.
Meunier has just received the Lalande Medal from the Paris Academy
for his treatise showing that, so far as our present knowledge can
determine, some of these meteors once belonged to a globe developed
in true geological epochs, and which has been separated into fragments
by agencies with which we are not acquainted.

[Illustration: Fig. 82.--Horizontal Pendulum.]

_The Horizontal Pendulum._--This delicate instrument is [Page 272]
represented in Fig. 82. It consists of an upright standard, strongly
braced; a weight, _m_, suspended by the hair-spring of a watch, B D,
and held in a horizontal position by another watch-spring, A C. The
weight is deflected from side to side by the slightest influence.
The least change in the level of a base thirty-nine inches long that
could be detected by a spirit-level is 0".1 of an arc--equal to
raising one end 1/2068 of an inch. But the pendulum detects a
raising of one end 1/36000000 of an inch. To observe the movements
of the pendulum, it is kept in a dark room, and a ray of light is
directed to the mirror, _m_, and thence reflected upon a screen.
Thus the least movement may be enormously magnified, and read and
measured by the moving spot on the screen. It has been discovered
that when the sun rises it has sufficient attraction to incline this
instrument to the east; when it sets, to incline it to the west. The
same is true of the moon. When either is exactly overhead or
underfoot, of course there is no deflection. The mean deflection
caused by the moon at rising or setting is 0".0174; by the sun,
0".008. Great results are expected from this instrument hardly known
as yet: among others, whether gravitation acts instantly or consumes
time in coming from the sun. This will be shown by the time of the
change of the pendulum from east to west when the sun reaches the
zenith, and _vice versa_ when it crosses the nadir. The sun will be
best studied without light, in the quiet and darkness of some deep
mine.

[Page 273]
_Light of Unseen Stars._--From careful examination, it appears
that three-fourths of the light on a fine starlight night comes
from stars that cannot be discerned by the naked eye. The whole
amount of star light is about one-eightieth of that of the full
moon.

_Lateral Movements of Stars_, page 226-28.

_Future Discoveries_--_A Trans-Neptunian Planet._--Professor Asaph
Hall says: "It is known to me that at least two American astronomers,
armed with powerful telescopes, have been searching quite recently for
a trans-Neptunian planet. These searches have been caused by the fact
that Professor Newcomb's tables of Uranus and Neptune already begin
to differ from observation. But are we to infer from these errors of
the planetary tables the existence of a trans-Neptunian planet? It
is possible that such a planet may exist, but the probability is, I
think, that the differences are caused by errors in the theories of
these planets. * * * A few years ago the remark was frequently made
that the labors of astronomers on the solar system were finished, and
that henceforth they could turn their whole attention to sidereal
astronomy. But to-day we have the lunar theory in a very discouraging
condition, and the theories of Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
and Neptune all in need of revision; unless, indeed, Leverrier's
theories of the last two planets shall stand the test of observation.
But, after all, such a condition of things is only the natural
result of long and accurate series of observations, which make
evident the small inequalities in the motions, and bring to light
the errors of theory."

Future discoveries will mostly reveal the laws and conditions of
the higher and finer forces. Already Professor Loomis telegraphs
twenty miles without wire, by the electric currents between mountains.
We begin to use electricity for light, and feel after it for a
motor. Comets and Auroras show its presence between worlds, and
in the interstellar spaces. Let another Newton arise.
