Comparisons: The red cedar is apt to be confused with the _low juniper_
    (_Juniperus communis_) which grows in open fields all over the
    world. The latter, however, is generally of a low form with a flat
    top. Its leaves are pointed and prickly, never scale-like, and they
    are whitish above and green below. Its bark shreds and its fruit is
    a small round berry of agreeable aromatic odor.


ARBOR-VITAE; NORTHERN WHITE CEDAR (_Thuja occidentalis_)

Distinguishing characters: The *branchlets* are extremely *flat and
    fan-like*, Fig. 13, and have an agreeable _aromatic odor_ when
    bruised. The tree is an evergreen with a _narrow conical form_.

[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Twig of the Arbor-vitae.]

Leaf: Leaves of two kinds, one scale-like and flat, the other keeled,
    all tightly pressed to the twig (see Fig. 13).

Form and size: A close, conical head with dense foliage near the base.
    Usually a small tree, but in some parts of the northeastern States
    it grows to medium size with a diameter of two feet.

Range: Northern part of North America.

Soil and location: Inhabits low, swampy lands; in the State of Maine
    often forming thick forests.

Enemies: Very seldom affected by insects.

Value for planting: Is hardy in New England, where it is especially used
    for hedges. It is also frequently used as a specimen tree on the
    lawn.

Commercial value: The wood is durable for posts, ties, and shingles. The
    bark contains considerable tannin and the juices from the tree have
    a medicinal value.

Other characters: The _fruit_ is a cone about 1/2 inch long.

Other common names: Arbor-vitae is sometimes called _white cedar_ and
    _cedar_.

Comparisons: The arbor-vitae is apt to be confused with the true _white
    cedar_ (_Chamaecyparis thyoides_) but the leaves of the latter are
    sharp-pointed and not flattened or fan-shaped.

HOW TO IDENTIFY TREES--(Continued)



GROUP IV. THE LARCH AND CYPRESS

How to tell them from other trees: In summer the larch and cypress may
    easily be told from other trees by their _leaves_. These are
    needle-shaped and arranged in clusters with numerous leaves to each
    cluster in the case of the larch, and feathery and flat in the case
    of the cypress. In winter, when their leaves have dropped off, the
    trees can be told by their cones, which adhere to the branches.

    There are nine recognized species of larch and two of bald cypress.
    The larch is characteristically a northern tree, growing in the
    northern and mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere from the
    Arctic circle to Pennsylvania in the New World, and in Central
    Europe, Asia, and Japan in the Old World. It forms large forests in
    the Alps of Switzerland and France.

    The European larch and not the American is the principal species
    considered here, because it is being planted extensively in this
    country and in most respects is preferable to the American species.

    The bald cypress is a southern tree of ancient origin, the
    well-known cypress of Montezuma in the gardens of Chepultepec having
    been a species of Taxodium. The tree is now confined to the swamps
    and river banks of the South Atlantic and Gulf States, where it
    often forms extensive forests to the exclusion of all other trees.
    In those regions along the river swamps, the trees are often
    submerged for several months of the year.

How to tell them from each other: In summer the larch may be told from
    the cypress by its leaves (compare Figs. 14 and 16). In winter the
    two can be distinguished by their characteristic forms. The larch is
    a broader tree as compared with the cypress and its form is more
    conical. The cypress is more slender and it is taller. The two have
    been grouped together in this study because they are both coniferous
    trees and, unlike the other Conifers, are both deciduous, their
    leaves falling in October.

[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Twig of the Larch in Summer.]


THE EUROPEAN LARCH (_Larix europaea_)

Distinguishing characters: Its leaves, which are needle-shaped and about
    an inch long, are borne in *clusters* close to the twig, Fig. 14.
    There are many leaves to each cluster. This characteristic together
    with the *spire-like* form of the crown will distinguish the tree at
    a glance.

Leaf: The leaves are of a light-green color but become darker in the
    spring and in October turn yellow and drop off. The cypress, which
    is described below, is another cone-bearing tree which sheds its
    leaves in winter.

[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Twig of the Larch in Winter.]

Form and size: A medium-sized tree with a conical head and a straight
    and tapering trunk. (See Fig. 90.)

Range: Central Europe and eastern and central United States.

Soil and location: Requires a deep, fresh, well-drained soil and needs
    plenty of light. It flourishes in places where our native species
    would die. Grows very rapidly.

Enemies: The larch is subject to the attacks of a _sawfly_, which has
    killed many trees of the American species. A _fungus_ (_Trametes
    pini_) which causes the tree to break down with ease is another of
    its enemies.

Value for planting: A well-formed tree for the lawn. It is also useful
    for group planting in the forest.

Commercial value: Because its wood is strong and durable the larch is
    valuable for poles, posts, railroad ties, and in shipbuilding.

[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Twig of the Cypress.]

Other characters: The _fruit_ is a small cone about one inch long,
    adhering to the tree throughout the winter.

[Illustration: FIG. 17.--The Bald Cypress.]

Comparisons: The tree is apt to be confused with the _American larch_,
    also known as _tamarack_ and _hackmatack_, but differs from it in
    having longer leaves, cones twice as large and more abundant and
    branches which are more pendulous.

    The larch differs from the bald cypress in the broader form of its
    crown and the cluster-like arrangement of its leaves. The twigs of
    the bald cypress are flat and feathery. The larch and bald cypress
    have the common characteristics of both shedding their leaves in
    winter and preferring to grow in moist or swampy soils. The larch,
    especially the native species, forms the well-known tamarack swamps
    of the north. The bald cypress grows in a similar way in groups in
    the southern swamps.


BALD CYPRESS (_Taxodium distichum_)

Distinguishing characters: The *feathery character* of the *twigs*, Fig.
    16, and the *spire-like form* of the tree, Fig. 17, which is taller
    and more slender than the larch, will distinguish this species from
    others.

[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Cypress "Knees."]

Leaf: The leaves drop off in October, though the tree is of the
    cone-bearing kind. In this respect it is like the larch.

Form and size: Tall and pyramidal.

Range: The cypress is a southern tree, but is found under cultivation in
    parks and on lawns in northern United States.

Soil and location: Grows naturally in swamps, but will also do well in
    ordinary well-drained, good soil. In its natural habitat it sends
    out special roots above water. These are known as "_cypress knees_"
    (Fig. 18) and serve to provide air to the submerged roots of the
    tree.

Enemies: None of importance.

Value for planting: An excellent tree for park and lawn planting.

Commercial value: The wood is light, soft, and easily worked. It is used
    for general construction, interior finish, railroad ties, posts and
    cooperage.

Other characters: The _bark_ is thin and scaly. The _fruit_ is a cone
    about an inch in diameter. The general _color_ of the tree is a
    dull, deep green which, however, turns orange brown in the fall.

Comparisons: The cypress and the larch are apt to be confused,
    especially in the winter, when the leaves of both have dropped. The
    cypress is more slender and is taller in form. The leaves of each
    are very different, as will be seen from the accompanying
    illustrations.



GROUP V. THE HORSECHESTNUT, ASH AND MAPLE

How to tell them from other trees: The horsechestnut, ash, and maple
    have their branches and buds arranged on their stems *opposite* each
    other as shown in Figs. 20, 22 and 24. In other trees, this
    arrangement is *alternate*, as shown in Fig. 19.

How to tell these three from each other. If the bud is large--an inch to
    an inch and a half long--dark brown, and _sticky_, it is a
    _horsechestnut_.

    If the bud is _not sticky_, much smaller, and _rusty brown to black_
    in color, and the ultimate twigs, of an olive green color, are
    _flattened_ at points below the buds, it is an _ash_.

[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Alternate Branching (Beech.)]

    If it is not a horsechestnut nor an ash and its small buds have
    many scales covering them, the specimen with branches and buds
    opposite must then be a _maple_. Each of the maples has one
    character which distinguishes it from all the other maples. For the
    sugar maple, this distinguishing character is the _sharp point of
    the bud_. For the silver maple it is the _bend in the terminal
    twig_. For the red maple it is the _smooth gray-colored bark_. For
    the Norway maple it is the _reddish brown color of the full, round
    bud_, and for the box elder it is the _greenish color of its
    terminal twig_.

    The form of the tree and the leaves are also characteristic in each
    of the maples, but for the beginner who does not wish to be burdened
    with too many of these facts at one time, those just enumerated
    will be found most certain and most easily followed.

[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Opposite Branching (Horsechestnut.)]


THE HORSECHESTNUT
(_Aesculus hippocastanum_)

Distinguishing characters: The *sticky* nature of the *terminal bud* and
    its *large size* (about an inch long). The bud is dark brown in
    color. See Fig. 20.

Leaf: Five to seven leaflets, usually seven. Fig. 21.

Form and size: Medium-sized tree, pyramidal head and coarse twigs.

Range: Europe and eastern United States.

Soil and location: Prefers a deep, rich soil.

Enemies: The leaves are the favorite food of caterpillars and are
    subject to a blight which turns them brown prematurely. The trunk is
    often attacked by a disease which causes the flow of a slimy
    substance.

Value for planting: On account of its showy flowers, the horsechestnut
    is a favorite for the park and lawn.

Commercial value: The wood is not durable and is not used commercially.

Other characters: The _flowers_ appear in large white clusters in May
    and June. The _fruit_ is large, round, and prickly.

[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Leaf of the Horsechestnut.]

Comparisons: The _red horsechestnut_ differs from this tree in having
    red flowers. The _buckeye_ is similar to the horsechestnut, but its
    bud is not sticky and is of a lighter gray color, while the leaf
    generally has only five leaflets.


THE WHITE ASH (_Fraxinus americana_)

Distinguishing characters: The terminal *twigs* of glossy olive green
    color are *flattened* below the bud. Fig. 22. The bud is
    rusty-brown.

[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Twig of White Ash.]

Leaf: Five to nine leaflets. Fig. 23.

Form and size: A large tree with a straight trunk.

Range: Eastern North America.

Soil and location: Rich, moist soil.

Enemies: In cities it is very often attacked by sucking insects.

Value for planting: The white ash grows rapidly. On account of its
    insect enemies in cities, it should be used more for forest planting
    and only occasionally for ornament.

Commercial value: It has a heavy, tough, and strong wood, which is
    valuable in the manufacture of cooperage stock, agricultural
    implements, and carriages. It is superior in value to the black ash.

Other characters: The _bark_ is gray. The _flowers_ appear in May.

Comparisons: The white ash is apt to be confused with the _black ash_
    (_Fraxinus nigra_), but differs from the latter in having a
    lighter-colored bud. The bud of the black ash is black. The bark of
    the white ash is darker in color and the terminal twigs are more
    flattened than those of the black ash.

[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Leaf of White Ash.]


SUGAR MAPLE (_Acer saccharum_)

Distinguishing characters: The *bud is sharp-pointed*, scaly, and
    reddish brown. Fig. 24.

[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Twig of the Sugar Maple.]

Leaf: Has sharp points and round sinus. Fig. 25.

Form and size: The crown is oval when the tree is young and round in old
    age. Fig. 26.

Range: Eastern United States.

Soil and location: Moist and deep soil, and cool, shady positions.

Enemies: Subject to drouth, especially in cities. Is attacked by the
    _sugar maple borer_ and the _maple phenacoccus_, a sucking insect.
