to tell them of these things. I wanted to tell them how they must work
ever toward that future time of wonder.

"But they did not listen. Before I had spoken minutes to them they cried
out on me as a sorcerer and a blasphemer, and seized me and brought me
here to the Inquisitor, to you, sire. And to you, sire, I have told the
truth in all things. I know that in doing so I have set the seal of my
own fate, and that only a sorcerer would ever tell such a tale, yet
despite that I am glad. Glad that I have told one at least of this time
of what I saw five centuries in the future. Glad that I saw! Glad that I
saw the things that someday, sometime, must come to be--"

It was a week later that they burned Henri Lothiere. Jean de Marselait,
lifting his gaze from his endless parchment accusation and examens on
that afternoon, looked out through the window at a thick curl of black
smoke going up from the distant square.

"Strange, that one," he mused. "A sorcerer, of course, but such a one as
I had never heard before. I wonder," he half-whispered, "was there any
truth in that wild tale of his? The future--who can say--what men might
do--?"

There was silence in the room as he brooded for a moment, and then he
shook himself as one ridding himself of absurd speculations. "But
tush--enough of these crazy fancies. They will have me for a sorcerer if
I yield to these wild fancies and visions _of the future_."

And bending again with his pen to the parchment before him, he went
gravely on with his work.
