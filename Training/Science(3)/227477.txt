Motion from clock to polar axis is transmitted by means of a set of bevel
gears and worm and worm wheel. The worm wheel is held by friction to the
polar axis so that the telescope can be moved without loosening any screw
and without affecting the clock. The clock will give steady and accurate
motion to the telescope and with ordinary care it will keep in good repair
for years. A slow motion adjustment independent of the clock is fitted to
the polar axis.

With the instrument are furnished three celestial eye pieces giving a
magnifying power of about 50, 100 and 150 diameters respectively.

The instrument is easily portable, the total weight of a 3" telescope being
about 60 lbs. yet it is made heavy enough, and the material well
distributed to insure strength and steadiness. Workmanship and finish of
the instrument are the best. The brass parts are either lacquered yellow or
bronzed. The iron parts are durably enameled and all exposed steel parts
are nickel-plated.

EQUATORIAL MOUNTINGS ON IRON PILLAR WITH DRIVING CLOCK, ETC.


On page 10 is shown an illustration of our standard high grade type of 6
in. equatorial. A description of the same will apply to practically all
larger and smaller sizes.

The pillar is of rectangular cross section and well proportioned. The clock
case is securely fastened to the top of the pillar but with provision for
adjustment in azimuth. The clock has ample driving power, is very carefully
constructed and regulated by friction governor (Design Prof. Young.)
Maintaining gears are provided on the main shaft which allows the winding
of the clock without retarding motion. Worm wheel and worm are carefully
cut, and protected by brass shields. Right ascension and declination
circles have fine graduation on solid silver and coarse finding graduation
on the edge. Electric illumination and magnifying glasses are fitted to the
verniers. The handles for all clamps and slow motions are fastened
conveniently near the eye end of the telescope and are of different shape
so as to distinguish in the dark right ascension and declination. The axes
are of tool steel carefully fitted to their bearings, and on the larger
instruments friction rollers are fitted to the polar axis. The telescope
tube is made of steel, light but strongly constructed. The eye end has long
and heavy rack and pinion motion and the whole can be easily removed.

#Note.#--The fine divided circles are often omitted on smaller equatorials,
as they are not essential, the electrical illumination for the circles is
also left off, and this will amount to a material saving.

give prices on application.

The above cut shows a driving clock for our standard 6 in. telescope.

We have constructed clocks for a number of larger telescopes among others
the clock for the 24 in. Lowell Refractor.
