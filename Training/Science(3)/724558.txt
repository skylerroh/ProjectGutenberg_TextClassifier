know we're here. But we won't be able to convince anyone else of it.
And, these last few years, the war seems to have been slowing down
again. In the past, that's always meant the Geests were preparing a big
new surprise operation.

"So the other thing now--the business of getting off Roye. It can't be
done unless some of you have made prior arrangements for it Earthside.
If it had been possible in any other way, I'd have been out of this
place ten years ago."

Ronald Black said carefully, "Very unfortunately, Boles, no such
arrangements have been made."

"Then there it is," Phil said. "I suppose you see now why I thought this
group should get together. The ten masterminds! Well, we've hoaxed
ourselves into a massive jam. Now let's find out if there's any possible
way--_any possibility at all!_--of getting out of it again."

A voice spoke tinnily from Jackson's lapel communicator. "Major
Jackson?"

"Yes?" Jackson said.

"Please persuade Miss Adams that it is no longer necessary to point her
gun at this car. In view of the stated emergency, we feel we had better
come out now--and join the conference."

FROM THE RECORDS OF THE TERRITORIAL OFFICE, 2345 A.D.

... It is generally acknowledged that the Campaign of the 132nd Segment
marked the turning point of the Geest War. Following the retransfer of
Colonel Silas Thayer to Earth, the inspired leadership of Major Wayne
Jackson and his indefatigable and exceptionally able assistants, notably
CLU President Boles, transformed the technically unfortified and thinly
settled key world of Roye within twelve years into a virtual death trap
for any invading force. Almost half of the Geest fleet which eventually
arrived there was destroyed in the first week subsequent to the landing,
and few of the remaining ships were sufficiently undamaged to be able to
lift again. The enemy relief fleet, comprising an estimated forty per
cent of the surviving Geest space power, was intercepted in the 134th
Segment by the combined Earth forces under Admiral McKenna's command and
virtually annihilated.

In the following two years ...
