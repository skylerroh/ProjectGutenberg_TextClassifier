weight, as before. Should any Zn or other solid substance be
left, pour off the water or filter it, weigh the dry residue, and
deduct its weight from that of the Zn originally taken. Suppose
the residue to weigh 0.5g. Make and solve the proportion from the
equation:-


Zn + 2HCl = ZnCl2 + 2H.
65 	             2.
4.5	             x.


Compute the percentage of errcr, as in the case of O. If the
purity of the HCl be known, i.e. the weight of HCl gas in one
cubic centimeter of the liquid, a proportion can be made between
HCl and H, provided no free HCl is left in the flask. State any
liabilities to error in this experiment.

PROBLEMS.

(1) A gas occupies 2000cc.when the barometer stands
750mm. What volume will it fill at 760mm?

(2) At 750mm my volume of O is 4 1/2 liters. What will it be at
730mm?

(3) At 825mm?

(4) At 200mm?

(5) Compute the volume of a gas at 70 degrees, which at 30
degrees is 150cc.

(6) At 0 degrees I have 3000cc.of O. What volume will it occupy
at 100 degrees?

(7) I fill a flask holding 2 litres with H. The thermometer
indicates 26 degrees, the barometer 762mm. What is the volume of
the gas at 0 degrees and 760mm?

If the volumes of gases vary as above, it is evident that their
vapor densities must vary inversely. A liter of H at 0 degrees
weighs 0.0896. What will a liter of H weigh at 273 degrees? At
273 degrees the one liter has be- come two liters, one of which
weighs 0.0448 (= 0.0896 / 2). The vapor density of a gas is
inversely proportional to the temperature. Also, the vapor
density is directly proportional to the pressure, since a liter
of any gas under a pressure of one atmosphere is reduced to half
a liter under two atmospheres.

PROBLEMS.

(1) Find the weight of a liter of O at 0 degrees; then compute the
weight of a liter at 27  degrees.

(2) Find the weight of 500cc.of N2O at 60 degrees.

(3) Of 200 cc. of CO at -5 degrees.

(4) A given volume of O weighs 0.25g at a pressure of 750mm; find
the weight of a like volume of O at 758mm.

TEXTBOOK ADVERTISEMENTS THAT APPEARED IN THE ORIGINAL EDITION



INTRODUCTION TO CHEMICAL SCIENCE

By R.P. WILLIAMS, Instructor in Chemistry in the English High
School, Boston. l2mo. Cloth. 216 pages. By mail, 90 cents; for
introduction, 80 cents.

This work is strictly, but easily, inductive. The pupil is
stimulated by query and suggestion to observe important
phenomena, and to draw correct conclusions. The experiments are
illustrative, the apparatus is simple and easily made. The
nomenclature, symbols, and writing of equations are made
prominent features. In descriptive and theoretical chemistry, the
arrangement of subjects is believed to be especially superior in
that it presents, not a mere aggregation of facts, but the
science of chemistry. Brevity aud concentration, induction,
clearness, accuracy, and a legitimate regard for interest, are
leading characteristics. The treatment is full enough for any
high school or academy.

Though the method is an advanced one, it has been so simplified
that pupils experience no difficulty, but rather an added
interest, in following it.

The author himself has successfully employed this method in
classes so large that the simplest and most practical plan has
been a necessity.

Thomas C. Van Nuys, Professor of Chemistry, Indiana University,
Bloomington, Ind.:

"I consider it an excellent work for students entering upon the
study of chemistry."

C.F. Adams, Teacher of Science, High School, Detroit, Mich.:

"I have carried two classes through Williams's Chemistry. The
book has surpassed my highest expectations. It gives greater
satisfaction with each succeeding class."

J.W. Simmons, County Superintendent of Schools, Owosso, Mich.:

"The proof of the merits of a textbook, is found in the crucible
of the class-room work. There are many chemistries, and good
ones; but, for our use, this leads them all. It is stated in
language plain, interesting and not misleading. A logical order
is followed, and the mind of the student is at work because of
the many suggestions offered. We use Williams's work, and the
results are all we could wish. There is plenty of chemistry in
the work for any of our high schools."

W.J. Martin, Professor of Chemistry, Davidson College, N.C.:

"One of the most admirable little text-books I have ever seen."

T.H. Norton, Projessor of Chemistry, Cincinnati University, O.:

"Its clearness, accuracy, and compact form render it
exceptionally well adapted for use in high and preparatory
schools. I shall warmly recommend it for use, whenever the effort
is made to provide satisfactory training in accordance with the
requirements for admission to the scientific courses of the
University."


CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS


General and Analytical. By R.P. WILLIAMS, Instructor in
Chemistry, English High School, Boston. 8vo. Boards. xv + 212
pages. Fully illustrated. Mailing price, 60 cents; for
introduction, 50 cents.

This book is for the use of students in the chemical laboratory.
It contains more than one hundred sets of the choicest
illustrative experiments, about half of which belong to General
Chemistry, the rest to Metal and Acid Analysis.

Great care has been taken to describe accurately and minutely the
methods of performing experiments, and in directing pupils to
observe phenomena and to explain what is seen. The work is amply
illustrated and is replete with questions and suggestions. Blank
pages are inserted for pupils to make a record of their work, for
which careful directions are given, with a model, laboratory
rules, tables of solubilities, etc.

A new feature is the supplementary and original work, vhich is
given at the end of each set of experiments for such pupils as
complete the prescribed work ahead of others in the class, and a
list of terms to be looked up in some text-book. This gives an
elasticity to the book and fits it for use in schools where much
time is devoted to chemistry, as well as in the most elementary
classes in labortttory work.

Another original feature which it is believed will be heartily
welcomed by teachers is the method of treating Metal Analysis
successfully used by the author for several years.

Briefly, the aim of this book is to aid the pupil to do, to
observe, to explain, to record, aud thus to learn the essentials
of chemistry.
