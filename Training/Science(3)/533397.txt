fragmentation, are distinguished. One of the goals of this research is
to learn more about the constitution of the nucleus and of the forces
which bind the particles in the interior of the nucleus.

FOOTNOTES:

[7] Mesons are elementary particles intermediate in mass between the
electron and proton.

[8] It may be interesting to note that the [pi]^0 meson was discovered
with this cyclotron in 1950. This was the first particle to be
discovered with an accelerator. All particles that had been previously
discovered were observed first in cosmic rays or some other form of
natural radiation.
