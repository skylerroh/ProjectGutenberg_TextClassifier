
THE PRESERVATION OF TIMBER.

[Footnote: From the Transactions of the Society.]

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS ON
THE PRESERVATION OF TIMBER, PRESENTED AND ACCEPTED AT THE ANNUAL
CONVENTION, JUNE 25, 1885.

BOUCHERIE, OR SULPHATE OF COPPER.


The name of Dr. Boucherie is generally applied to the _process_, which
he invented and extensively applied, of preparing wood by forcing a
solution longitudinally through the pores of the wood by means of
hydraulic pressure. As, however, he also patented the use of sulphate of
copper, and his name became attached to the use of that antiseptic, it
will be convenient here to classify experiments made with that substance
under this head.

Dr. Boucherie was a distinguished French chemist, who between 1836 and
1846 made many elaborate researches and experiments upon the
preservation of timber. He tried many substances, and at first
recommended the use of pyrolignite of iron, but subsequently used
sulphate of copper, which he considered more effective.

His first experiments were conducted by vital suction, that is, by
tapping the living tree, and allowing the ascending sap to carry up a
preserving solution. This was not found to give uniform or satisfactory
results, and Dr. Boucherie then invented the process which bears his
name. This was practiced either by applying a cap to the end of a
freshly cut log, through which the solution was allowed to flow by
pressure, or by sawing a log nearly through in the middle, raising it at
the center slightly, so as to open the joint, placing a strip of tarred
rope or a rubber band just inside the periphery of the cut log, and
letting it spring back, so as to form a tight joint by pressing upon the
rope or band. An auger hole bored diagonally into the cavity so formed
then served to admit the solution under pressure.

This process, applied with a solution of about one pound of sulphate of
copper to one hundred pounds of water, has been extensively applied in
France for many years, with satisfactory results. It was found, however,
that to be successful it must be applied to freshly cut trees in the log
only, and that this involved so much delay, moving about, waste, and
annoyance, that it has now been abandoned. These difficulties would be
still greater in this country, and in the Northern States the process
could not be applied at all during the winter (or season for cutting
down trees), as the solution would freeze.

On this page is a list of the experiments which your committee have been
able to learn about, as having been made with sulphate of copper in this
country.

COMMENTS ON SULPHATE OF COPPER EXPERIMENTS.

The first experiment was carried out by Mr. W.W. Evans, on the Southern
Railway of Chili, in 1857, and he informs your committee that in 1860,
when he left that country, the ties were still good and in serviceable
condition.

We give herewith, in Appendix No. 16, an interesting letter from Mr. E.
Pontzen to Mr. Evans, on the subject of the Boucherie process.

Experiments Nos. 2 to 16, inclusive, were all tried with various
modifications of the sulphate of copper process as introduced by Mr. W.
Thilmany in this country. They date back to 1870 (experiment No. 2),
when Mr. Thilmany was working and recommending the methods of vital
suction and of the Boucherie hydraulic pressure system. After describing
the foreign methods of injection with sulphate of copper, he states in
his first pamphlet (1870): "This process resulted very satisfactorily,
but it was found that the sulphate of copper became very much diluted by
the sap, and when the same liquid was used several times, the decaying
substance of the sap, viz., the albumen, was reintroduced into the wood,
and left it nearly in its primitive condition."

He accordingly proposed a double injection, first by muriate of barytes,
and, secondly, by sulphate of copper, forced through by the Boucherie
process, and it is presumed that the ties of 1870, in experiment No. 2,
which showed favorable results when examined in 1875, were prepared by
that process.

Subsequently Mr. Thilmany changed his mode of application to the Bethell
process of injecting solutions under pressure in closed cylinders, and
probably the paving blocks for experiment No. 3 were prepared in that
way. The chemical examination of them by Mr. Tilden, however, showed the
"saturation very uneven; absorptive power, high; block contains soluble
salts of copper, removable by washing."

It was expected that the double solution, by forming an insoluble
compound, would prove an effective protection against the _teredo_.
Experiments Nos. 4, 5, 6, and 8, however, proved the contrary to be the
fact.

The process, when well done, gave moderately satisfactory results
against decay. A pavement laid in the yard of the Schlitz Brewing
Company, in Milwaukee (experiment No. 7), was sound in 1882, after some
six years' exposure. A report by Mr. J.F. Babcock, a chemist of Boston
(experiment No. 9), indicated favorable results, and the planks in a
ropewalk at Charlestown (experiment No. 15), laid in 1879, were yet
sound in 1882.

The experiments on railroad ties (Nos. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 16),
however, did not result satisfactorily. They seemed favorable at first,
and great things were expected of them; but late examinations made on
the Wabash Railroad, on the New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, and on the
Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad, have shown the ties to be decaying,
and the results to be unfavorable.

This applies to the sulphate of copper and barium process. Mr. Thilmany
has patented still another combination, in which he uses sulphate of
zinc and chloride of barium, which has been noticed under the head of
burnettizing.

Experiment No. 17 was tried on the Hudson River Railroad. It consisted
of 1,000 sap pine ties, which had been impregnated in the South, by the
Boucherie process, with a mixture of sulphate of iron and sulphate of
copper, under Hamar's patent. These ties were laid in the tunnel at New
Hamburg, a trying exposure, and when examined, in 1882, several of them
were still in the track. The process, however, was found to be so
tedious that it was abandoned after a year's trial, and has not since
been resumed.

In 1882 Mr. H. Fladd, of St. Louis, patented a method which is the
inverse of the Boucherie process (experiment No. 18). To the cap
fastened to the end of a freshly cut log he applies a suction pump, and
placing the other end into a vat, filled with the desired solution, he
sucks up the preserving fluid through the pores or sap cells of the
wood.

Quite a number of experimental ties have been prepared in this way, with
various chemical solutions, chief of which was sulphate of copper, and
there is probably no question but that the life of the wood will be
materially increased thereby.

Whether the process will prove more convenient and economical than the
original Boucherie process can only be determined by practical
application upon an extensive scale.

A considerable number of modifications and appliances for working the
Boucherie process have been patented in this country; but none of them
seems to have come into practical use, probably because of the necessity
for operating upon freshly cut logs, and the inconvenience of such
applications.

The table on this page gives a record of various experiments with
miscellaneous substances.

COMMENTS ON MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIMENTS.

Experiments Nos. 1, 2, and 3 relate to the Earle process, from which
great results were expected from 1839 to 1844. It consisted in immersing
timber, rope, canvas, etc., in a hot solution of one pound of sulphate
of copper and three pounds of sulphate of iron mixed in twenty gallons
of water. It was first tested on some hemlock paving blocks on Chestnut
Street, Philadelphia, and for a time seemed to promise good results.
Experiments with prepared rope, exposed in a fungus pit, by Mr. James
Archbald, Chief Engineer of the Delaware and Hudson Canal, seemed also
favorable.

The process was, therefore, thoroughly tried at the Watervliet Arsenal,
where it was applied to some 63,000 cubic ft. of timber, at a cost of
about seven cents per cubic foot. The timber was used for various
ordnance purposes, and while it was found to have its life extended, as
would naturally be expected from the known character of the antiseptics
used, its strength was so far impaired, and it checked and warped so
badly, that the process was abandoned in 1844.

The committee is indebted to General S.V. Benet, Chief of Ordnance, for
a full copy of the reports upon these experiments.

Experiments Nos. 4 and 7 represent the lime process, which has been
applied to a considerable extent in France. The fact that platforms and
boxes used for mixing lime mortar seem to resist decay has repeatedly
suggested the use of lime for preserving timber. In 1840 Mr. W.R.
Huffnagle, Engineer of the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad, laid a
portion of its track on white pine sills, which had been soaked for
three months in a vat of lime-water as strong as could be maintained.
Similar experiments were tried on the Baltimore and Ohio in 1850. The
result was not satisfactory, as might be expected from the fact that
lime is a comparatively weak antiseptic (52.5 by atomic weight, while
creosote is 216), and from the extreme tediousness of three months'
soaking.

Experiments Nos. 5 and 8 were tried with sulphate of iron, sometimes
known as payenizing, and the particulars of the former have been
furnished by Mr. I. Hinckley, President of the Philadelphia, Wilmington,
and Baltimore Railroad, to whom your committee is much indebted for a
large mass of information on the subject of timber preservation.

Mr. Hinckley has had longer and more varied experience on this subject
than any other person in this country. Beginning with sulphate of copper
in 1846, following with chloride of mercury in 1847, and chloride of
zinc in 1852, going back to chloride of mercury, and again to chloride
of zinc, using the latter until 1865, then using creosote to protect the
piles against the _teredo_ at Taunton Great River (experiment No. 2.
creosoting), he has had millions of feet of timber and lumber prepared
by the various processes, and has kindly placed at our disposal many
original reports in manuscript and pamphlets which are now very rare.

Experiment No. 6 was made by Mr. Ashbel Welch, former President of this
Society, and consisted in boring hemlock track sills 6 x 12 with a 1-1/8
inch auger-hole 10 inches deep every 15 inches. These were filled with
common salt and plugged up, as is not infrequently done in
ship-building, but while the life of the timber was somewhat lengthened,
it was concluded that the process did not pay.

Salt has been experimented with numberless times. It is cheap, but is a
comparatively weak antiseptic, its atomic weight being 58.8 in the
hydrogen scale, as against 135.5 for chloride of mercury.

Experiment No. 9 is included in order to notice the well-known and most
ancient process of charring the outside of timber. In this particular
case, the fence posts after charring were dipped for about three feet
into a hot mixture of raw linseed oil and pulverized charcoal, which
probably acted by closing the sap cells against the intrusion of
moisture, which, as is well known, much hastens decay. The posts, which
had been set butt-end upward, were mostly sound in 1879, after 24 years'
exposure.

Experiments Nos. 41, 42, 43, and 44 did not, however, result as well,
and numberless failures throughout the country attest that charring is
uncertain and disappointing in its results.

Much ingenuity has been wasted in devising and patenting machinery for
charring wood on a large scale to preserve it against decay. The
process, however, is so tedious in comparison with the benefits which it
confers, and the charred surface is so objectionable for many uses, that
nothing is to be expected from the process upon a large commercial
scale.

In 1857-58 Mr. H.K. Nichols tried sundry experiments (No. 10), at
Pottsville, Pa., upon timber which he endeavored to impregnate with
pyrolignite of iron by means of capillary action. Similar experiments
had previously been thoroughly tried in France by Dr. Boucherie, but the
result has not been found satisfactory.

In 1858 the Erie Railway purchased the right of using the Nichols
patent, and erected machinery at its Owego Bridge shop for boring a 2
inch hole longitudinally through the center of bridge timbers. This
continued till 1870, when the works were burned, and in rebuilding them
the boring machinery was not replaced. The longitudinal hole allowed a
portion of the sap to evaporate without checking the outside of the
timber, and undoubtedly lengthened its life. It is believed there are
yet (1885) some sticks of timber in the bridges of the road that were so
prepared in 1868 or 1869.

In 1867 Mr. W.H. Smith patented a method of preserving timber, by
incasing it in vitrified earthenware pipes, and filling the space
between the timber and the pipe with a grouting of hydraulic cement.
This was applied to the railroad bridge connecting the mainland with
Galveston Island (experiment No. 12), and so well did it seem to succeed
at first that it was proposed to extend the process to railroad
trestlework, to fencing, to supports for houses, and to telegraph poles.
But after a while the earthenware pipes were displaced and broken, the
process was given up, and Galveston bridge is now creosoted.

In 1868 Mr. S. Beer patented a process for preserving wood by simply
washing out the sap from its cells. Having ascertained that borax is a
solvent for sap, he prepared a number of specimens by boiling them in a
