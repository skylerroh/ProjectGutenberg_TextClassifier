the interview was over. He drank another ritual cup, made his farewells
and walked thoughtfully back to camp.

"Kung," Griffin asked over coffee next afternoon, "how well up are you
on Chinese mythology?"

"Oh, fair, I guess. It isn't my field but I remember some of the
stories my grandfather used to tell me."

"What is your legend of creation?" Griffin persisted.

"It's pretty well garbled but I remember something about the Son of
Heaven bringing the early settlers from a land of two moons on the back
of his fire-breathing dragon. The dragon got sick and died so they
couldn't ever get back to heaven again. There's a lot of stuff about
devils, too."

"What about devils?"

"I don't remember too well, but they were supposed to do terrible
things to you and even to your unborn children if they ever caught you.
They must have been pretty stupid though; they couldn't turn corners.
My grandfather's store had devil screens at all the doors so you had to
turn a corner to get in. The first time I saw the lead baffles at the
pile chamber doors on this ship it reminded me of home sweet home. By
the way, some young men from the village were around today. They want
to work passage to the next planet. What do you think?"

Griffin was silent for a long time.

"Well, what do you say? We can use some hand labor for the delicate
digging. Want to put them on?"

"Might as well." Griffin answered. "There's a streetcar every
millennium anyway."

"What do you mean by that?"

"You wouldn't understand. You sold your birthright to the barbarians."
