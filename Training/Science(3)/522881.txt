Go ahead, Bobby, hurt him, bite him again and make him bleed. And then
daddy caught Bobby by the neck and threw him across the room and slammed
the door shut and dragged something heavy up to block it. In a minute he
was running downstairs shouting Carol, _I heard it!_ you were right all
along--_I felt him, I felt what he was thinking!_ And mommy cried
please, Ben, take me away, let's leave them and never come back, never,
and daddy said it's horrible, he told that dog to kill me and it went
right for my throat, the boy is evil and monstrous. Even from downstairs
I could feel daddy's fear pounding into my head and then I heard the
door banging and looked out the window and saw daddy carrying suitcases
out through the snow to the car and then mommy came out running and the
car started down the hill and they were gone. Everything downstairs was
very quiet. I looked out the window and I couldn't see anything but the
big falling snowflakes and the sun going down over the hill.

Now Bobby and I and the panda are all together and I'm glad mommy and
daddy are gone. I went to sleep for a little while because my head hurt
so but now I'm awake and Bobby is lying across the room licking his feet
and I hope mommy and daddy never come back because Bobby will take care
of me. Bobby is my friend and he said he'd always take care of me no
matter what and he understands my think-talk even if he isn't very
smart.

It's beginning to get cold in the house now because nobody has gone down
to fix the fire but I don't care about that. Pretty soon I will tell
Bobby to push open the door and go down and fix the fire and then I will
tell him to get supper for me and then I will stay up all night because
mommy and daddy aren't here to make me go to bed. There's just me and
Bobby and the panda, and Bobby promised he'd take care of me because
he's my friend.

It's getting very cold now, and I'm getting hungry.
