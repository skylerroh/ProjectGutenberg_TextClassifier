Eddie Bowren took the book of micro-film from under his arm, the one
Gloria Munsel had given him. He put it on the table. "That has been
thoroughly checked by scientists, and their report is included. I
thought it surely was a false report, until they checked it. The first
page there gives a brief outline of what the micro-film contains."

The Chairman read, then looked up. He coughed. He mopped at his head.

Eddie said. "As I saw it up there, this is the way it's going to stay.
We'll never get into space, not without using the methods that were used
with me. And they're too destructive. I've been examined. I could never
go through it again and live. And that's the only way Earth men can ever
get into space. The women aren't coming back to us. They have husbands
of their own now. Believe me, those women aren't going to leave their
perfect husbands. They've set up a completely feminine culture. It's
theirs, all theirs. They'll never give it up to return to a masculine
world, and that's what Earth will always be to them. There are only a
few women left on Earth, and they're of such subnormal intelligence as
to be only a menace to any possible future progeny. Our birthrate has
stopped. We are living under extremely abnormal circumstances without
women. I have, as I said before, but one recommendation to this
Committee, and you take it for what it's worth. I personally don't
care--much--and that isn't important either."

"What is your recommendation, Bowren?"

"I assure you that the formulas in that book will work for us, Mr.
Chairman. Will you accept the reports of the scientists who investigated
those formulas?"

"I will," the Chairman said hoarsely. "I'll accept it. Why not--?"

Bowren grinned thinly at the ten men. "There's the secret of doing what
the women have done. It'll work for us too. Our only chance for survival
is to follow their procedure. We've got to start turning at least a
percentage of ourselves into women."

One man leaned forward and put his head on his arms. The others sat
there, in a kind of stunned numb attitude, their eyes drifting vaguely.

The Chairman coughed and looked around the silent hall, and at the other
ten men in it.

"Any volunteers?" he whispered.
