number of processes and is produced in very large quantities. It forms
large blue crystals, which lose water when heated and crumble to a white
powder. The salt finds many uses, especially in electrotyping and in
making electrical batteries.

~Cupric sulphide~ (CuS). The insoluble black sulphide (CuS) is easily
prepared by the action of hydrosulphuric acid upon a solution of a
copper salt:

    CuSO_{4} + H_{2}S = CuS + H_{2}SO_{4}.

It is insoluble in water and dilute acids.


MERCURY

~Occurrence.~ Mercury occurs in nature chiefly as the sulphide (HgS)
called cinnabar, and in globules of metal inclosed in the cinnabar. The
mercury mines of Spain have long been famous, California being the next
largest producer.

~Metallurgy.~ Mercury is a volatile metal which has but little affinity
for oxygen. Sulphur, on the other hand, readily combines with oxygen.
These facts make the metallurgy of mercury very simple. The crushed ore,
mixed with a small amount of carbon to reduce any oxide or sulphate that
might be formed, is roasted in a current of air. The sulphur burns to
sulphur dioxide, while the mercury is converted into vapor and is
condensed in a series of condensing vessels. The metal is purified by
distillation.

~Properties.~ Mercury is a heavy silvery liquid with a density of 13.596.
It boils at 357 deg. and solidifies at -39.5 deg.. Small quantities of many
metals dissolve in it, forming liquid alloys, while with larger
quantities it forms solid alloys. The alloys of mercury are called
amalgams.

Toward acids mercury conducts itself very much like copper; it is easily
attacked by nitric and hot, concentrated sulphuric acids, while cold
sulphuric and hydrochloric acids have no effect on it.

~Uses.~ Mercury is extensively used in the construction of scientific
instruments, such as the thermometer and barometer, and as a liquid over
which to collect gases which are soluble in water. The readiness with
which it alloys with silver and gold makes it very useful in the
extraction of these elements.

~Compounds of mercury.~ Like copper, mercury forms two series of
compounds: the mercurous, of which mercurous chloride (HgCl) is an
example; and the mercuric, represented by mercuric chloride (HgCl_{2}).

~Mercuric oxide~ (HgO). Mercuric oxide can be obtained either as a
brick-red or as a yellow substance. When mercuric nitrate is heated
carefully the red modification is formed in accordance with the equation

    Hg(NO_{3})_{2} = HgO + 2NO_{2} + O.

The yellow modification is prepared by adding a solution of a mercuric
salt to a solution of sodium or potassium hydroxide:

    Hg(NO_{3})_{2} + 2NaOH = 2NaNO_{3} + Hg(OH)_{2},

    Hg(OH)_{2} = HgO + H_{2}O.

When heated the oxide darkens until it becomes almost black; at a higher
temperature it decomposes into mercury and oxygen. It was by this
reaction that oxygen was discovered.

~Mercurous chloride~ (_calomel_) (HgCl). Being insoluble, mercurous
chloride is precipitated as a white solid when a soluble chloride is
added to a solution of mercurous nitrate:

    HgNO_{3} + NaCl = HgCl + NaNO_{3}.

Commercially it is manufactured by heating a mixture of mercuric
chloride and mercury. When exposed to the light it slowly changes into
mercuric chloride and mercury:

    2HgCl = HgCl_{2} + Hg.

It is therefore protected from the light by the use of colored bottles.
It is used in medicine.

Most mercurous salts are insoluble in water, the principal soluble one
being the nitrate, which is made by the action of cold, dilute nitric
acid on mercury.

~Mercuric chloride~ (_corrosive sublimate_) (HgCl_{2}). This substance can
be made by dissolving mercuric oxide in hydrochloric acid. On a
commercial scale it is made by subliming a mixture of common salt and
mercuric sulphate:

    2NaCl + HgSO_{4} = HgCl_{2} + Na_{2}SO_{4}.

The mercuric chloride, being readily volatile, vaporizes and is
condensed again in cool vessels. Like mercurous chloride it is a white
solid, but differs from it in that it is soluble in water. It is
extremely poisonous and in dilute solutions is used as an antiseptic in
dressing wounds.

~Mercuric sulphide~ (HgS). As cinnabar this substance forms the chief
native compound of mercury, occurring in red crystalline masses. By
passing hydrosulphuric acid into a solution of a mercuric salt it is
precipitated as a black powder, insoluble in water and acids. By other
means it can be prepared as a brilliant red powder known as vermilion,
which is used as a pigment in fine paints.

     ~The iodides of mercury.~ If a solution of potassium iodide is
     added to solutions of a mercurous and a mercuric salt
     respectively, the corresponding iodides are precipitated.
     Mercuric iodide is the more important of the two, and as
     prepared above is a red powder which changes to yellow on
     heating to 150 deg.. The yellow form on cooling changes back again
     to the red form, or may be made to do so by rubbing it with a
     knife blade or some other hard object.


SILVER

~Occurrence.~ Silver is found in small quantities in the uncombined state;
usually, however, it occurs in combination with sulphur, either as the
sulphide (Ag_{2}S) or as a small constituent of other sulphides,
especially those of lead and copper. It is also found alloyed with gold.

~Metallurgy.~ _Parkes's process._ Silver is usually smelted in connection
with lead. The ores are worked over together, as described under lead,
and the lead and silver obtained as an alloy, the silver being present
in small quantity. The alloy is melted and metallic zinc is stirred in.
Zinc will alloy with silver but not with lead, and it is found that the
silver leaves the lead and, in the form of an alloy with zinc, forms as
a crust upon the lead and is skimmed off. This crust, which, of course,
contains lead adhering to it, is partially melted and the most of the
lead drained off. The zinc is removed by distillation, and the residue
is melted on an open hearth in a current of air; by this means the zinc
and lead remaining with the silver are changed into oxides and the
silver remains behind unaltered.

     ~Amalgamation process.~ In some localities the old amalgamation
     process is used. The silver ore is treated with common salt and
     ferrous compounds, which process converts the silver first into
     chloride and then into metallic silver. Mercury is then added
     and thoroughly mixed with the mass, forming an amalgam with the
     silver. After some days the earthy materials are washed away
     and the heavier amalgam is recovered. The mercury is distilled
     off and the silver left in impure form.

~Refining silver.~ The silver obtained by either of the above processes
may still contain copper, gold, and iron, and is refined by "parting"
with sulphuric acid. The metal is heated with strong sulphuric acid
which dissolves the silver, copper, and iron present, but not the gold.
In the solution of silver sulphate so obtained copper plates are
suspended, upon which the pure silver precipitates, the copper going
into solution as sulphate, as shown in the equation

    Ag_{2}SO_{4} + Cu = 2Ag + CuSO_{4}.

The solution obtained as a by-product in this process furnishes most of
the blue vitriol of commerce. Silver is also refined by electrolytic
methods similar to those used in refining copper.

~Properties of silver.~ Silver is a heavy, rather soft, white metal, very
ductile and malleable and capable of taking a high polish. It surpasses
all other metals as a conductor of heat and electricity, but is too
costly to find extensive use for such purposes. It melts at a little
lower temperature than copper (961 deg.). It alloys readily with other heavy
metals, and when it is to be used for coinage a small amount of
copper--from 8 to 10%--is nearly always melted with it to give it
hardness.

It is not acted upon by water or air, but is quickly tarnished when in
contact with sulphur compounds, turning quite black in time.
Hydrochloric acid and fused alkalis do not act upon it, but nitric acid
and hot, concentrated sulphuric acid dissolve it with ease.

[Illustration: Fig. 88]

     ~Electroplating.~ Since silver is not acted upon by water or air,
     and has a pleasing appearance, it is used to coat various
     articles made of cheaper metals. Such articles are said to be
     silver plated. The process by which this is done is called
     electroplating. It is carried on as follows: The object to be
     plated (such as a spoon) is attached to a wire and dipped into
     a solution of a silver salt. Electrical connection is made in
     such a way that the article to be plated serves as the cathode,
     while the anode is made up of one or more plates of silver
     (Fig. 88, A). When a current is passed through the
     electrolyte silver dissolves from the anode plate and deposits
     on the cathode in the form of a closely adhering layer. By
     making the proper change in the electrolyte and anode plate
     objects may be plated with gold and other metals.

~Compounds of silver.~ Silver forms two oxides but only one series of
salts, namely, the one which corresponds to the mercurous and cuprous
series.

~Silver nitrate~ (_lunar caustic_) (AgNO_{3}). This salt is easily
prepared by dissolving silver in nitric acid and evaporating the
resulting solution. It crystallizes in flat plates, and when heated
carefully can be melted without decomposition. When cast into sticks it
is called lunar caustic, for it has a very corrosive action on flesh,
and is sometimes used in surgery to burn away abnormal growths.

     The alchemists designated the metals by the names of the
     heavenly bodies. The moon (luna) was the symbol for silver;
     hence the name "lunar caustic."

~Silver sulphide~ (Ag_{2}S). This occurs in nature and constitutes one of
the principal ores of silver. It can be obtained in the form of a black
solid by passing hydrosulphuric acid through a solution of silver
nitrate.

~Compounds of silver with the halogens.~ The chloride, bromide, and iodide
of silver are insoluble in water and acids, and are therefore
precipitated by bringing together a soluble halogen salt with silver
nitrate:

    AgNO_{3} + KCl = AgCl + KNO_{3}.

They are remarkable for the fact that they are very sensitive to the
action of light, undergoing a change of color and chemical composition
when exposed to sunlight, especially if in contact with organic matter
such as gelatin.

     ~Photography.~ The art of photography is based on the fact that
     the halogen compounds of silver are affected by the light,
     particularly in the presence of organic matter. From a chemical
     standpoint the processes involved may be described under two
     heads: (1) the preparation of the negative; (2) the preparation
     of the print.

     1. _Preparation of the negative._ The plate used in the
     preparation of the negative is made by spreading a thin layer
     of gelatin, in which silver bromide is suspended (silver iodide
     is sometimes added also), over a glass plate or celluloid film
     and allowing it to dry. When the plate so prepared is placed in
     a camera and the image of some object is focused upon it, the
     silver salt undergoes a change which is proportional at each
     point to the intensity of the light falling upon it. In this
     way an image of the object photographed is produced upon the
     plate, which is, however, invisible and is therefore called
     "latent." It can be made visible by the process of developing.

     To develop the image the exposed plate is immersed in a
     solution of some reducing agent called the developer. The
     developer reduces that portion of the silver salt which has
     been affected by the light, depositing it in the form of black
     metallic silver which closely adheres to the plate.

     The unaffected silver salt, upon which the developer has no
     action, must now be removed from the plate. This is done by
     immersing the plate in a solution of sodium thiosulphate
     (hypo). After the silver salt has been dissolved off, the plate
     is washed with water and dried. The plate so prepared is
     called the negative because it is a picture of the object
     photographed, with the lights exactly reversed. This is called
     fixing the negative.

     2. _Preparation of the print._ The print is made from paper
     which is prepared in the same way as the negative plate. The
     negative is placed upon this paper and exposed to the light in
     such a way that the light must pass through the negative before
     striking the paper. If the paper is coated with silver
     chloride, a visible image is produced, in which case a
     developer is not needed. The proofs are made in this way. In
     order to make them permanent the unchanged silver chloride must
     be dissolved off with sodium thiosulphate. The print is then
     toned by dipping it into a solution of gold or platinum salts.
     The silver on the print passes into solution, while the gold or
     platinum takes its place. These metals give a characteristic
     color or tone to the print, the gold making it reddish brown,
     while the platinum gives it a steel-gray tone. If a silver
     bromide paper is used in making the print, a latent image is
     produced which must be developed as in the case of the negative
     itself. The silver bromide is much more sensitive than the
     chloride, so that the printing can be done in artificial light.
     Since the darkest places on the negative cut off the most
     light, it is evident that the lights of the print will be the
     reverse of those of the negative, and will therefore correspond
     to those of the object photographed. The print is therefore
     called the positive.

====================================================================

~The family.~ Tin and lead, together with silicon and germanium, form a
family in Group IV of the periodic table. Silicon has been discussed
along with the non-metals, while germanium, on account of its rarity,
needs only to be mentioned.

The other family of Group IV includes carbon, already described, and a
number of rare elements.


TIN

~Occurrence.~ Tin is found in nature chiefly as the oxide (SnO_{2}),
called cassiterite or tinstone. The most famous mines are those of
Cornwall in England, and of the Malay Peninsula and East India Islands;
in small amounts tinstone is found in many other localities.

~Metallurgy.~ The metallurgy of tin is very simple. The ore, separated as
far as possible from earthy materials, is mixed with carbon and heated
in a furnace, the reduction taking place readily. The equation is

    SnO_{2} + C = Sn + CO_{2}.

The metal is often purified by carefully heating it until it is partly
melted; the pure tin melts first and can be drained away from the
impurities.

~Properties.~ Pure tin, called block tin, is a soft white metal with a
silver-like appearance and luster; it melts readily (235 deg.) and is
somewhat lighter than copper, having a density of 7.3. It is quite
malleable and can be rolled out into very thin sheets, forming tin foil;
most tin foil, however, contains a good deal of lead.

Under ordinary conditions it is quite unchanged by air or moisture, but
at a high temperature it burns in air, forming the oxide SnO_{2}. Dilute
acids have no effect upon it, but concentrated acids attack it readily.
Concentrated hydrochloric acid changes it into the chloride

    Sn + 2HCl = SnCl_{2} + 2H.

With sulphuric acid tin sulphate and sulphur dioxide are formed:

    Sn + 2H_{2}SO_{4} = SnSO_{4} + SO_{2} + 2H_{2}O

Concentrated nitric acid oxidizes it, forming a white insoluble compound
of the formula H_{2}SnO_{3}, called metastannic acid:

    3Sn + 4HNO_{3} + H_{2}O = 3H_{2}SnO_{3} + 4NO.

~Uses of tin.~ A great deal of tin is made into tin plate by dipping thin
steel sheets into the melted metal. Owing to the way in which tin
resists the action of air and dilute acids, tin plate is used in many
ways, such as in roofing, and in the manufacture of tin cans, cooking
vessels, and similar articles.

Many useful alloys contain tin, some of which have been mentioned in
connection with copper. When tin is alloyed with other metals of low
melting point, soft, easily melted alloys are formed which are used for
friction bearings in machinery; tin, antimony, lead, and bismuth are the
chief constituents of these alloys. Pewter and soft solder are alloys of
tin and lead.

~Compounds of tin.~ Tin forms two series of compounds: the stannous, in
which the tin is divalent, illustrated in the compounds SnO, SnS,
SnCl_{2}; the stannic, in which it is tetravalent as shown in the
compounds SnO_{2}, SnS_{2}. There is also an acid, H_{2}SnO_{3}, called
stannic acid, which forms a series of salts called stannates. While this
acid has the same composition as metastannic acid, the two are quite
different in their chemical properties. This difference is probably due
to the different arrangement of the atoms in the molecules of the two
substances. Only a few compounds of tin need be mentioned.

~Stannic oxide~ (SnO_{2}). Stannic oxide is of interest, since it is the
chief compound of tin found in nature. It is sometimes found in
good-sized crystals, but as prepared in the laboratory is a white
powder. When fused with potassium hydroxide it forms potassium stannate,
acting very much like silicon dioxide:

    SnO_{2} + 2KOH = K_{2}SnO_{3} + H_{2}O.

~Chlorides of tin.~ Stannous chloride is prepared by dissolving tin in
concentrated hydrochloric acid and evaporating the solution to
crystallization. The crystals which are obtained have the composition
SnCl_{2}.2H_{2}O, and are known as tin crystals. By treating a solution
of stannous chloride with aqua regia, stannic chloride is formed:

    SnCl_{2} + 2Cl = SnCl_{4}.

The salt which crystallizes from such a solution has the composition
SnCl_{4}.5H_{2}O, and is known commercially as oxymuriate of tin. If
metallic tin is heated in a current of dry chlorine, the anhydrous
chloride (SnCl_{4}) is obtained as a heavy colorless liquid which fumes
strongly on exposure to air.

The ease with which stannous chloride takes up chlorine to form stannic
chloride makes it a good reducing agent in many reactions, changing the
higher chlorides of metals to lower ones. Thus mercuric chloride is
changed into mercurous chloride:

    SnCl_{2} + 2HgCl_{2} = SnCl_{4} + 2HgCl.

If the stannous chloride is in excess, the reaction may go further,
producing metallic mercury:

    SnCl_{2} + 2HgCl = SnCl_{4} + 2Hg.

Ferric chloride is in like manner reduced to ferrous chloride:

    SnCl_{3} + 2FeCl_{3} = SnCl_{4} + 2FeCl_{2}.

The chlorides of tin, as well as the alkali stannates, are much used as
mordants in dyeing processes. The hydroxides of tin and free stannic
acid, which are easily liberated from these compounds, possess in very
marked degree the power of fixing dyes upon fibers, as explained under
aluminium.


LEAD

~Occurrence.~ Lead is found in nature chiefly as the sulphide (PbS),
called galena; to a much smaller extent it occurs as carbonate,
sulphate, chromate, and in a few other forms. Practically all the lead
of commerce is made from galena, two general methods of metallurgy being
in use.

~Metallurgy.~ 1. The sulphide is melted with scrap iron, when iron
sulphide and metallic lead are formed; the liquid lead, being the
heavier, sinks to the bottom of the vessel and can be drawn off:

    PbS + Fe = Pb + FeS.

2. The sulphide is roasted in the air until a part of it has been
changed into oxide and sulphate. The air is then shut off and the
heating continued, the reactions indicated in the following equations
taking place:

    2PbO + PbS = 3Pb + SO_{2},

    PbSO_{4} + PbS = 2Pb + 2SO_{2}.

The lead so prepared usually contains small amounts of silver, arsenic,
antimony, copper, and other metals. The silver is removed by Parkes's
method, as described under silver, and the other metals in various ways.
The lead of commerce is one of the purest commercial metals, containing
as a rule only a few tenths per cent of impurities.

~Properties.~ Lead is a heavy metal (den. = 11.33) which has a brilliant
silvery luster on a freshly cut surface, but which soon tarnishes to a
dull blue-gray color. It is soft, easily fused (melting at 327 deg.), and
quite malleable, but has little toughness or strength.

It is not acted upon to any great extent by the oxygen of the air under
ordinary conditions, but is changed into oxide at a high temperature.
With the exception of hydrochloric and sulphuric acids, most acids, even
very weak ones, act upon it, forming soluble lead salts. Hot,
concentrated hydrochloric and sulphuric acids also attack it to a slight
extent.

~Uses.~ Lead is employed in the manufacture of lead pipes and in large
storage batteries. In the form of sheet lead it is used in lining the
chambers of sulphuric acid works and in the preparation of paint
pigments. Some alloys of lead, such as solder and pewter (lead and tin),
shot (lead and arsenic), and soft bearing metals, are widely used. Type
metal consists of lead, antimony, and sometimes tin. Compounds of lead
form several important pigments.

~Compounds of lead.~ In nearly all its compounds lead has a valence of 2,
but a few corresponding to stannic compounds have a valence of 4.

~Lead oxides.~ Lead forms a number of oxides, the most important of which
are litharge, red lead or minium, and lead peroxide.

1. _Litharge_ (PbO). This oxide forms when lead is oxidized at a rather
low temperature, and is obtained as a by-product in silver refining. It
is a pale yellow powder, and has a number of commercial uses. It is
easily soluble in nitric acid:

    PbO + 2HNO_{3} = Pb(NO_{3})_{2} + H_{2}O.

2. _Red lead, or minium_ (Pb_{3}O_{4}). Minium is prepared by heating
lead (or litharge) to a high temperature in the air. It is a heavy
powder of a beautiful red color, and is much used as a pigment.

3. _Lead peroxide_ (PbO_{2}). This is left as a residue when minium is
heated with nitric acid:

Pb_{3}O_{4} + 4HNO_{3} = 2Pb(NO_{3})_{2} + PbO_{2} + 2H_{2}O.

It is a brown powder which easily gives up a part of its oxygen and,
like manganese dioxide and barium dioxide, is a good oxidizing agent.

~Soluble salts of lead.~ The soluble salts of lead can be made by dissolving
(Pb(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2}.3H_{2}O), litharge in acids. Lead acetate
called sugar of lead, and lead nitrate (Pb(NO_{3})_{2}) are the most
familiar examples. They are while crystalline solids and are poisonous
in character.

~Insoluble salts of lead; lead carbonate.~ While the normal carbonate of
lead (PbCO_{3}) is found to some extent, in nature and can be prepared
in the laboratory, basic carbonates of varying composition are much more
easy to obtain. One of the simplest of these has the composition
2PbCO_{3}.Pb(OH)_{2}. A mixture of such carbonates is called white lead.
This is prepared on a large scale as a paint pigment and as a body for
paints which are to be colored with other substances.

     ~White lead.~ White lead is an amorphous white substance which,
     when mixed with oil, has great covering power, that is, it
     spreads out in an even waxy film, free from streaks and lumps,
     and covers the entire surface upon which it is spread. Its
     disadvantage as a pigment lies in the fact that it gradually
     blackens when exposed to sulphur compounds, which are often
     present in the air, forming black lead sulphide (PbS).

     ~Technical preparation of white lead.~ Different methods are used
     in the preparation of white lead, but the old one known as the
     Dutch process is still the principal one employed. In this
     process, earthenware pots about ten inches high and of the
     shape shown in Fig. 89 are used. In the bottom A is placed a
     3% solution of acetic acid (vinegar answers the purpose very
     well). The space above this is filled with thin, perforated,
     circular pieces of lead, supported by the flange B of the
     pot. These pots are placed close together on a bed of tan bark
     on the floor of a room known as the corroding room. They are
     covered over with boards, upon which tan bark is placed, and
     another row of pots is placed on this. In this way the room is
     filled. The white lead is formed by the fumes of the acetic
     acid, together with the carbon dioxide set free in the
     fermentation of the tan bark acting on the lead. About three
     months are required to complete the process.
