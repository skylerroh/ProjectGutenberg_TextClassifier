THE BLAKE "LION AND EAGLE" CRUSHER,
A patented improvement of the former "New Pattern" Blake machine.
Has much greater efficiency than the old. It requires only about half
the power to drive, and is transported at much less expense (the size
most used weighing several thousand pounds less than the unimproved
machine). It requires less than half the time in oiling and other
manipulation, and less than half the expense for repairs. Address

STRUCTURAL IRON.

It is believed that, were owners fully aware of the small
difference in cost which now exists between iron and
wood, the former, in many cases, would be adopted,
thereby saving _insurance_ and avoiding all risk of _interruption_
to _business_ in consequence of fire. Book of detailed

beautiful and very expensive engravings. Three
hundred pages, more than 50 valuable prescriptions for
all forms of prevailing disease, the result of many years

CAVEATS, COPYRIGHTS, LABEL
REGISTRATION, ETC.

Messrs. Munn & Co., in connection with the publication
of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, continue to examine
Improvements, and to act as Solicitors of Patents for
Inventors.

In this line of business they have had OVER THIRTY
YEARS' EXPERIENCE, and now have _unequaled facilities_
for the Preparation of Patent Drawings, Specifications,
and the Prosecution of Applications for Patents in the
United States, Canada, and Foreign Countries. Messrs.
Munn & Co. also attend to the preparation of Caveats,
Registration of Labels, Copyrights for Books, Labels,
Reissues, Assignments, and Reports on Infringements
of Patents. All business intrusted to them is done
with special care and promptness, on very moderate
terms.

We send free of charge, on application, a pamphlet
containing further information about Patents and how
to procure them; directions concerning Labels, Copyrights,
Designs, Patents, Appeals, Reissues, Infringements,
Assignments, Rejected Cases, Hints on the Sale
of Patents, etc.

_Foreign Patents_.--We also send, _free of charge_, a
Synopsis of Foreign Patent Laws, showing the cost and
method of securing patents in all the principal countries
of the world. American inventors should bear in
mind that, as a general rule, any invention that is valuable
to the patentee in this country is worth equally as
much in England and some other foreign countries.
Five patents--embracing Canadian, English, German,
French, and Belgian--will secure to an inventor the exclusive
monopoly to his discovery among about ONE
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLIONS of the most intelligent
people in the world. The facilities of business and
steam communication are such that patents can be obtained
abroad by our citizens almost as easily as at
home. The expense to apply for an English patent is
$75; German, $100; French, $100; Belgian, $100; Canadian, $50.

_Copies of Patents_.--Persons desiring any patent
issued from 1836 to November 20, 1866, can be supplied
with official copies at reasonable cost, the price depending
upon the extent of drawings and length of
specifications.

Any patent issued since November 20, 1866, at which
time the Patent Office commenced printing the drawings
and specifications, may be had by remitting to
this office $1.

A copy of the claims of any patent issued since 1836
will be furnished for $1.

When ordering copies, please to remit for the same
