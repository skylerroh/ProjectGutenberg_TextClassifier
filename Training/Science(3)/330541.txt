[Illustration: Fig. 35. A representation of a deformed trunk.]

141. The loss of symmetry and diminution of height from deformed
spines are minor considerations, compared with the distortions that
the chest experiences, thereby impairing respiration and inducing
diseases of the heart and lungs. The invasion of the functions of
these two important organs lessens the vitality of the whole system,
and causes general ill health. Again, the curvature of the spinal
column is frequently attended by irritation and disease of the spinal
cord.

Why does the right shoulder project more frequently than the left? How
can this deformity be prevented? 141. What is said of deformed spinal
columns?

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

142. Eminent physicians, both in this country and France state that
not more than one female in ten, who has been fashionably educated, is
free from deformities of the shoulder or spinal column. Teachers, as
well as mothers, should notice the positions of the child in
performing the tasks allotted to it, whether studying or pursuing any
employment. The feebler the organization of the child, the more
frequently should there be a change of position.

143. When a slight projection of the shoulder, with a curvature of the
spine, exists, it can be improved by walking with a book, or something
heavier, upon the head; to balance which, the spinal column must be
nearly erect. Those people that carry burdens upon their heads seldom
have crooked spines.

_Observation._ Persons from the North, in travelling through the
Southern States, are surprised to see the heavy burdens that the
porters carry on their heads. It is not unusual to see them walking at
a rapid pace, with one or two trunks, weighing fifty or eighty pounds
each, upon their heads. Occasionally, we meet an itinerant toy-man,
with his tray of fragile merchandise upon his head, walking with as
much apparent security, as though his toys, or images, were in his
hands. This is the easiest method of carrying burdens, because the
position of the head and spinal column is erect.

144. _If the animal and earthy matter of the bones is not deposited in
proper proportions, they are deficient in strength._ If the gelatin
predominates, the bones are weak, and become distorted. When
nutrition is defective in the cylindrical bones, the heads are
generally enlarged, and the shafts crooked; if in the spinal column,
it may be curved; or in the cranium, it may be enlarged. This disease
is familiarly known by the name of rickets. It is most common among
these who have poor and insufficient food, live in dark, damp rooms,
and breathe a vitiated air. The prevention and remedies for this
disease are cleanliness, regular exercise, pure air, and nutritious
food.

the spine? What caution to teachers and mothers? 143. Why should we
stand and sit erect? How may slight deformities of the spine be
prevented? What is frequently noticed in travelling South? 144. What
is the effect upon the bones when the gelatin preponderates?

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

145. When a bone is broken, some days elapse before the substance that
reunites it is thrown out from the blood. In young persons, it may be
secreted during the second or third week, and in individuals advanced
in life, usually during the third and fourth week. When the bone is
uniting, during the second, third, or fourth week, the attention of a
surgeon is more needed than during the first week. At this time, the
ends of the bone should be placed together with accuracy, which
requires the careful application of proper dressing. After the bones
have united, it will take some weeks to consolidate the uniting
material and render the "callus," or union, firm. During this time,
the limb should be used with care.

_Observation._ When a bone is fractured, a surgeon is immediately
called, and the bone is "set." While the limb remains swelled and
painful, the surgeon is required to attend and keep the dressings
(bandages and splints) on. When the swelling has abated, and the pain
subsided, frequently the patient intimates to the surgeon that his
services can be dispensed with, as the "limb is doing well." This is
the most important period, as the bone is uniting, and, unless the
ends are nicely adjusted, the dressing properly applied, the person
will find, on recovery, a shortened and crooked limb. The surgeon is
then censured, when he is not blamable.

this disease? 145. Does the time vary when the reuniting substance of
the bone is secreted from the blood? When is the surgeon's care most
needed? Why?

146. It is seldom that a bone is displaced without injury to the
connecting ligaments and membranes. When these connecting bands are
lacerated, pain, swelling, and other symptoms indicating inflammation
succeed, which should be removed by proper treatment, directed by a
surgical adviser.

147. In sprains, but few, if any, of the fibres of the connecting
ligaments are lacerated; but they are unduly strained and twisted,
which occasions acute pain at the time of the injury. This is followed
by inflammation and weakness of the joints. The treatment of these
injuries is similar to that of a dislocated bone after its reduction.
The most important item in the treatment during the few first days, is
rest.

148. In persons of scrofulous constitutions, and those in whom the
system is enfeebled by disease, white swellings and other chronic
diseases of the joints frequently succeed sprains. Such persons cannot
be too assiduous in adopting a proper and early treatment of injured
joints.

CHAPTER VIII

THE MUSCLES.


149. All the great motions of the body are caused by the movement of
some of the bones which form the framework of the system; but these,
independently of themselves, have not the power of motion, and only
change their position through the action of other organs attached to
them, which, by contracting, draw the bones after them. In some of the
slight movements, as the winking of the eye, no bones are displaced.
These moving, contracting organs are the _Mus'cles_, (lean meat.)


ANATOMY OF THE MUSCLES.

150. The MUSCLES, by their size and number, constitute the great bulk
of the body, upon which they bestow form and symmetry. In the limbs,
they are situated around the bones, which they invest and defend,
while they form, to some of the joints, their principal protection. In
the trunk, they are spread out to enclose cavities, and constitute a
defensive wall, capable of yielding to internal pressure, and
reassuming its original state.

151. In structure, a muscle is composed of _fas-cic'u-li_ (bundles of
fibres) of variable size. These are enclosed in a cellular membranous
investment, or sheath. Every bundle composed of a number of small
fibres, and each fibre consists of a number of filaments, each of
which is enclosed in a delicate sheath. Toward the extremity of the
organ the muscular fibre ceases, and the cellular structure becomes
aggregated, and so modified as to constitute _ten'dons_, (cords,) by
which the muscle is tied to the surface of the bone. The union is so
firm, that, under extreme violence, the bone will sooner break than
permit the tendon to separate from its attachment. In some situations,
there is an expansion of the tendon, in the manner of a membrane,
called _Ap-o-neu-ro'sis_, or _Fas'ci-a_.

motor organs called? 150-160. _Give the anatomy of the muscles._ 150.

_Observation._ The pupil can examine a piece of boiled beef, or the
leg of a fowl, and see the structure of the fibres and tendons of a
muscle.

[Illustration: Fig. 36. 1, A representation of the direction and
arrangement of the fibres in a fusiform, or spindle-shaped muscle. 2, In
a radiated muscle. 3, In a penniform muscle. 4, In a bipenniform muscle.
_t_, _t_, The tendons of a muscle.]

152. Muscles present various modifications in the arrangement of their
fibres, as relates to their tendinous structure. Sometimes they are
completely longitudinal, and terminate, at each extremity, in a
tendon, the entire muscle being spindle-shaped. In other situations,
they are disposed like the rays of a fan, converging to a tendinous
point, and constituting a _ra'di-ate_ muscle. Again they are
_pen'ni-form_, converging, like the plumes of a pen, to one side of a
tendon, which runs the whole length of the muscle; or they are
_bi-pen'ni-form_, converging to both sides of the tendon.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

How are tendons or cords formed? What is the expansion of a tendon
called? How can the structure of muscles and their fibres be shown?
What does fig. 36 represent? 152. Give the different arrangements of
muscular fibres.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

153. In the description of a muscle, its attachments are expressed by
the terms "origin" and "insertion." The term _origin_ is generally
applied to the more fixed or central attachment, or to the point
toward which motion is directed; while _insertion_ is assigned to the
more movable point, or to that most distant from the centre. The
middle, fleshy portion is called the "belly," or "swell." The color of
a muscle is red in warm-blooded fish and animals; and each fibre is
supplied with arteries, veins, lymphatics, and both sensitive and
motor nervous filaments.

154. The FASCIA is of various extent and thickness, distributed
through the different regions of the body, for the purpose of
investing and protecting the softer and more delicate organs. An
instance is seen in the membrane which envelopes a leg of beef, and
which is observed on the edges of the slices when it is cut for
broiling. When freshly exposed, it is brilliant in appearance, tough,
and inelastic. In the limbs it forms distinct sheaths to all the
muscles.

155. This tendinous membrane assists the muscles in their action, by
keeping up a tonic pressure on their surface. It aids materially in
the circulation of the fluids, in opposition to the laws of gravity.
In the palm of the hand and sole of the foot, it is a powerful
protection to the structures that enter into the formation of these
parts. In all parts of the system, the separate muscles are not only
invested by fascia, but they are arranged in layers, one over
another. The sheath of each muscle is loosely connected with another,
by the cellular membrane.

swell? What is the color of muscles? With what is each muscular fibre
supplied? 154. What is said of fascia? What is its appearance when
freshly exposed? 155. What effect has it on the muscles? Give other
uses of the fascia.

156. The interstices between the different muscles are filled with
adipose matter, or fat. This is sometimes called the packing of the
system. To the presence of this tissue, youth are indebted for the
roundness and beauty of their limbs.

[Illustration: Fig. 37. A transverse section of the neck. The separate
muscles, as they are arranged in layers, with their investing fasciae, are
beautifully represented. As the system is symmetrical, figures are placed
only on one side. In the trunk the muscles are arranged in layers,

_Practical Explanation._ The muscle 1, 1, elevates the eyebrows. The
muscle 2 closes the eye. The muscle 6 elevates the upper lip. The muscles
7, 8, 9, elevate the angle of the mouth. The muscle 10 brings the teeth
together when eating. The muscle 11 depresses the upper lip. The muscle
13 closes the mouth. The muscle 15 depresses the angle of the mouth. The
muscle 16 draws down the lower lip. The muscles 18, 19, 20, 23, depress
the lower jaw and larynx and elevate the sternum. The muscle 21, when
both sides contract, draws the head forward, or elevates the sternum;
when only one contracts, the face is turned one side toward the opposite
shoulder. The muscles 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, aid in respiration.]

   [5] In the plates illustrating the muscular system, the names of such
       muscles are given as are referred to in the paragraph
       "Practical Explanation." These names need not be committed to
       memory. If a pupil wishes to acquire a knowledge of the general
       attachment of the muscles represented in the plates, he can do
       so by _comparing_ the muscular plate with that of the skeleton,
       (fig. 28.)

_Observation._ When we are sick, and cannot take food, the body is
sustained by absorption of the fat. The removal of it into the blood
causes the sunken cheek, hollow eye, and prominent appearance of the
bones after a severe illness.

158. The number of muscles in the human body is more than five
hundred; in general, they form about the skeleton two layers, and are
distinguished into superficial and deep-seated muscles. Some of the
muscles are voluntary in their motions, or act under the government of
the will, as those which move the fingers, limbs, and trunk; while
others are involuntary, or act under the impression of their proper
stimulants, without the control of the individual, as the heart.

_Observations._ 1st. The abdominal muscles are expiratory, and the
chief agents for expelling the residuum from the rectum, the bile from
the gall bladder, the contents of the stomach and bowels when
vomiting, and the mucus and irritating substances from the bronchial
tubes, trachea, and nasal passages by coughing and sneezing. To
produce these effects they all act together. Their violent and
continued action sometimes produces hernia, and, when spasmodic, may
occasion ruptures of the different organs.

2d. The contraction and relaxation of the abdominal muscles and
diaphragm stimulate the stomach, liver, and intestines to a healthy
action, and are subservient to the digestive powers. If the
contractility of their muscular fibres is destroyed or impaired, the
tone of the digestive apparatus will be diminished, as in indigestion
and costiveness. This is frequently attended by a displacement of
those organs, as they generally gravitate towards the lower portion of
the abdominal cavity, when the sustaining muscles lose their tone and
become relaxed.

_Practical Explanation._ The rectus muscle, 11, bends the thorax upon the
abdomen when the lower extremity of the muscle is the fixed point; but
when the upper extremity is the fixed point, the effect is to bring
forward and raise the pelvis and lower extremities. They likewise depress
the ribs in respiration. The transverse muscle, 6, 7, 8, lessens the
cavity of the abdomen, and presses the intestines; stomach, and liver
upward, against the diaphragm, in expiration.]

backward, The muscle 5 elevates the arm. The muscles 8, 9, extend the
thigh on the body. The muscle 1 draws the head back and elevates the
chin. The muscle 16 depresses the ribs in expiration. The muscle 22
elevates the ribs in inspiration.]

159. The diaphragm, or midriff, is the muscular division between the
thorax and the abdomen. It is penetrated by the oesophagus on its way
to the stomach, by the aorta conveying blood toward the lower
extremity, and by the ascending vena cava, or vein, on its way to the
heart.

concavity is directed toward the abdomen, and thus, this cavity is
very much enlarged at the expense of that of the chest, which is
diminished to an equal extent.

CHAPTER IX.

PHYSIOLOGY OF THE MUSCLES.


161. The muscles exercise great influence upon the system. It is by
their contraction that we are enabled to pursue different employments.
By their action the farmer cultivates his fields, the mechanic wields
his tools, the sportsman pursues his game, the orator gives utterance
to his thoughts, the lady sweeps the keys of the piano, and the young
are whirled in the mazy dance. As the muscles bear so intimate a
relation to the pleasures and employments of man, a knowledge of the
laws by which their action is governed, and the conditions upon which
their health depends, should be possessed by all.

162. The peculiar characteristic of muscular fibres is _contractility_,
or the power of shortening their substance on the application of
stimuli, and again relaxing when the stimulus is withdrawn. This is
illustrated in the most common movements of life. Call into action the
muscles that elevate the arm, by the influence of the _will_, or mind,
(the common stimulus of the muscles,) and the hand and arm are
raised; withdraw this influence by a simple effort of the will, and
the muscles, before rigid and tense, become relaxed and yielding.

163. The contractile effect of the muscles, in producing the varied
movements of the system, may be seen in the bending of the elbow.
The tendon of one extremity of the muscle is attached to the
shoulder-bone, which acts as a fixed point; the tendon of the
other extremity is attached to one of the bones of the fore-arm. When
the swell of the muscle contracts, or shortens, its two extremities
approach nearer each other, and by the approximation of the
terminal extremities of the muscle, the joint at the elbow bends.
On this principle, all the joints of the system are moved. This is
illustrated by fig. 45.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

161-172. _Give the physiology of the muscles._ 161. What are some of
the influences exerted by the muscles on the system? 162. What is
peculiar to muscular fibres? How is this illustrated? 163. Explain how
the movements of the system are effected by the contraction of the
muscles.

[Illustration: Fig. 45. A representation of the manner in which all of
the joints of the body are moved. 1, The bone of the arm above the elbow.
2, One of the bones below the elbow. 3, The muscle that bends the elbow.
This muscle is united, by a tendon, to the bone below the elbow, (4,) at
the other extremity, to the bone above the elbow, (5,) 6, The muscle that
extends the elbow. 7, Its attachment to the point of the elbow. 8, A
weight in the hand to be raised. The central part of the muscle 3
contracts, and its two ends are brought nearer together. The bones below
the elbow are brought to the lines shown by 9, 10, 11. The weight is
raised in the direction of the curved line. When the muscle 6 contracts,
the muscle 3 relaxes and the fore-arm is extended.]

_Experiments._ 1st. Clasp the arm midway between the shoulder and
elbow, with the thumb and fingers of the opposite hand. When the arm
is bent, the inside muscle will become hard and prominent, and its
tendon at the elbow rigid, while the muscle on the opposite side will
become flaccid. Extend the arm at the elbow, and the outside muscle
will swell and become firm, while the inside muscle and its tendon at
the elbow will be relaxed.

Explain fig. 45. Give experiment 1st.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

2d. Clasp the fore-arm about three inches below the elbow, then open
and shut the fingers rapidly, and the swelling and relaxation of the
muscles on the opposite sides of the arms, alternating with each
other, will be felt, corresponding with the movement of the fingers.
While the fingers are bending, the inside muscles swell, and the
outside ones become flaccid; and, while the fingers are extending, the
inside muscles relax, and the outside ones swell. The alternate
swelling and relaxation of antagonist muscles may be felt in the
different movements of the limbs.

164. Each fibre of the several muscles receives from the brain, through
the nervous filament appropriated to it, a certain influence, called
nervous fluid, or stimulus. It is this that induces contraction, while
the suspension of this stimulus causes relaxation of the fibres. By
this arrangement, the action of the muscular system, both as regards
duration and power, is, to a limited extent, under the control of the
mind. The more perfect the control, the better the education of the
muscular system; as is seen in the graceful, effective, and
well-educated movements of musicians, dancers, skaters, &c.

165. The length of time which a muscle may remain contracted, varies.
The duration of the contraction of the voluntary muscles, in some
measure, is in an inverse ratio to its force. If a muscle has
contracted with violence, as when great effort is made to raise a
heavy weight, relaxation will follow sooner than when the contraction
has been less powerful, as in raising light bodies.

166. The velocity of the muscular contraction depends on the will.
Many of the voluntary muscles in man contract with great rapidity, so
that he is enabled to utter distinctly fifteen hundred letters in a
minute; the pronunciation of each letter requiring both relaxation and
contraction of the same muscle, thus making three thousand actions in
one minute. But the contraction of the muscles of some of the inferior
animals surpasses in rapidity those of man. The race-horse, it is
said, has run a mile in a minute; and many birds of prey will probably
pass not less than a thousand miles daily.

Give experiment 2d. 164. With what is each muscular fibre supplied?
What effect has this stimulus on the muscles? 165. how long does a
voluntary muscle remain contracted? 166. On what is the velocity of
muscular contraction dependent? How many letters may be pronounced in
a minute?

167. The functions of the involuntary muscles are necessary the
digestion of food, the absorption and circulation of the nutritive
fluids. They could not be trusted with safety to the control of the
will, lest the passions or the indiscretions of the person should
continually avert those operations so necessary to health, and even to
life. The Divine Builder of this complicated machine has wisely
ordered that the muscles upon which these motions depend, shall act
under the impression of their proper stimulants, without the control
of the individual.

168. Again, there are certain operations which could not be safely
intrusted to the absolute government of the voluntary muscles, or
entirely removed from their control. Thus life can be supported only a
few minutes without breathing; but it would be impossible to perform
the daily vocations of life if we were compelled to breathe at all
times, or at perfectly regular intervals.

169. It has been observed that, among men of the same size, a wide
difference exists in their strength and activity--qualities which
depend upon the size and number of the nerves, the size and activity
of the brain, and the education, or training of the muscles. Men
having large nerves leading to the muscles, with the brain active,
and muscles well trained will perform feats of strength and agility,
that other men, of the same size, cannot effect. Rope-dancers,
harlequins, and other performers of feats, are persons thus
constituted.

How many contractions and relaxations of the same muscle? What is said
of the rapidity of muscular contractions in other animals? 167. When
are the involuntary muscles called into action? Why would it not have
been safe to trust these important operations to the exclusive control
of the will? 168. Give an instance where some of the muscles act under
the government of the will, conjoined with those that are involuntary.
169. On what does the difference in muscular activity and strength
depend?

170. Persons with small muscles, and largely developed nervous
systems, will sometimes exhibit very great muscular power for a time;
but it will not be of long continuance, unless the brain is
functionally diseased, as in hysteria, delirium of fever, insanity,
