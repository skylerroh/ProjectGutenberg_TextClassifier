Hence it was surrounded by an advance force of bowmen and spearmen, and
before those soldiers set out Phagon voiced the orders he was to repeat
so often during the following hectic days.

"NO BURNING AND NO WANTON KILLING! None must know we come, but
nonetheless Sarlon is to be a province of Lomarr my kingdom and _I will
not have its people or its substance destroyed_! To that end I swear
by my royal head, by the Throne, by Great Llosir's heart and brain and
liver, that any man of whatever rank who slays or burns without my
express permission will be flayed alive and then boiled in oil!"

Hence the taking of Moyla's Landing was very quiet, and its people
were held under close guard. All that day and all the following night
the army rested. Phagon was pretty sure that Taggad knew nothing of
the invasion as yet; but it would be idle to hope to get much closer
without being discovered. Every mile gained, however, would be worth
a century of men. Therefore, long before dawn, the supremely ready
Lomarrian forces rolled over the screening bluff and marched steadily
toward Sarlo. Not fast, note; thirteen miles is a long haul when there
is to be a full-scale battle at the end of it.

Plodding slowly along on mighty Dreegor at the king's right, Tedric
roused himself from a brown study and, gathering his forces visibly,
spoke: "Knowst I love the Lady Rhoann, sire?"

"Aye. No secret that, nor has been since the fall of Sarpedion."

"Hast permission, then, to ask her to be my wife, once back in Lompoar?"

"Mayst ask her sooner than that, if you like. Wilt be here
tomorrow--with the Family, the Court, and an image of Great Llosir--for
the Triumph."

Tedric's mouth dropped open. "But sire," he managed finally, "how
couldst be _that_ sure of success? The armies are too evenly matched."

"In seeming only. They have no body of horse or foot able to stand
against my Royal Guard; they have nothing to cope with you and Sciro
and your armor and weapons. Therefore I have been and am certain of
Lomarr's success. Well-planned and well-executed ventures do not fail.
This has been long in the planning, but only your discovery of the
god-metal made it possible of execution." Then, as Tedric glanced
involuntarily at his gold-plated armor: "Yea, the overlay made it
possible for me to live--although I may die this day, being the center
of attack and being weaker and of lesser endurance that I thought--but
my life matters not beside the good of Lomarr. A king's life is of
import only to himself, to his Family, and to a few--wouldst be
surprised to learn how _very_ few--real friends."

"Your life matters to me, sire--and to Sciro!"

"Aye, Tedric my almost-son, that I know. Art in the forefront of those
few I spoke of. And take this not _too_ seriously, for I expect fully
to live. But in case I die, remember this: kings come and kings go; but
as long as it holds the loyalty of such as you and Sciro and your kind,
the Throne of Lomarr endures!"

       *       *       *       *       *

Taggad of Sarlon was not taken completely by surprise. However, he had
little enough warning, and so violent and hasty was his mobilization
that the Sarlonians were little if any fresher than the Lomarrians when
they met, a couple of miles outside the city's limit.

There is no need to describe in detail the arrangement of the centuries
and the legions, nor to dwell at length upon the bloodiness and
savagery of the conflict as a whole nor to pick out individual deeds of
derring-do, of heroism, or of cowardice. Of prime interest here is the
climactic charge of Lomarr's heavy horse--the Royal Guard--that ended
it.

There was little enough of finesse in that terrific charge, led
by glittering Phagon and his two alloy-clad lords. The best their
Middlemarch horses could do in the way of speed was a lumbering
canter, but their tremendous masses--a Middlemarch warhorse was not
considered worth saving unless he weighed at least one long ton--added
to the weight of man and armor each bore, gave them momentum starkly
irresistible. Into and through the ranks of Sarlonian armor the knights
of Lomarr's Old Blood crashed; each rising in his stirrups and swinging
down with all his might, with sword or axe or hammer, upon whatever
luckless wight was nearest at hand.

Then, re-forming, a backward smash; then another drive forward. But
men were being unhorsed; horses were being hamstrung or killed; of
a sudden king Phagon himself went down. Unhorsed, but not out--his
god-metal axe, scarcely stoppable by iron, was taking heavy toll.

As at signal, every mounted Guardsman left his saddle as one; and every
Guardsman who could move drove toward the flashing golden figure of his
king.

"Where now, sire?" Tedric yelled, above the clang of iron.

"Taggad's pavilion, of course--where else?" Phagon yelled back.

"Guardsmen, to me!" Tedric roared. "Make wedge, as you did at
Sarpedion's Temple!" and the knights who could not hear him were made
by signs to understand what was required. "To that purple tent we ram
Phagon our King. Elbows in, sire. Short thrusts only, and never mind
your legs. Now, men--_DRIVE!_"

With three giants in impregnable armor at point--Tedric and Sciro were
so close beside and behind the king as almost to be one with him--that
flying wedge simply could not be stopped. In little over a minute it
reached the pavilion and its terribly surprised owner. Golden tigers
seemed to leap and creep as the lustrous silk of the tent rippled
in the breeze; magnificent golden tigers adorned the Sarlonian's
purple-enameled armor.

"Yield, Taggad of Sarlon, or die!" Phagon shouted.

"If I yield, Oh Phagon of Lomarr, what...." Taggad began a conciliatory
speech, but even while speaking he whirled a long and heavy sword
out from behind him, leaped, and struck--so fast that neither Phagon
nor either of his lords had time to move; so viciously hard that
had Lomarr's monarch been wearing anything but super-steel he would
have joined his fathers then and there. As it was, however, the
fierce-driven heavy blade twisted, bent double, and broke.

Phagon's counter-stroke was automatic. His axe, swung with all his
strength and speed, crashed to the helve through iron and bone and
brain; and, as soon as the heralds with their clarions could spread the
news that Phagon had killed Taggad in hand to hand combat, all fighting
ceased.

"Captain Sciro, kneel!" With the flat of his sword Phagon struck the
steel-clad back a ringing blow. "Rise, Lord Sciro of Sarlon!"

_"So be it," Skandos One murmured gently, and took up the life and the
work of Skandos Four._

_Ultimate catastrophe was five hundred twenty-nine years away._
