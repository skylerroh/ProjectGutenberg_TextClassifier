PREPARED

ASPHALTE ROOFING FELT.

[Illustration]

This new prepared production is ready coated, and can be applied on
the roof without further trouble. It is easy of application, and does
not require any repairs for a long time. It is more durable than
some slates, and has been found a suitable substitute for iron or
tin roofs. It has a sanded or stony surface, which renders it
UNINFLAMMABLE and FIRE-PROOF. Exposed to the most intense fire, and
sparks falling upon it, it will not propagate the fire. Under the
influence of the sun it will not run, which makes it specially adapted
to hot climates. Its easy application and pleasing appearance have
made it a favorite roofing material throughout all the Indies and
other colonies. Being not cumbrous for transport, it is of invaluable
service to settlers and farmers in far remote districts. When used for
temporary purposes it may be taken off and applied again to another
construction. It replaces common Asphalting on Terraces, Lobbies,
Counting-houses, Office Floors, etc.; is a great preservative against
dampness and vermin, and equalizes the temperature. It is 32 inches
wide, and made in rolls of 25 yards each. Send for circular to
