                       _by
                 Alexander Blade_


       By accident Bobby discovered the rocket was
 about to be shot to the Moon. Naturally he wanted
 to go along. But could he smuggle himself aboard?

Dad had already gone when Bobby got up. This disappointed Bobby a little
but then he remembered--_this was the big day_. Naturally Dad would get
over to the project early. And at four o'clock-- Bobby shivered
deliciously at the thought of it.

He ate his breakfast in silence with Mom across the table drinking a cup
of coffee and looking at a fashion catalogue. He was glad she was
occupied because he didn't want to talk; not today he didn't. Might
spill something secret. Might even let out the _big secret_. That would
be terrible.

Of course, all things were secret at Buffalo Flats. So secret top
scientists like Dad didn't even discuss them with wives like Mom. And
wives like Mom never asked.
