little crystal about the size of an egg, fluorescing to beat Tophet. The
light from it stung my hands and face, almost like a static discharge,
and then I noticed another funny thing. Remember that wart I had on my
left thumb? Look!" Jarvis extended his hand. "It dried up and fell
off--just like that! And my abused nose--say, the pain went out of it
like magic! The thing had the property of hard x-rays or gamma
radiations, only more so; it destroyed diseased tissue and left healthy
tissue unharmed!

"I was thinking what a present _that'd_ be to take back to Mother Earth
when a lot of racket interrupted. We dashed back to the other side of
the wheel in time to see one of the pushcarts ground up. Some suicide
had been careless, it seems.

"Then suddenly the creatures were booming and drumming all around us and
their noise was decidedly menacing. A crowd of them advanced toward us;
we backed out of what I thought was the passage we'd entered by, and
they came rumbling after us, some pushing carts and some not. Crazy
brutes! There was a whole chorus of 'We are v-r-r-riends! Ouch!' I
didn't like the 'ouch'; it was rather suggestive.

"Tweel had his glass gun out and I dumped my water tank for greater
freedom and got mine. We backed up the corridor with the barrel-beasts
following--about twenty of them. Queer thing--the ones coming in with
loaded carts moved past us inches away without a sign.

"Tweel must have noticed that. Suddenly, he snatched out that glowing
coal cigar-lighter of his and touched a cart-load of plant limbs. Puff!
The whole load was burning--and the crazy beast pushing it went right
along without a change of pace! It created some disturbance among our
'V-r-r-riends,' however--and then I noticed the smoke eddying and
swirling past us, and sure enough, there was the entrance!

"I grabbed Tweel and out we dashed and after us our twenty pursuers. The
daylight felt like Heaven, though I saw at first glance that the sun was
all but set, and that was bad, since I couldn't live outside my
thermo-skin bag in a Martian night--at least, without a fire.

"And things got worse in a hurry. They cornered us in an angle between
two mounds, and there we stood. I hadn't fired nor had Tweel; there
wasn't any use in irritating the brutes. They stopped a little distance
away and began their booming about friendship and ouches.

"Then things got still worse! A barrel-brute came out with a pushcart
and they all grabbed into it and came out with handfuls of foot-long
copper darts--sharp-looking ones--and all of a sudden one sailed past my
ear--zing! And it was shoot or die then.

"We were doing pretty well for a while. We picked off the ones next to
the pushcart and managed to keep the darts at a minimum, but suddenly
there was a thunderous booming of 'v-r-r-riends' and 'ouches,' and a
whole army of 'em came out of their hole.

"Man! We were through and I knew it! Then I realized that Tweel wasn't.
He could have leaped the mound behind us as easily as not. He was
staying for me!

"Say, I could have cried if there'd been time! I'd liked Tweel from the
first, but whether I'd have had gratitude to do what he was
doing--suppose I _had_ saved him from the first dream-beast--he'd done
as much for me, hadn't he? I grabbed his arm, and said 'Tweel,' and
pointed up, and he understood. He said, 'No--no--no, Tick!' and popped
away with his glass pistol.

"What could I do? I'd be a goner anyway when the sun set, but I couldn't
explain that to him. I said, 'Thanks, Tweel. You're a man!' and felt
that I wasn't paying him any compliment at all. A man! There are mighty
few men who'd do that.

"So I went 'bang' with my gun and Tweel went 'puff' with his, and the
barrels were throwing darts and getting ready to rush us, and booming
about being friends. I had given up hope. Then suddenly an angel dropped
right down from Heaven in the shape of Putz, with his under-jets
blasting the barrels into very small pieces!

"Wow! I let out a yell and dashed for the rocket; Putz opened the door
and in I went, laughing and crying and shouting! It was a moment or so
before I remembered Tweel; I looked around in time to see him rising in
one of his nosedives over the mound and away.

"I had a devil of a job arguing Putz into following! By the time we got
the rocket aloft, darkness was down; you know how it comes here--like
turning off a light. We sailed out over the desert and put down once or
twice. I yelled 'Tweel!' and yelled it a hundred times, I guess. We
couldn't find him; he could travel like the wind and all I got--or else
I imagined it--was a faint trilling and twittering drifting out of the
south. He'd gone, and damn it! I wish--I wish he hadn't!"

The four men of the _Ares_ were silent--even the sardonic Harrison. At
last little Leroy broke the stillness.

"I should like to see," he murmured.

"Yeah," said Harrison. "And the wart-cure. Too bad you missed that; it
might be the cancer cure they've been hunting for a century and a half."

"Oh, that!" muttered Jarvis gloomily. "That's what started the fight!"
He drew a glistening object from his pocket.

"Here it is."
