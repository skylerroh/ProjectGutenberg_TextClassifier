_SEE?_

By EDWARD G. ROBLES, JR.


 _Seeing things? Don't go to an analyst--see
 the Commission--if it doesn't find you first!_


Well, there was this song a few years back. You know the one. Phil
Harris singing about a thing that you couldn't get rid of, no matter
what you did, a thing so repulsive it made you a social outcast. Never
thought I'd see one, though. Dirty Pete found it.

Don't rush me. I'll tell you about it.

We're hobos, understand? Now a hobo is a different breed of cat than
you think. Oh, people are getting educated to the idea that a hobo will
work and move on, whereas a tramp will mooch and move on, and a bum will
mooch and hang around, but you still find folks who are ignorant enough
to call us bums.
