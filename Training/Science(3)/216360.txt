Since the completion of the Etruria, for various reasons there has
been a pause in the tremendous strides made since 1879, and we may
briefly review the results. Taking the Britannic as a standard with
her ten years' average of 81/4 days across, and her quickest passage of
7 days 10 hours 53 seconds, we have now the following steamers of
higher speeds. Taking them in the order of their absolutely fastest
passage out or home, they stand thus:


TABLE I.

  ---+-------------------------+------+-------+------
     |                         | Days.| Hours.| Mins.
     |                         +------+-------+------
   1 | Etruria.                |   6  |   5   |  31
   2 | Umbria (sister ship).   |   slightly longer.
   3 | Oregon.                 |   6  |  10   |  35
   4 | America.                |   6  |  13   |  44
   5 | City of Rome.           |   6  |  18   |   0
   6 | Alaska.                 |   6  |  18   |  37
   7 | Servia.                 |   6  |  23   |  55
   8 | Aurania.                |   7  |   1   |   1
  ---+-------------------------+------+-------+------

It will thus be seen that from the 15 days' passage or thereabout, of
the earliest Atlantic steamers, we had got down in the days of the
Scotia to about 9 days; in the Britannic to 81/4 days, and, at the
present time, we have got to 61/4 days, with seven ships afloat that
have done the passage under seven days, and capable of making their
average passages range between 61/2 and 71/4 days.

Ranged in order of gross tonnage, these eight vessels stand as
follows:


TABLE II.

  1. City of Rome.    8,144
  2. Oregon.          7,375
  3. Aurania.         7,269
  4. Servia.          7,212
  5. Umbria.          7,129
  6. Etruria.         7,100
  7. Alaska.          6,586
  8. America.         5,528

Here the America shows to advantage, for while being eighth in size
she is fourth in point of speed, and from what the author can learn,
although he had no authenticated details on the subject, he believed
she is economical in coal consumption. He might perhaps be permitted
to say that one of the most difficult subjects in connection with the
propulsion of ships on which to get absolutely accurate data is that
of coal consumption. The records of six to eight hours' trials for the
purpose of ascertaining the coal consumption are absolutely worthless,
as all shipbuilders and engineers know, and so far as English ships
are concerned they are never attempted. Foreign owners frequently
stipulate for such trials in their contracts with English
shipbuilders, and get wonderfully economical results on paper, but the
fact that the trials only extend over a few hours renders them
valueless, however carefully the coal may be weighed during that
period. An authentic record of the absolute quantity of coal consumed,
say by each of the eight fastest Atlantic liners, together with their
average indicated horse power on the voyage, for a series of voyages,
would be extremely valuable.

He gave, in Table III., the consumption per indicated horse power per
hour for a number of ships. This table affords valuable data, for it
gives, in addition to the dimensions, the moulded draught of water,
the midship area, the displacement, the indicated horse power, the
speed on trial, the coefficients for the lines both from the block or
parallelopipedon, and also from the midship section prism, together
with the length and angle of entrance obtained by Kirk's rule, the
Admiralty displacement coefficient, together with the coal consumption
per day and per indicated horse power per hour.

[Illustration: Fig. 3--OREGON.]

This table, as will be seen, contains some of the most important of
the Atlantic liners, and also a number of other typical ships, which
will add a variety to its interest and a value to it. The coefficient,
which is contained in the thirteenth column of the table, viz.:

        Dis 2/3 x speed cubed
    -------------------------
    I.H.P. x sqrt(entrance.)
             ---------------
                     10

generally comes out for ships of similar type more nearly a constant
in the true sense of the word than the corresponding Admiralty
constant. As an example, we have the curves of resistance and horse
power for the City of Rome and the Normandie, a large vessel of 6,000
tons, which the Barrow Company built for the Compagnie Generale
Transatlantique, in which the coefficient of fineness and the form of
the lines pretty closely resemble each other below water; and if we
take from the curves the corresponding speeds and horse powers, and
work out the constants by the two systems, we have at 14 knots the
Admiralty constant for the City of Rome 322.2, and for the Normandie
304.8; and taking for a modified form of constant, the City of Rome
gives 253.7 and the Normandie 251.9, which, as will be seen, are much
closer together. Similarly, at 15 knots the Admiralty constant for the
City of Rome is 310, and for the Normandie 295.2, while a modified
constant comes out for the former at 245, and for the latter 244,
again agreeing almost identically. The same at 16 knots, for the City
of Rome the Admiralty constant comes out 297.6, and for the Normandie
282.8, while a modified constant comes out for the two ships 234.4 and
233.7 respectively, again showing marked agreement. It may be
mentioned that in these two ships the engines are of a similar type,
being three-crank tandem engines, and the propellers have in both
pitch and surface practically the same proportions to the power and
speed. The value of these modified constants will probably be found to
increase as the speeds increase up to the limit and beyond that point
at which wave resistance becomes an important factor.

  ¹Mean speed of a voyage across the Atlantic Ocean.

The author next considered the strains to which a ship is exposed, and
stated that he had before him the calculations for three of the
largest vessels, two of them of iron and the other of steel; and he
found, in the case of the iron, the maximum tension on the gunwale
during the greatest hogging strains likely to be endured at sea would
not exceed about six tons per square inch, while in the case of the
steel ship it is only about 61/2 tons. These strains are well within the
limits of safety, and a comparison of the scantlings of these with the
others justifies the assertion as to their general safety from a
structural point of view. The sections of these three ships are shown
in Figs. 1, 2, and 3, with their principal scantlings. It will be seen
from these sections that the three ships differ materially in their
mode of construction. In the case of Fig. 1, which represents the City
of Rome, the largest of the three, it will be seen that the main
framing of the vessel is entirely transverse, with very heavy keelsons
in the bottom, and large partial bulkheads or web frames, and the
outside plating arranged on what is termed the edge to edge principle,
with a great portion of it double. In the next section, Fig. 2, the
Servia, which is built of steel, on the other hand, the bottom is
built on the longitudinal cellular system, the first application, he
believed, of this system to an Atlantic liner. The plating of the
Servia is of the usual alternate outer and inner strake system, partly
double; while the third section, the Oregon, approaches more nearly to
the ordinary system of framing and plating usually adopted, but it
will be seen that she was well tied in the bottom by very heavy
intercostal and plate keelsons, as well as in the top by heavy
stringers and sheer strakes, with much of her plating doubled, and
heavy web frames inside. The author next considered the question of
stability, and went on to deal with the subject of twin screws, and
stated that the Barrow Shipbuilding Company has done more in the way
of planning and designing for the adoption of twin screws lately than
for any other mode of propulsion, and this chiefly for passenger
steamers. He did not attach much importance to the particular form of
the blade either in single or twin screws, as he believed so long as
the disk area, the surface, and pitch were properly adjusted to the
speed of the vessel, and to enable the engines to use, at the maximum
speed, just the full quantity of steam that the boilers can make, we
have got pretty nearly as far as we can get. To fix these dimensions
of the propeller accurately at the present time, and without further
knowledge of the action of the screw on the water, was, he thought,
impossible. All the rules and formulae are empirical. The best one he
knew is given in Table IV., due to Mr. Thom, the head of the Barrow
Company's engineering drawing office, and at present acting manager,
who has used it for some years in practice. These formulae are based
upon the assumption that the area of propeller disk should be
proportional to the indicated horse power, divided by the cube of the
speed, and the same with the projected area of the propeller and also
the surface.

The discussion which followed was opened by Mr. Holt. He said that if
they were to have greater speed on the Atlantic, there was one point
which was not alluded to in the paper, and that was the total
abolition of cargo on board the great passenger steamers. If vessels
were built solely for passenger traffic, they would be able to insure
greater speed by reason of the greater slightness in build and the
additional space at the command of the designer. The existing Atlantic
express steamer was far too heavy, and might, if cargo was dispensed
with, be made with finer lines and more yacht-like. He looked on the
proposition to fit such vessels with longitudinal bulkheads with great
fear. If a collision took place--such, for example, as that which sunk
the Oregon--water would get access to one side only of the ship, and
it was not at all improbable that if a sea was on, she would turn
right over. At all events, very serious risk would be involved.

Mr. W.H. White, Chief Constructor to the Admiralty, said the question
of twin screw propulsion was one of special interest to himself, and
had been so for many years. In 1878 he dealt with it as fully as he
then could on the basis of the Admiralty data, and he then ventured to
say everything in favor of twin screws that Mr. John had said in his
paper. If greater power than that now used in such a ship as the
Etruria, for example, were demanded, two screws must be used. Good as
are the results obtained with the Etruria, it was by no means certain
that still better might not be had. If she had been fitted with two
screws instead of one, very great advantage would be gained by the
greater submergence of the twin screws, as thus racing would be almost
wholly prevented.

Mr. Calvert urged that more attention should be devoted to studying
the relative values of different portions of the propeller.

The sitting was then suspended. In the afternoon, as we have already
stated, the members visited the steamship Germanic on the invitation
of Messrs. Ismay, Imrie & Co., subsequently proceeding to Messrs. Cope
Brothers' tobacco works, and thence to the exhibition, where the
dinner of the Institution took place in the evening.

On Friday morning no paper was read; some official business was
transacted, and this being done, the discussion on Mr. John's paper
was resumed.

Mr. Biles remarked that there were many advantages in the use of twin
screws which had not been sufficiently taken into account. When a ship
with twin screws was being handled in dock there was greater
maneuvering power, and therefore less liability for the ship to come
in contact with the walls, although, if she did so, there would be
greater probability of damage to the propellers. He thought means
could be easily devised of protecting the screws when the ship was in
dock. Another of the incidental advantages connected with twin screws
was that smaller engines and smaller propellers were required, and
therefore they might run them at a higher speed. They would also get
lighter machinery with twin screws, and there would be less liability
to have bad castings and forgings in the smaller engines, and of
course the cost would be less.

With respect to the question of the middle line bulkheads, he could
not quite agree with Mr. John as to the great advantages of them in a
big passenger steamer. He thought there would be greater difficulty in
managing a ship so built if she was in danger of sinking. Increased
subdivision in a longitudinal direction was a very desirable thing,
and almost necessary for a condition of immunity from sinking. In
future Atlantic steamers longitudinal bulkheads should be placed not
in the middle line, but nearer the sides of the ships, and they should
recognize the fact that they had engines and boilers in different
compartments, and make arrangements whereby the ship would still
float, although the doors in these compartments were kept open. The
