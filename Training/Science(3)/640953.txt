that had fascinated her, for some reason. Then, she said, he'd brought a
ten-year-old girl along--though where in the world old Vanderkamp could
have picked up a tot like that is beyond me--and the kid had added her
blandishments to the plot. Between them, they had managed to lure her
into the old guy's machine. From what she said, it was obviously the
time machine she was talking about, and if she was Julie there was no
reason why she shouldn't know about it. But she talked as though it was
a complete mystery to her, as though she'd no idea what the purpose of
it was. Well, anyway, here she was--and very unhappy, too. Wanted to go
back to old New Amsterdam, but bad.

"It was a beautiful act, even if she was nuts. The strange thing was,
though, that there were some things even a gal going whacky couldn't
explain. For instance, the house was filled with what the experts said
were priceless antiques from Dutch New Amsterdam, of the period just
prior to the British siege. You'd think those things would make poor
Julie feel more at home, seeing as she claimed to belong in that period,
but apparently they just made her homesick. And, curiously enough, all
the modern gadgets were gone. All those handy little items that make the
twentieth century so livable had been taken away--including the
washing-machine and dryer, by the way. Julie--or Anna, as she called
herself--claimed that Vanderkamp had taken it back with him, wherever
he'd gone to, after he'd brought her there."

"Poor woman," I said sympathetically. "They toted her off to the booby
hatch, I suppose."

"No...." Harrigan said slowly. "They didn't, as a matter of fact. Since
she was harmless, they let her stay in the house a while. Which was a
mistake, it seems. Of course, she _wasn't_ from the seventeenth century.
That's impossible. All the same--." He broke off abruptly and stared
moodily into his glass.

"What happened to her?" I asked.

"She was found one morning about two weeks after she got there," he
said. "Dead. Electrocuted. It seems she'd stuck her finger into a light
socket while standing in a bathtub full of water. An accident,
obviously. As the Medical Examiner said, it was an accident any
six-year-old child would have known enough about electricity to avoid.

"That is," Harrigan added, "a _twentieth-century_ child...."
