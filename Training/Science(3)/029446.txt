                                                    BY ROBERT SHECKLEY


    _When people talk about getting away from it all, they are usually
    thinking about our great open spaces out west. But to science
    fiction writers, that would be practically in the heart of Times
    Square. When a man of the future wants solitude he picks a slab of
    rock floating in space four light years east of Andromeda. Here is a
    gentle little story about a man who sought the solitude of such a
    location. And who did he take along for company? None other than
    Charles the Robot._


Mark Rogers was a prospector, and he went to the asteroid belt looking
for radioactives and rare metals. He searched for years, never finding
much, hopping from fragment to fragment. After a time he settled on a
slab of rock half a mile thick.

Rogers had been born old, and he didn't age much past a point. His face
was white with the pallor of space, and his hands shook a little. He
called his slab of rock Martha, after no girl he had ever known.
