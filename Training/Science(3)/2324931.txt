they are by far the least exhaustive of all cultivated plants; and we
thus recognise the justice of that practical rule, which lays it down as
an essential point of good husbandry that the straw ought, as far as
possible, to be consumed on the farm on which it is produced. As regards
the general constituents of the ash, it is also to be remarked that
though differences in their proportions exist, they are by no means so
marked as might be expected; thus there are no plants for which a large
quantity of potash, nitrogen, and phosphoric acid is not required; and
it is not very easy to see how the substitution of the one for the other
should be of much importance in this respect. Indeed, the more minutely
the subject is examined, the more do we become convinced of the
insufficiency of that view which attributes the necessity for a rotation
of crops to differences in chemical composition alone. There can be no
doubt that the nature of the plant and the particular mode in which it
gathers its nutriment, have a most important influence. Certain plants
are almost entirely dependent on the soil for their organic
constituents, while others derive a large proportion of them from the
air, and a plant of the latter class will flourish in a soil in which
one of the former is incapable of growing. In other cases, the structure
and distribution of the roots is the cause of the difference. Some
plants have roots distributed near the surface and exhaust the
superficial layer of the soil, others penetrate into the deeper layers,
and not only derive an abundant supply of food from them, but actually
promote the fertility of the surface soil by the refuse portions of them
which are left upon it. Experience has in this respect arrived at
results which tally with theory, and it is for this reason that the
broad-leafed turnip, which obtains a considerable quantity of its
nutriment from the air, alternates with grain crops which are chiefly
dependent on the soil. It is undoubtedly to some such cause that several
remarkable instances of what may be called natural rotations are to be
attributed. It is well known in Sweden that when a pine forest is
felled, a growth, not of pine but of birch, immediately springs up. Now
the difference in composition of the ash of these trees is not
sufficient to explain this fact, and it must clearly be due to some
difference in the distribution of their roots, or the mode in which they
obtain their food.

Whatever weight may be given to these different explanations of
rotation, there is no doubt about the importance of attending to it, and
there are various practical deductions of much importance to be drawn
from the facts with which we are acquainted. Thus it is to be observed
that the quantities of mineral matters withdrawn by plants of the same
class are generally similar, and hence it may be inferred that crops of
the most opposite class ought as much as possible to alternate with one
another, and each plant should be repeated as seldom as possible, so
that, even when it is necessary to return to the same class, a different
member of it should be employed. Thus, for instance, in place of
immediately repeating wheat, when another grain crop is necessary, it
would theoretically be preferable to employ oats or barley, and to
replace the turnip by mangold-wurzel or some other root. It is obvious,
however, that this system cannot be carried out in practice to its full
extent; for the superior value of individual crops causes the more
frequent repetition of those which make the largest return. But
experience has so far concurred with theory that it has taught the
farmer the advantage of long rotations; and we have seen the successive
introduction of the three, four, five, and six-course shift, and even,
in some instances, of longer periods.

Such is the theory of rotation, and while it will always be most
advantageous to adhere to it, it is by no means necessary that this
should be done in an absolutely rigid manner. In the practice of
agriculture, plants are placed in artificial circumstances, and instead
of allowing them to depend entirely on the soil, they are supplied with
a quantity of manure containing all the elements they require, and if it
be used in sufficiently large quantity, the same crop may be grown year
after year. And accordingly the order of rotation, which is
theoretically the best, may be, and every day is, violated in practice,
although this must necessarily be done at the expense of a certain
quantity of the valuable matters of the manure added, and is so far a
practice which ought theoretically to be avoided. In actual practice,
however, the matter is to be decided on other grounds. The object then
is, not to produce the largest crops, but those which make the largest
money return, and thus it may be practically economical to grow a crop
of high commercial value more frequently than is theoretically
advantageous. In such cases the farmer must seek to do away as far as
possible with the disadvantages which such a course entails, and this he
will endeavour to accomplish by careful management and a liberal
treatment of the soil.

But while this system may be adopted to some extent, it must also be
borne in mind that the frequent repetition of some crops cannot be
practised with impunity, for plants are liable to certain diseases which
manifest themselves to the greatest extent when they have been too often
cultivated in the same soil. Clover sickness, which affects the plant
when frequently repeated on light soils, and the potatoe disease and
finger and toe have been attributed to the same cause. Whether this is
the sole origin of these diseases is questionable, but there is no doubt
that they are aggravated by frequent repetition, and hence a strong
argument in favour of rotation. It has been asserted by great
authorities in high farming, that with our present command of manures,
rotations may be done away with; but this is an opinion to which science
gives no countenance, and he would be a rash man who attempted to carry
it out in practice.




CHAPTER XIV.

THE FEEDING OF FARM STOCK.


The feeding of cattle, once a subordinate part of the operations of the
farm, has now become one of its most important departments, and a large
number of minute and elaborate experiments have been made by chemists
and physiologists with the view of determining the principles on which
its successful and economical practice depends. These investigations,
while they have thrown much light on the matter, have by no means
exhausted it, and it will be readily understood that the complete
elucidation of a subject of such complexity, touching on so many of the
most abstruse and difficult problems of chemistry and physiology, and in
which the experiments are liable to be affected by disturbing causes,
dependent on peculiarities of constitution of different animals, cannot
be otherwise than a slow process.

In considering the principles of feeding, it is necessary to point out,
in the first instance, that the plant and animal are composed of the
same chemical elements, hence the food supplied to the latter invariably
contains all the substances it requires for the maintenance of its
functions. And not only is this the case, but these elements are to a
great extent combined together in a similar manner,--the fibrine,
caseine, albumen, and fatty matters contained in animals corresponding
in all respects with the compounds extracted from plants under the same
name; and though the starchy and saccharine substances do not form any
part of the animal body, they are represented in the milk, the food
which nature has provided for the young animal. It has been frequently
assumed that the nitrogenous and fatty matters are simply absorbed into
the animal system, and deposited unchanged in its tissues; but it is
probable that the course of events is not quite so simple, although,
doubtless, the decomposition which occurs is comparatively trifling. The
starchy matters, on the other hand, are completely changed, and devoted
to purposes which will be immediately explained.

It is a matter of familiar experience, that if the food be properly
proportioned to the requirements of the animal, its weight remains
unchanged; and the inference to be drawn from this fact obviously is,
that the food does not remain permanently in the system, but must be
again got rid of. It escapes partly through the lungs, and partly by the
excretions, which do not consist merely of the part which has not been
digested, but also of that portion which has been absorbed, and after
performing its allotted functions within the system, has become effete
and useless. When the weights of the excretions, the carbon contained in
the carbonic acid expired by the lungs and the small quantity of matter
which escapes in the form of perspiration, are added together, they are
found in such a case to be exactly equal to the food. If the animal be
deprived of nutriment, it immediately begins to lose weight, because its
functions must continue--carbon must still be converted into carbonic
acid to maintain respiration--and the excretions be eliminated, although
diminished in quantity, because they no longer contain the undigested
portion of the daily food, and the substances already stored up in the
body are consumed to maintain the functions of life. Universal
experience has shewn that, under such circumstances, the fat which has
accumulated in various parts of the body disappears, and the animal
becomes lean; but it is less generally recognised that the muscular
flesh, that is the lean part of the body, also diminishes, although it
is sufficiently indicated by the fact that nitrogen still continues to
be found in the urine, and that the animal becomes feeble and incapable
of muscular exertion. Respiration and secretion, in fact, proceed quite
irrespective of the food, which is only required to repair the loss they
occasion. When the course of events within the animal body is traced, it
is found to be somewhat as follows: The food consumed is digested and
absorbed into the blood, where it undergoes a series of complicated
changes, as a consequence of which part of it is converted into carbonic
acid, and eliminated by the lungs, and part is deposited in the tissues
as fat and flesh. After the lapse of a certain period, longer or shorter
according to circumstances, a new set of actions comes into play, by
which the complex constituents of the tissues are resolved into simpler
substances, and excreted chiefly by the lungs and kidneys. The changes
thus produced are, to a great extent, identical with those which would
take place if the fat and flesh were consumed in a fire; and the animal
frame may, in a certain sense, be compared to a furnace, in which, by
the daily consumption of a certain quantity of fuel and air inhaled in
the process of respiration, its temperature is maintained above that of
the surrounding atmosphere. If the daily supply of fuel, that is of
food, be properly adjusted to the loss by combustion, the weight of the
animal remains constant; if it be reduced below this quantity, it
diminishes; but if it be increased, the stomach either refuses to
digest and assimilate the excess, or it is absorbed and stored up in the
body, increasing both the fat and flesh.

When an animal is fed in such a manner that its weight remains constant,
a balance is produced between the supply of nutriment contained in the
food and the waste of the tissues, the gain from the former exactly
counterpoising the loss occasioned by the latter. If in this state of
matters an additional supply of food be given, this balance is deranged,
and the nutriment being in excess of the loss, the animal gains weight,
and it continues to do this for some time, until it reaches a point at
which a new balance is established, and its weight again becomes
constant; and this is due to the fact that the animal becomes subject to
an additional waste, consequent on the increased weight of matter
accumulated in its tissues. If, after the animal has attained its new
constant weight, the food be a second time increased, a further gain is
obtained, and so on, with every addition to the supply of nutriment,
until at length a certain point is reached, beyond which its weight
cannot be forced. In fact, each successive increase of weight is
obtained at a greater expenditure of food. If, for example, a lean
animal is taken, and its food increased by a given quantity, it will
rapidly attain a certain additional weight, but if another extra supply
of food be given, the increase due to it will be much more slowly
attained, and so on until at length an additional increase can only be
secured by the long-continued consumption of a very large quantity of
food. The great object of the feeder is to obtain the greatest possible
increase with the smallest expenditure of food, and to know the point
beyond which it is no longer economical to attempt to force the process
of fattening. To do this it is necessary first to consider the
composition of the animal itself, then that of its food, and lastly, the
mode in which it may be most economically used.

It has been already observed that the animal tissues are composed of
albuminous or nitrogenous compounds, fat, mineral matters, and water;
but the proportions of these substances have, until lately, been very
imperfectly known. Water is well known to be by far the largest
constituent, and amounts in general to about two-thirds of the entire
weight, and it has been generally supposed that the nitrogenous matters
stood next in point of abundance, but a most important and elaborate
series of experiments by Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert have shewn that they
are greatly exceeded by the fatty matters. The following table contains
a summary of the composition of ten different animals in different
stages of fattening. The first division gives the composition of the
carcass, that is, the portion of the animal usually consumed as human
food; the second that of the offal, consisting of the parts not usually
employed as food; and the third that of the entire animals, including
the contents of the stomach and intestines:--

From this table it appears that, in the carcass, the proportion of fat
is, in general, even in lean animals, much greater than that of
nitrogenous compounds. In one case only, that of the fat calf, are they
equal. But in the lean sheep there is more than one and a half times as
much fat as nitrogenous matters, in the half fat sheep twice, in the fat
sheep four times, and in the very fat sheep about six times as much. As
a general result of the analyses it may be stated, that in the carcass
of an ox in good condition, the quantity of fat will be from two to
nearly three times as great as that of the so called albuminous
compounds; in a sheep three or four times, and in the pig four or five
times as great. In the offal, including the hide, intestines, and other
parts not usually consumed as food, the proportion is very
different,--the quantity of fat being much smaller, and that of
nitrogenous compounds considerably larger.

Taking a general average of the whole, the following may be assumed as
representing approximately the general composition of a lean and a fat
animal:--

                                Lean.    Fat.

     Mineral matters              5       3
     Nitrogenous compounds       15      12.5
     Fat                         24      33
     Water                       56      48.5
                                ---     -----
                                100     100.0

The data given in the preceding table, coupled with a knowledge of the
relative weights of the lean and fat animals, enable us to ascertain the
composition of the _increase_ during the fattening process. It is
obvious, from the material diminution of the per centage of water, that
the matters deposited in the tissues must contain a much larger
proportion of dry matters than the whole body; and the reduced per
centage of nitrogenous matters shews that the fat must also greatly
preponderate. This is still more distinctly illustrated by the following
table, giving the per centage composition of the increase in fattening
oxen, sheep, and pigs:--

     ------------------------------------------------
           | Mineral  | Nitrogenous | Fat. | Water. |
           | Matters. |  Compounds. |      |        |
     ------------------------------------------------
     Oxen  |  1.47    |    7.69     | 66.2 |  24.6  |
     Sheep |  2.34    |    7.13     | 70.4 |  20.1  |
     Pigs  |  0.06    |    6.44     | 71.5 |  22.0  |
     ------------------------------------------------

Hence it may be stated in round numbers, that for every pound of
nitrogenous matters added to the weight of a fattening animal, it will
gain ten pounds of fat, and three of water. These are the proportions
over the whole period of fattening, but it is probable that during the
last few weeks of the process the ratio of fat to nitrogenous matters is
still higher.

In considering the composition of the food of animals, it will be
readily admitted that the milk, the nutriment supplied by nature for the
maintenance of the young animal, must afford special instruction as to
its requirements during the early stages of existence, and indicate, at
least, some of the points to be attended to under the altered conditions
of mature life. The following table gives the average composition of the
milk of the most important farm animals:--

                      Cow.    Ewe.    Goat.
     Caseine          3.4     4.50     4.02
     Butter           3.6     4.20     3.32
     Sugar of milk    6.0     5.00     5.28
     Ash              0.2     0.68     0.58
     Water           86.8    85.62    86.80
                   ------   ------   ------
                   100.00   100.00   100.00

In examining these, and all other analyses of food, it is necessary to
draw a distinction between the flesh-forming and the respiratory
elements; the former including the nitrogenous compounds which are used
in the production of flesh, the latter, the non-nitrogenous substances
which produce fat and support the process of respiration. The former,
however much they may differ in name, are nearly or altogether identical
in chemical composition, the latter embracing two great classes--the
fats which exist in the body and the saccharine compounds, including the
different kinds of sugar and starch which are not found in the animal
tissues. It was at one time supposed that these substances were entirely
consumed in the respiratory process, and eliminated by the lungs in the
form of carbonic acid and water, but it has been clearly shewn that they
may be and often are converted into fat, and accumulated in the system.
Careful experiments on bees have demonstrated that when fed on sugar
they continue to produce wax, which is a species of fat, and animals
retain their health and become fat, even when their food contains
scarcely any oil. There is, however, an important difference between
these two classes of substances as regards their fat-producing effect. A
pound of fat contained in the food is capable of producing the same
quantity within the animal; but the case is different with starch and
sugar, the most trustworthy experiments shewing that two and a half
pounds of these substances are necessary for that purpose. Hence we talk
of the fat equivalent of sugar, by which is meant the amount of fat it
is capable of producing, and which is obtained by dividing its quantity
