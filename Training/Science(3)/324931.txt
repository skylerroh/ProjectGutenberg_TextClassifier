    "    in the seeds              0.029   }  2.399
                                             ------
                            Difference        0.035

Hence, the nitrogen contained in the plants must, in this instance, have
been obtained entirely from the nitrate of potash, for the quantity
contained in it and in the seeds is exactly equal to that in the plants
and the soil, the difference of 0.03 grains being so small that it may
be safely attributed to the errors inseparable from such experiments.
For the sake of comparison, an exactly similar experiment was made on
two seeds grown without nitrate of potash, and in this instance, after
an equally long period of growth, the largest plant had only attained a
height of 7.5 inches, and had three small pale and imperfectly developed
leaves. They contained only 0.033 grains of nitrogen, while the seeds
contained 0.032--indicating that, under these circumstances, there was
no increase in the quantity of that element.

But, independently of these experimental results, it may be inferred
from general considerations, that nitric acid must be one of the sources
from which plants derive their nitrogen. It has been already stated,
that the humus contained in the soil consists of the remains of decayed
plants, and there is every reason to suppose that the primeval soil
contained no organic matters, and that the first generation of plants
must have derived the whole of their nitrogen from, the atmosphere. If,
therefore, it be assumed that ammonia is the only source of the
nitrogen of plants, it would follow, that as that substance cannot be
produced by the direct union of its elements, the quantity of ammonia in
the air could only remain undiminished in the event of the whole of the
nitrogen of decaying plants returning into that form. But this is
certainly not the case, for every time a vegetable substance is burned,
part of its nitrogen is liberated in the free state, and in certain
conditions of putrefaction, nitric acid is produced. Now, if ammonia be
the only form in which nitrogen is absorbed, there must be a gradual
diminution of the quantity contained in the air; and further, there must
either be some continuous source of supply by which its quantity is
maintained, or there must be some other substance capable of affording
nitrogen in a form fitted for the maintenance of plant life. As regards
the first alternative, it must be stated that we know of no source other
than the decomposition of plants from which ammonia can be derived, and
we are therefore compelled to adopt the second alternative, and to admit
that there must be some other source of nitrogen, and it cannot be
doubted, from what has been already stated, that it is from nitric acid
only that it can be obtained.

It must be admitted, then, that carbonic acid, ammonia, nitric acid, and
water, are the great organic foods of plants. But while they have
afforded to them an inexhaustible supply of the last, the quantity of
the other three available for food are limited, and insufficient to
sustain their life for a prolonged period. It has been shown by
Chevandrier, that an acre of land under beech wood accumulates annually
about 1650 lb. of carbon. Now, the column of air resting upon an acre of
land contains only about 15,500 lb. of carbon, and the soil may be
estimated to contain 1 per cent., or 22,400 lb. per acre, and the whole
of this carbon would therefore be removed, both from the air and the
soil, in the course of little more than 23 years. But it is a familiar
fact, that plants continue to grow with undiminished luxuriance year
after year in the same soil, and they do so because neither their carbon
nor their nitrogen are permanently absorbed; they are there only for a
period, and when the plant has finished its functions, and dies, they
sooner or later return into their original state. Either the plant
decays, in which case its carbon and nitrogen pass more or less rapidly
into their original state, or it becomes the food of animals, and by the
processes of respiration and secretion, the same change is indirectly
effected. In this way a sort of balance is sustained; the carbon, which
at one moment is absorbed by the plant, passes in the next into the
tissues of the animal, only to be again expired in that state in which
it is fitted to commence again its round of changes.

But while there is thus a continuous circulation of these constituents
through both plants and animals, there are various changes which tend to
liberate in the free state a certain quantity both of the carbon and
nitrogen of plants, and these being thus removed from the sphere of
organic life, there would be a gradual diminution in the amount of
vegetation at the earth's surface, unless this loss were counterbalanced
by some corresponding source of gain. In regard to carbonic acid the
most important source is volcanic action, but the loss of nitrogen,
which is far more important and considerable, is restored by the direct
combination of its elements. The formation of nitric acid during thunder
storms has been long familiar; but it would appear from the recent
experiments of Cloeez, which, should they be confirmed by farther
enquiry, will be of much importance, that this compound is also
produced without electrical action when air is passed over certain
porous substances, saturated with alkaline and earthy compounds.
Fragments of calcined brick and pumice stone were saturated with
solution of carbonate of potash, with carbonates of lime and magnesia
and other mixtures, and a current of air freed from nitric acid and
ammonia passed over them for a long period, at the end of which notable
quantities of nitric acid were detected.

_Source of the Inorganic Constituents of Plants._--The inorganic
constituents of plants being all fixed substances, it is sufficiently
obvious that they can only be obtained from the soil, which, as we shall
afterwards see, contains all of them in greater or less abundance, and
has always been admitted to be the only substance capable of supplying
them. The older chemists and physiologists, however, attributed no
importance to these substances, and from the small quantities in which
they are found in plants, imagined that they were there merely
accidental impurities absorbed from the soil along with the humus, which
was at that time considered to be their organic food. This opinion,
sufficiently disproved by the constant occurrence of the same substances
in nearly the same proportions, in the ash of each individual plant, has
been further refuted by the experiments of Prince Salm Horstmar, who has
established their importance to vegetation, by experiments upon oats
grown on artificial soils, in each of which one inorganic constituent
was omitted. He found that, without silica, the grain vegetated, but
remained small, pale in colour, and so weak as to be incapable of
supporting itself; without lime, it died when it had produced its second
leaf; without potash and soda, it grew only to the height of three
inches; without magnesia, it was weak and incapable of supporting
itself; without phosphoric acid, weak but upright; and without sulphuric
acid, though normal in form, the plant was feeble, and produced no
fruit.

_Manner in which the Constituents of Plants are absorbed._--Having
treated of the sources of the elements of plants, it is necessary to
direct attention to the mode in which they enter their system.

_Water._--The absorption of water by plants takes place in great
abundance, and is connected with many of the most important phenomena of
vegetation. It is principally absorbed by the roots, and passes into the
tissues of the plant, where a part of it is decomposed, and goes to the
formation of certain of its organic compounds; while by far the larger
quantity, in place of remaining in it, is again exhaled by the leaves.
The extent to which this takes place is very large. Hales found that a
sunflower exhaled in twelve hours about 1 lb. 5 oz. of water, but this
quantity was liable to considerable variation, being greater in dry, and
less in wet weather, and much diminished during the night. Saussure made
similar experiments, and observed that the quantity of water exhaled by
a sunflower amounted to about 220 lb. in four months. The exhalation of
plants has recently been examined with great accuracy by Lawes. His
experiments were made by planting single plants of wheat, barley, beans,
peas, and clover, in large glass jars capable of holding about 42 lb. of
soil, and covered with glass plates, furnished with a hole in the centre
for the passage of the stem of the plant. Water was supplied to the soil
at certain intervals, and the jars were carefully weighed. The result of
the experiments, continued during a period of 172 days, is given in the
following table, which shows the total quantity of water exhaled in
grains:--

Wheat                    113,527
Barley                   120,025
Beans                    112,231
Peas                     109,082
Clover, cut 28th June     55,093

It further appears, that the exhalation is not uniform, but increases
during the active growth of the plant, and diminishes again when that
period is passed. These variations are shown by the subjoined tables, of
which the first gives the total exhalation, and the second the average
daily loss of water during certain periods.

Similar experiments were made with the same plants in soils to which
certain manures had been added, and with results generally similar.
Calculating from these experiments, we are led to the apparently
anomalous conclusion that the quantity of water exhaled by the plants
growing on an acre of land greatly exceeds the annual fall of rain;
although it is obvious that of all the rain which falls, only a small
proportion can be absorbed by the plants growing on the soil, for a
large quantity is carried off by the rivers, and never reaches their
roots. It has been calculated, for instance, that the Thames carries off
in this way at least one-third of the annual rain that falls in the
district watered by it, and the Rhine nearly four-fifths. Of course this
large exhalation must depend on the repeated absorption of the same
quantity of water, which, after being exhaled, is again deposited on the
soil in the form of dew, and passes repeatedly through the plant. This
constant percolation of water is of immense importance to the plant, as
it forms the channel through which some of its other constituents are
carried to it.

_Carbonic Acid._--While the larger part of the water which a plant
requires is absorbed by its roots, the reverse is the case with carbonic
acid. A certain proportion no doubt is carried up through the roots by
the water, which always contains a quantity of that gas in solution, but
by far the larger proportion is directly absorbed from the air by the
leaves. A simple experiment of Boussingault's illustrates this
absorption very strikingly. He took a large glass globe having three
apertures, through one of which he introduced the branch of a vine, with
twenty leaves on it. With one of the side apertures a tube was
connected, by means of which the air could be drawn slowly through the
globe, and into an apparatus in which its carbonic acid was accurately
determined. He found, in this way, that while the air which entered the
globe contained 0.0004 of carbonic acid, that which escaped contained
only 0.0001, so that three-fourths of the carbonic acid had been
absorbed.

_Ammonia and Nitric Acid._--Little is known regarding the mode in which
these substances enter the plant. It is usually supposed that they are
entirely absorbed by the roots, and no doubt the greater proportion is
taken up in this way, but it is very probable that they may also be
absorbed by the leaves, at least the addition of ammonia to the air in
which plants are grown, materially accelerates vegetation. It is
probable, however, that the rain carries down the ammonia to the roots,
and there is no doubt that that derived from the decomposition of the
nitrogenous matters in the soil is so absorbed.

_Inorganic Constituents._--The inorganic constituents of course are
entirely absorbed by the roots; and it is as a solvent for them that the
large quantity of water continually passing through the plants is so
important. They exist in the soil in particular states of combination,
in which they are scarcely soluble in water. But their solubility is
increased by the presence of carbonic acid contained in the water, and
which causes it to dissolve, to some extent, substances otherwise
insoluble. It is in this way that lime, which occurs in the soil
principally as the insoluble carbonate, is dissolved and absorbed. And
phosphate of lime is also taken up by water containing carbonic acid, or
even common salt in solution. The amount of solubility produced by these
substances is extremely small; but it is sufficient for the purpose of
supplying to the plant as much of its mineral constituents as are
required, for the quantity of water which, as we have already seen,
passes through a plant is very large when compared with the amount of
inorganic matters absorbed. It has been shown by Lawes and Gilbert, that
about 2000 grains of water pass through a plant for every grain of
mineral matter fixed in it, so that there is no difficulty in
understanding how the absorption takes place.

It is worthy of notice, however, that the absorption of the elements of
plants takes place even though they may not be in solution in the soil,
the roots apparently possessing the power of directly acting on and
dissolving insoluble matters; but a distinction must be drawn between
this and the view entertained by Jethro Tull, who supposed that they
might be absorbed in the solid state, provided they were reduced to a
state of sufficient comminution. It is now no longer doubted that,
whatever action the roots may exert, the constituents of the plant must
be in solution before they can pass into it--experiment having
distinctly shown that the spongioles or apertures through which this
absorption takes place are too minute to admit even the smallest solid
particle.




CHAPTER II.

THE PROXIMATE CONSTITUENTS OF PLANTS.


The substances absorbed by the plant, which are of simple composition,
and contain only two elements, are elaborated within it, and converted
into the many complicated compounds of which its mass is composed. Some
of these, as, for example, the colouring matters of madder and indigo,
the narcotic principle of the poppy, &c., are confined to a single
species, or small group of plants, while others are found in all plants,
and form the main bulk of their tissues. The latter are the only
substances which claim notice in a treatise like the present. They have
been divided into three great classes, of widely different properties,
composition, and functions.

_1st. The Saccharine and Amylaceous Constituents._--These substances are
compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and all possess a certain
degree of similarity in composition, the quantities of hydrogen and
oxygen they contain being always in the proportion required to form
water, so that they may be considered as compounds of carbon and water;
not that it can be asserted that they actually do contain water, as
such, for of that there is no evidence, but only that its elements are
present in the proportion to form it.

_Cellulose._--This substance forms the fundamental part of all plants.
It is the principal constituent of woody fibre, and is found in a state
of purity in the fibre of cotton and flax, and in the pith of plants;
but in wood it is generally contaminated with another substance, which
has received the name incrusting matter, because it is deposited in and
around the cells of which the plant is in part composed. Cellulose is
insoluble in all menstrua, but, when boiled for a long time with
sulphuric acid, is converted into a substance called dextrine. Cellulose
consists of--

           From pith of Elder-tree.  Spongioles of roots.

Carbon              43.37                43.00
Hydrogen             6.04                 6.18
Oxygen              50.59                50.82
                  -------              -------
                   100.00               100.00

It is represented chemically by the formula, C_{24}H_{21}O_{21}, which
shows it to be a compound of 24 atoms of carbon with 21 of hydrogen and
21 of oxygen.

_Incrusting matter._--Large quantities of this substance enter into the
composition of all plants. Of its chemical nature little is known, as it
cannot be obtained separate from cellulose, but it is analogous to that
substance in its composition, and probably contains hydrogen and oxygen
in the proportion to form water.

_Starch._--Starch is one of the most abundant constituents of plants,
and is found in most seeds, as those of the cereals and the leguminous
plants; in the tubers of the potatoe, the bulbs of tulips, &c. &c. It is
obtained by placing a quantity of wheat flour in a bag, and kneading it
under a gentle stream of water. When the water is allowed to stand, it
deposits the starch as a fine white powder, which, when examined by the
microscope, is found to be composed of minute grains, formed of
concentric layers deposited on one another. These grains vary
considerably in size and structure in different plants; but in the same
plant they are generally so much alike as to admit of their recognition
by a practised observer. They were formerly believed to be composed of
an external coating of a substance insoluble in water, and containing in
their interior a soluble kernel; but this opinion has been refuted, and
distinct evidence been brought to show that the exterior and interior of
the globules are identical in chemical properties. Starch is insoluble
in cold water, but by boiling, it dissolves, forming a thick paste. By
long continued boiling with water containing a small quantity of acid,
it is completely dissolved and converted into dextrine, and eventually
into sugar. The same change is produced by the action of fermenting
substances, such as the extract of malt; when heated in the dry state to
a temperature of about 390 Fahr., it becomes soluble in cold water. It
is distinguished by giving a brilliant blue compound with iodine. Starch
contains--

     Carbon    44.47
     Hydrogen   6.28
     Oxygen    49.25
              ------
              100.00

and its composition is represented by the formula C_{12}H_{10}O_{10}, so
that it differs but little from cellulose in composition, although its
chemical functions in the plant are extremely different. It is connected
with some of the most important changes which occur in the growing
plants, and by a series of remarkable transformations is converted into
sugar and other important compounds.

_Lichen Starch_ is found in most species of lichens, and is
distinguished from common starch by producing a green colour with
iodine. Its composition is the same as that of ordinary starch.

_Inuline._--The species of starch to which this name is given is
characterised by its dissolving in boiling water, and giving a white
pulverulent deposit in cooling. It is found in the tuber of the dahlia,
in the dandelion, and some other plants. Its composition is identical
with that of cellulose, and its formula is C_{24}H_{21}O_{21}.

_Gum_ is excreted from various plants as a thick fluid, which dries up
into transparent masses. Its composition is identical with that of
starch. It dissolves readily in cold water, and is converted into sugar
by long continued boiling with acids. Its properties are best marked in
gum arabic, which is obtained from various species of acacia; that from
other plants differs to some extent, although its chemical composition
is the same.

_Dextrine._--When starch is exposed to a heat of about 400 deg., or when
treated with sulphuric acid, or with a substance extracted from malt
called _diastase_, it is converted into dextrine. It may also be
obtained from cellulose by a similar treatment. The dextrine so obtained
has the same composition as the starch from which it is produced, but
its properties more nearly resemble those of gum. It plays a very
important part in the process of germination, and may be converted into
sugar on the one hand, and apparently also into starch on the other.

_Sugar._--Under this name are included four or five distinct substances,
of which the most important are, cane sugar, grape sugar, and the
