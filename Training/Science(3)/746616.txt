Julius Schwartz--who is probably the greatest living authority on all
existing science fiction, and who worships Dr. Keller--don't we all?

Michael Fogaris--who holds one of the most brilliant scholastic
records held by any s-f fan, and who idolizes the writings of A.
Merritt--again, don't we all?

Milton Kaletsky--who is the world's greatest torture fiend. He coerced
his sister into typing up his first s-f story, the 16,000 word "Visit
to Alpha Centauri."

Nathan Greenfeld, who, besides being a devout s-f fan, is quite adept
at painting.
