THE GUARDIAN.

     "The selection and judgment throughout is excellent. The
     book is a most useful, practical adjunct to any good
     text-book on organic chemistry."

PHARMACEUTICAL REVIEW.

     "This is a book that should be in the library of every
     teacher of organic chemistry, and one which will no doubt be
     of great value to students in their second year of organic
     chemistry. Its chief peculiarity and merit is in the great
     stress laid on practical laboratory work.... It is
     permanently a worker's guide."

NATURE.

     "Since the advance of organic chemistry in this country
     must, in a measure, depend on the nature of the available
     text-books, both the author and the translator deserve our
     thanks for providing us with a work such as the present
     one."

JAMES LEWIS HOWE,

_Department of Chemistry, Washington and Lee University._

     "The book is brought thoroughly up to date, and in some
     cases the lines of probable development are nicely
     foreshadowed. The descriptions are particularly lucid and
     the illustrations well selected.

     The general arrangement and make-up of the book is
     excellent, and ... altogether the book fills well a need
     long felt by teachers of Industrial Chemistry.

     I shall adopt the book for my class and shall take pleasure
     in recommending it."

CHARLES E. COATES, Jr., Ph.D.,

_Professor of Chemistry, Louisiana State University._

     "I have examined it carefully and think it a most excellent
     book, meeting a want I have long felt in my higher classes.
     I have introduced it in this year's classes."

W. A. NOYES, in _Science_.

     "The descriptions of processes, while necessarily concise,
     are clear and interesting. The author has evidently made a
     careful study of recent methods of manufacture as well as of
     older, standard processes. The frequent reference to
     American practice is an important feature which
     distinguishes the book from other works on chemical
     technology. A select bibliography follows each subject, and
     will be found very useful."
