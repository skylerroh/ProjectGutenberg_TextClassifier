
Fern's smile was compassionate. She methodically ground the ashes to
powder, lifted that calm green gaze.

"Stupid words to frighten children, Jake. Yes, they kidnapped me. I
never reached Earth, three months ago. I was indoctrinated--oh, they
didn't have far to go. _Each race to its own fulfillment._" Her eyes
were shining. "Look out the window."

Numbly, I moved past her. I stared. In the distant blackness, a column
of living flame flickered up the slope of Cobalt Mountain. Ice-green,
ruby, silver and blue. The Terms were leaving.

"They're not ready for individuality yet," Fern breathed. "In a million
years perhaps. Not now. They're going home."

"To die."

"The race will live. Individuality isn't the penultimate, darling.
You'll find out." I moved towards her. "You've got a very tough mind,
Jake. You'll make a wonderful Guild agent--"

I got both hands on her throat.

Fern moved. Her right arm was a snake striking, and a steel strength
lifted me, turning, against one and a half gravities, and the floor
wavered up to hit me in the face. Something broke. I tasted blood.

Through the agony, I moved. I crawled towards her.

"They gave me six weeks of hand combat under two gravs," she said. "Soon
you'll be one of us, Jake. One of the Guild!"

I stared up at her in a dull horror. I kept crawling.

"We'll heal you," Fern said. "We'll give you back the dream. We may even
work together! Maybe I'll fall in love with you again, who knows?" Her
eyes were brimming. She took out a sonic pistol. "It's all right,
darling. I'll adjust it for knockout. In three hours we'll be on a Guild
flier. Please, darling," she said, and I kept crawling. And Fern's smile
was a benediction as she pulled the trigger.
