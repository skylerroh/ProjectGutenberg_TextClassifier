atmosphere, leaving a luminous train behind it. It almost disappeared,
and on April 26th it was of the sixteenth magnitude; but on August
17th it brightened to the tenth, showing the principal nebular band in
its spectrum, and no sign of approach or recession.  It was as if it
emerged from one part of the nebula, cooled down, and rushed through
another part of the nebula, rendering the nebular gas more luminous
than itself.[20]

Since 1892 one Nova after another has shown a spectrum as described
above, like a meteor rushing towards us and leaving a train behind,
for this seems to be the obvious meaning of the spectra.

The same may be said of the brilliant Nova Persei, brighter at its
best than Capella, and discovered also by Dr. Anderson on February
22nd, 1901. It increased in brightness as it reached the densest part
of the nebula, then it varied for some weeks by a couple of
magnitudes, up and down, as if passing through separate nebular
condensations. In February, 1902, it could still be seen with an
opera-glass. As with the other Novae, when it first dashed into the
nebula it was vaporised and gave a continuous spectrum with dark lines
of hydrogen and helium. It showed no bright lines paired with the dark
ones to indicate a train left behind; but in the end its own
luminosity died out, and the nebular spectrum predominated.

The nebular illumination as seen in photographs, taken from August to
November, seemed to spread out slowly in a gradually increasing circle
at the rate of 90" in forty-eight days. Kapteyn put this down to the
velocity of light, the original outburst sending its illumination to
the nebulous gas and illuminating a spherical shell whose radius
increased at the velocity of light. This supposition seems correct, in
which case it can easily be shown from the above figures that the
distance of this Nova was 300 light years.

_Star Catalogues._--Since the days of very accurate observations
numerous star-catalogues have been produced by individuals or by
observatories. Bradley's monumental work may be said to head the list.
Lacaille's, in the Southern hemisphere, was complementary.  Then
Piazzi, Lalande, Groombridge, and Bessel were followed by Argelander
with his 324,000 stars, Rumker's Paramatta catalogue of the southern
hemisphere, and the frequent catalogues of national observatories.
Later the Astronomische Gesellschaft started their great catalogue,
the combined work of many observatories. Other southern ones were
Gould's at Cordova and Stone's at the Cape.

After this we have a new departure. Gill at the Cape, having the comet
1882.ii. all to himself in those latitudes, wished his friends in
Europe to see it, and employed a local photographer to strap his
camera to the observatory equatoreal, driven by clockwork, and
adjusted on the comet by the eye. The result with half-an-hour's
exposure was good, so he tried three hours. The result was such a
display of sharp star images that he resolved on the Cape Photographic
Durchmusterung, which after fourteen years, with Kapteyn's aid in
reducing, was completed. Meanwhile the brothers Henry, of Paris, were
engaged in going over Chacornac's zodiacal stars, and were about to
catalogue the Milky Way portion, a serious labour, when they saw
Gill's Comet photograph and conceived the idea of doing the rest of
their work by photography.  Gill had previously written to Admiral
Mouchez, of the Paris Observatory, and explained to him his project
for charting the heavens photographically, by combining the work of
many observatories. This led Admiral Mouchez to support the brothers
Henry in their scheme.[21] Gill, having got his own photographic work
underway, suggested an international astrographic chart, the materials
for different zones to be supplied by observatories of all nations,
each equipped with similar photographic telescopes. At a conference in
Paris, 1887, this was decided on, the stars on the charts going down
to the fourteenth magnitude, and the catalogues to the eleventh.

[Illustration: GREAT COMET, Nov. 14TH, 1882. (Exposure 2hrs. 20m.)  By
kind permission of Sir David Gill. From this photograph originated all
stellar chart-photography.]

This monumental work is nearing completion. The labour involved was
immense, and the highest skill was required for devising instruments
and methods to read off the star positions from the plates.

Then we have the Harvard College collection of photographic plates,
always being automatically added to; and their annex at Arequipa in
Peru.

Such catalogues vary in their degree of accuracy; and fundamental
catalogues of standard stars have been compiled. These require
extension, because the differential methods of the heliometer and the
camera cannot otherwise be made absolute.

The number of stars down to the fourteenth magnitude may be taken at
about 30,000,000; and that of all the stars visible in the greatest
modern telescopes is probably about 100,000,000.

_Nebulae and Star-clusters._--Our knowledge of nebulae really dates from
the time of W. Herschel. In his great sweeps of the heavens with his
giant telescopes he opened in this direction a new branch of
astronomy.  At one time he held that all nebulae might be clusters of
innumerable minute stars at a great distance. Then he recognised the
different classes of nebulae, and became convinced that there is a
widely-diffused "shining fluid" in space, though many so-called nebulae
could be resolved by large telescopes into stars.  He considered that
the Milky Way is a great star cluster, whose form may be conjectured
from numerous star-gaugings. He supposed that the compact "planetary
nebulae" might show a stage of evolution from the diffuse nebulae, and
that his classifications actually indicate various stages of
development. Such speculations, like those of the ancients about the
solar system, are apt to be harmful to true progress of knowledge
unless in the hands of the ablest mathematical physicists; and
Herschel violated their principles in other directions. But here his
speculations have attracted a great deal of attention, and, with
modifications, are accepted, at least as a working hypothesis, by a
fair number of people.

When Sir John Herschel had extended his father's researches into the
Southern Hemisphere he was also led to the belief that some nebulae
were a phosphorescent material spread through space like fog or mist.

Then his views were changed by the revelations due to the great
discoveries of Lord Rosse with his gigantic refractor,[22] when one
nebula after another was resolved into a cluster of minute stars. At
that time the opinion gained ground that with increase of telescopic
power this would prove to be the case with all nebulae.

In 1864 all doubt was dispelled by Huggins[23] in his first examination
of the spectrum of a nebula, and the subsequent extension of this
observation to other nebulae; thus providing a certain test which
increase in the size of telescopes could never have given. In 1864
Huggins found that all true nebulae give a spectrum of bright
lines. Three are due to hydrogen; two (discovered by Copeland) are
helium lines; others are unknown. Fifty-five lines have been
photographed in the spectrum of the Orion nebula. It seems to be
pretty certain that all true nebulae are gaseous, and show almost
exactly the same spectrum.

Other nebulae, and especially the white ones like that in Andromeda,
which have not yet been resolved into stars, show a continuous
spectrum; others are greenish and give no lines.

A great deal has to be done by the chemist before the astronomer can
be on sure ground in drawing conclusions from certain portions of his
spectroscopic evidence.

The light of the nebulas is remarkably actinic, so that photography
has a specially fine field in revealing details imperceptible in the
telescope. In 1885 the brothers Henry photographed, round the star
Maia in the Pleiades, a spiral nebula 3' long, as bright on the plate
as that star itself, but quite invisible in the telescope; and an
exposure of four hours revealed other new nebula in the same
district. That painstaking and most careful observer, Barnard, with
101/4 hours' exposure, extended this nebulosity for several degrees,
and discovered to the north of the Pleiades a huge diffuse nebulosity,
in a region almost destitute of stars. By establishing a 10-inch
instrument at an altitude of 6,000 feet, Barnard has revealed the wide
distribution of nebular matter in the constellation Scorpio over a
space of 4 deg. or 5 deg. square.  Barnard asserts that the "nebular
hypothesis" would have been killed at its birth by a knowledge of
these photographs. Later he has used still more powerful instruments,
and extended his discoveries.

The association of stars with planetary nebulae, and the distribution
of nebulae in the heavens, especially in relation to the Milky Way, are
striking facts, which will certainly bear fruit when the time arrives
for discarding vague speculations, and learning to read the true
physical structure and history of the starry universe.

_Stellar Spectra._--When the spectroscope was first available for
stellar research, the leaders in this branch of astronomy were Huggins
and Father Secchi,[24] of Rome. The former began by devoting years of
work principally to the most accurate study of a few stars.  The
latter devoted the years from 1863 to 1867 to a general survey of the
whole heavens, including 4,000 stars. He divided these into four
principal classes, which have been of the greatest service. Half of
his stars belonged to the first class, including Sirius, Vega,
Regulus, Altair. The characteristic feature of their spectra is the
strength and breadth of the hydrogen lines and the extreme faintness
of the metallic lines. This class of star is white to the eye, and
rich in ultra violet light.

The second class includes about three-eighths of his stars, including
Capella, Pollux, and Arcturus. These stars give a spectrum like that
of our sun, and appear yellowish to the eye.

The third class includes alpha Herculis, alpha Orionis (Betelgeux), Mira
Ceti, and about 500 red and variable stars.  The spectrum has fluted
bands shaded from blue to red, and sharply defined at the more
refrangible edge.

The fourth class is a small one, containing no stars over fifth
magnitude, of which 152 Schjellerup, in Canes Venatici, is a good
example. This spectrum also has bands, but these are shaded on the
violet side and sharp on the red side. They are due to carbon in some
form.  These stars are ruby red in the telescope.

It would appear, then, that all stars are suns with continuous
spectra, and the classes are differentiated by the character of the
absorbent vapours of their atmospheres.

It is very likely that, after the chemists have taught us how to
interpret all the varieties of spectrum, it will be possible to
ascribe the different spectrum-classes to different stages in the
life-history of every star.  Already there are plenty of people ready
to lay down arbitrary assumptions about the lessons to be drawn from
stellar spectra. Some say that they know with certainty that each star
begins by being a nebula, and is condensed and heated by condensation
until it begins to shine as a star; that it attains a climax of
temperature, then cools down, and eventually becomes extinct.  They go
so far as to declare that they know what class of spectrum belongs to
each stage of a star's life, and how to distinguish between one that
is increasing and another that is decreasing in temperature.

The more cautious astronomers believe that chemistry is not
sufficiently advanced to justify all of these deductions; that, until
chemists have settled the lately raised question of the transmutation
of elements, no theory can be sure. It is also held that until they
have explained, without room for doubt, the reasons for the presence
of some lines, and the absence of others, of any element in a stellar
spectrum; why the arc-spectrum of each element differs from its spark
spectrum; what are all the various changes produced in the spectrum of
a gas by all possible concomitant variations of pressure and
temperature; also the meanings of all the flutings in the spectra of
metalloids and compounds; and other equally pertinent matters--until
that time arrives the part to be played by the astronomer is one of
observation. By all means, they say, make use of "working hypotheses"
to add an interest to years of laborious research, and to serve as a
guide to the direction of further labours; but be sure not to fall
into the error of calling any mere hypothesis a theory.

_Nebular Hypothesis._--The Nebular Hypothesis, which was first, as it
were, tentatively put forward by Laplace as a note in his _Systeme du
Monde_, supposes the solar system to have been a flat, disk-shaped
nebula at a high temperature in rapid rotation. In cooling it
condensed, leaving revolving rings at different distances from the
centre. These themselves were supposed to condense into the nucleus
for a rotating planet, which might, in contracting, again throw off
rings to form satellites.  The speculation can be put in a really
attractive form, but is in direct opposition to many of the actual
facts; and so long as it is not favoured by those who wish to maintain
the position of astronomy as the most exact of the sciences--exact in
its facts, exact in its logic--this speculation must be recorded by
the historian, only as he records the guesses of the ancient Greeks--as
an interesting phase in the history of human thought.

Other hypotheses, having the same end in view, are the meteoritic
hypothesis of Lockyer and the planetesimal hypothesis that has been
largely developed in the United States. These can best be read in the
original papers to various journals, references to which may be found
in the footnotes of Miss Clerke's _History of Astronomy during the
Nineteenth Century_. The same can be said of Bredichin's hypothesis of
comets' tails, Arrhenius's book on the applications of the theory of
light repulsion, the speculations on radium, the origin of the sun's
heat and the age of the earth, the electron hypothesis of terrestrial
magnetism, and a host of similar speculations, all combining to throw
an interesting light on the evolution of a modern train of thought
that seems to delight in conjecture, while rebelling against that
strict mathematical logic which has crowned astronomy as the queen of
the sciences.
