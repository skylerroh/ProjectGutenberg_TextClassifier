      Will not happen again. Regret also imperfect grasp of
      language, learned through what you term Television etc.
      Animal not dangerous, but observe some accidental damage
      caused, therefore hasten to enclose reimbursement, having
      taken liberty of studying your highly ingenious methods of
      exchange. Hope same will be adequate, having estimated
      deplorable inconvenience to best of ability. Regret
      exceedingly impossibility of communicating further, as
      pressure of time and prior obligations forbids. Please accept
      heartfelt apologies and assurances of continuing esteem.

The reimbursement was in fact properly enclosed with the plaque, and may
be seen by the public in the rotunda of the restoration of Radio City.
Though technically counterfeit, it looks like perfectly good money,
except that Mr. Lincoln is missing one of his wrinkles and the words
"FIVE DOLLARS" are upside down.
