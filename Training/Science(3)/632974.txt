Color, brass-yellow. Lustre, metallic. Occurs commonly in cubes. It
often contains small quantities of Au, Ag, Cu, As, Co, and Mn. Heated in
an ignition tube gives a sublimate of sulphur, the residue becoming
magnetic. Before the Bp. on Ch. in O. F. sulphur is burned off and the
red oxide remains. This residue may then be examined for iron, etc.


~Marcasite~ (White Iron Pyrites).--Having the same general composition as
pyrite, but much lighter in color. Crystals, prismatic. Before the Bp.
on Ch. behaves like pyrite.


~Pyrrhotite~, Fe_{7}S_{8}, Fe . 60.5, S . 39.5.--

    H = 3.5-4.5, G = 4.58-4.64.

Color, bronze-yellow. Closely resembles pyrite, but may be distinguished
from it by being feebly magnetic. Heated in an ignition tube yields no
sublimate. Before the Bp. on Ch. fuses to a magnetic globule, which
exhibits a yellowish crystalline structure when fractured.


~Mispickel~, FeAsS, Fe . 34, As . 46, S . 20.--H = 5.5-6.0, G = 6.0-6.2.
Color, silver-white. Lustre, metallic; very brittle. Often associated
with it we find small quantities of Co, Ag, and Au. Heated in an
ignition tube it first yields a red sublimate of sulphide of arsenic,
and then afterward a crystalline sublimate of metallic arsenic. Before
the Bp. on Ch. emits dense fumes of arsenic and deposits a coating on
the coal; it then fuses to a globule which behaves like pyrrhotite.


~Siderite~, FeCO_{3}, FeO . 62, CO_{2} . 38.--H = 3.5-4.5, G = 3.7-3.9.
Color, grayish yellow to reddish brown. Lustre, pearly. Crystallizes in
rhombohedrons with curved faces; these crystals are distinctly cleavable
and massive. Heated in an ignition tube it decrepitates with evolution
of carbon dioxide. Before the Bp. on Ch. infusible. Before the Bp. on
Ch. with Na_{2}CO_{3} it fuses to a magnetic mass. With borax bead it
reacts for iron and sometimes for manganese.


ORES OF LEAD

~Galena~, PbS, Pb . 87, S . 13.--

    H = 2.5, G = 7.4-7.6.

Color, bluish gray, slowly tarnishing. Lustre, metallic. Crystals in the
form of cubes. Heated in an ignition tube it sometimes decrepitates and
yields a sublimate of sulphur. Before the Bp. on Ch. easily reduced to
the metallic state, the Ch. becoming coated with sulphate and oxide of
lead. The metallic globule usually contains a little silver. To separate
this, the process known as "cupellation" is employed. A hole is bored
into the Ch. about 1 cm. in diameter and about 6 mm. deep. Into this
hole is placed a stiff paste made by mixing finely pulverized bone-ash
with a little soda and water. This paste is pressed in hard, and then
the surface is smoothed off, and the centre is slightly depressed with
the rounded end of a glass rod. The charcoal so prepared is set in a
warm place to allow the paste to dry. When the paste is quite dry the
small globule of lead is placed in the depression in the centre of the
bone-ash "cupel," and is there exposed to the O. F. from the Bp. The
lead is oxidized and is absorbed by the bone-ash, while any silver
present will remain in the central depression as a bright shining bead.

opaque. Before the Bp. on Ch. with Na_{2}CO_{3} is reduced to the metal
giving a yellow coating. The Na_{2}CO_{3} absorbed by the coal reacts
for S.
