gun in the viewscreen, the scheme to sabotage the elevator, the scheme
to introduce assassins into the orchestra with guns built into their
trumpets--every one came to your notice because of what seemed to be
some indiscretion of the plotters, didn't it?"

"Why ... why, yes, Your Majesty!" By this time tomorrow, he would have a
complete set of memories for each one of them. "You mean, the
indiscretions were deliberate?"

"Your vigilance and loyalty made it necessary for them to resort to
these fantastic expedients, and your vigilance defeated them as fast as
they came to your notice. Well, today, Prince Travann and I struck back.
I may tell you, in confidence, that every one of the conspirators is
dead. Killed in this afternoon's rioting--which was incited for that
purpose by Prince Travann."

"Then---- Then there will be no more plots against your life?" There was
a note of regret in the old man's voice.

"No more, Your Venerable Highness."

"But---- What did Your Majesty call me?" he asked incredulously.

"I took the honor of being the first to address you by your new title,
Prince-Counselor Dorflay."

He left the old man overcome, and blubbering happily on the shoulder of
the Crown Prince, who winked at his father out of the screen. Prince
Travann had gotten a couple of fresh drinks from the robot and handed
one to him when he returned to his chair.

"He'll be finding the Bench of Counselors riddled with treason inside a
week," Travann said. "You handled that just right, though. Another case
of making problems solve each other."

"You were telling me about a plot you'd discovered."

"Oh, yes: this is one to top Dorflay's best efforts. All the voting-bloc
bosses on Odin are in a conspiracy to start a civil war to give them a
chance to loot the planet. There isn't a word of truth in it, of course,
but it'll do to arrest and hold them for a few days, and by that time
some of my undercovers will be in control of every nonworker vote on the
planet. After all, the Cartels put an end to competition in every other
business; why not a Voting Cartel, too? Then, whenever there's an
election, we just advertise for bids."

"Why, that would mean absolute control----"

"Of the nonworking vote, yes. And I'll guarantee, personally, that in
five years the politics of Odin will have become so unbearably corrupt
and abusive that the intellectuals, the technicians, the business
people, even the nobility, will be flocking to the polls to vote, and if
only half of them turn out, they'll snow the nonworkers under. And
that'll mean, eventually, an end to vote-selling, and the nonworkers'll
have to find work. We'll find it for them."

"Great and frightening changes." Yorn Travann laughed; he recognized the
phrase. Probably started it himself. Paul lifted his glass. "To the
Minister of Disturbance!"

"Your Majesty!" They drank to each other, and then Yorn Travann said,
"We had a lot of wild dreams, when we were boys; it looks as though
we're starting to make some of them come true. You know, when we were in
the University, the students would never have done what they did today.
They didn't even do it ten years ago, when Vann Evaratt was dismissed."

"And Van Evaratt's pupil came back to Odin and touched this whole thing
off." He thought for a moment. "I wonder what Faress has, in that
anticipation effect."

"I think I can see what can come out of it. If he can propagate a wave
that behaves like those micropositos, we may not have to depend on ships
for communication. We may be able, some day, to screen Baldur or Vishnu
or Aton or Thor as easily as you screened Dorflay, up in the mountains."
He thought silently for a moment. "I don't know whether that would be
good or bad. But it would be new, and that's what matters. That's the
only thing that matters."

"Flower Festivals," Paul said, and, when Yorn Travann wanted to know
what he meant, he told him. "When Princess Olva's Empress, she's going
to curse the name of Klenn Faress. Flower Festivals, all around the
galaxy, without end."
