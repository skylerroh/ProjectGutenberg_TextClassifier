
Gangnet smiled too. "How could it?"

"I have lost my will; I feel as if some foul tumour had been scraped
away, leaving me clean and free."

"Do you now understand life, Maskull?"

Gangnet's face was transfigured with an extraordinary spiritual beauty;
he looked as if he had descended from heaven.

"I understand nothing, except that I have no self any more. But this is
life."

"Is Gangnet expatiating on his famous blue sun?" said a jeering voice
above them. Looking up, they saw that Krag had got to his feet.

They both rose. At the same moment the gathering mist began to obscure
Alppain's disk, changing it from blue to a vivid jale.

"What do you want with us, Krag?" asked Maskull with simple composure.

Krag looked at him strangely for a few seconds. The water lapped around
them.

"Don't you comprehend, Maskull, that your death has arrived?"

Maskull made no response. Krag rested an arm lightly on his shoulder,
and suddenly he felt sick and faint. He sank to the ground, near the
edge of the island raft. His heart was thumping heavily and queerly;
its beating reminded him of the drum taps. He gazed languidly at the
rippling water, and it seemed to him as if he could see right through
it... away, away down... to a strange fire....

The water disappeared. The two suns were extinguished. The island was
transformed into a cloud, and Maskull--alone on it--was floating through
the atmosphere.... Down below, it was all fire--the fire of Muspel. The
light mounted higher and higher, until it filled the whole world....

He floated toward an immense perpendicular cliff of black rock, without
top or bottom. Halfway up it Krag, suspended in midair, was dealing
terrific blows at a blood-red spot with a huge hammer. The rhythmical,
clanging sounds were hideous.

Presently Maskull made out that these sounds were the familiar drum
beats. "What are you doing, Krag?" he asked.

Krag suspended his work, and turned around.

"Beating on Your heart, Maskull," was his grinning response.

The cliff and Krag vanished. Maskull saw Gangnet struggling in the
air--but it was not Gangnet--it was Crystalman. He seemed to be trying
to escape from the Muspel-fire, which kept surrounding and licking him,
whichever way he turned. He was screaming.... The fire caught him. He
shrieked horribly. Maskull caught one glimpse of a vulgar, slobbering
face--and then that too disappeared.

He opened his eyes. The floating island was still faintly illuminated by
Alppain. Krag was standing by his side, but Gangnet was no longer there.

"What is this Ocean called?" asked Maskull, bringing out the words with
difficulty.

"Surtur's Ocean."

Maskull nodded, and kept quiet for some time. He rested his face on his
arm. "Where's Nightspore?" he asked suddenly.

Krag bent over him with a grave expression. "You are Nightspore."

The dying man closed his eyes, and smiled.

Opening them again, a few moments later, with an effort, he murmured,
"Who are you?"

Krag maintained a gloomy silence.

Shortly afterward a frightful pang passed through Maskull's heart, and
he died immediately.

Krag turned his head around. "The night is really past at last,
Nightspore.... The day is here."

Nightspore gazed long and earnestly at Maskull's body. "Why was all this
necessary?"

"Ask Crystalman," replied Krag sternly. "His world is no joke. He has a
strong clutch--but I have a stronger... Maskull was his, but Nightspore
is mine."



Chapter 21. MUSPEL

The fog thickened so that the two suns wholly disappeared, and all grew
as black as night. Nightspore could no longer see his companion. The
water lapped gently against the side of the island raft.

"You say the night is past," said Nightspore. "But the night is still
here. Am I dead, or alive?"

"You are still in Crystalman's world, but you belong to it no more. We
are approaching Muspel."

Nightspore felt a strong, silent throbbing of the air--a rhythmical
pulsation, in four-four time. "There is the drumming," he exclaimed.

"Do you understand it, or have you forgotten?"

"I half understand it, but I'm all confused."

"It's evident Crystalman has dug his claws into you pretty deeply,"
said Krag. "The sound comes from Muspel, but the rhythm is caused by its
travelling through Crystalman's atmosphere. His nature is rhythm as he
loves to call it--or dull, deadly repetition, as I name it."

"I remember," said Nightspore, biting his nails in the dark.

The throbbing became audible; it now sounded like a distant drum. A
small patch of strange light in the far distance, straight ahead of
them, began faintly to illuminate the floating island and the glassy sea
around it.

"Do all men escape from that ghastly world, or only I, and a few like
me?" asked Nightspore.

"If all escaped, I shouldn't sweat, my friend... There's hard work, and
anguish, and the risk of total death, waiting for us yonder."

Nightspore's heart sank. "Have I not yet finished, then?"

"If you wish it. You have got through. But will you wish it?"

The drumming grew loud and painful. The light resolved itself into a
tiny oblong of mysterious brightness in a huge wall of night. Krag's
grim and rocklike features were revealed.

"I can't face rebirth," said Nightspore. "The horror of death is nothing
to it."

"You will choose."

"I can do nothing. Crystalman is too powerful. I barely escaped with--my
own soul."

"You are still stupid with Earth fumes, and see nothing straight," said
Krag.

Nightspore made no reply, but seemed to be trying to recall something.
The water around them was so still, colourless, and transparent, that
they scarcely seemed to be borne up by liquid matter at all. Maskull's
corpse had disappeared.

The drumming was now like the clanging of iron. The oblong patch of
light grew much bigger; it burned, fierce and wild. The darkness
above, below, and on either side of it, began to shape itself into the
semblance of a huge, black wall, without bounds.

"Is that really a wall we are coming to?"

"You will soon find out. What you see is Muspel, and that light is the
gate you have to enter."

Nightspore's heart beat wildly.

"Shall I remember?" he muttered.

"Yes, you'll remember."

"Accompany me, Krag, or I shall be lost."

"There is nothing for me to do in there. I shall wait outside for you."

"You are returning to the struggle?" demanded Nightspore, gnawing his
fingertips.

"Yes."

"I dare not."

The thunderous clangor of the rhythmical beats struck on his head like
actual blows. The light glared so vividly that he was no longer able to
look at it. It had the startling irregularity of continuous lightning,
but it possessed this further peculiarity--that it seemed somehow to
give out not actual light, but emotion, seen as light. They continued to
approach the wall of darkness, straight toward the door. The glasslike
water flowed right against it, its surface reaching up almost to the
threshold.

They could not speak any more; the noise was too deafening.

In a few minutes they were before the gateway. Nightspore turned his
back and hid his eyes in his two hands, but even then he was blinded
by the light. So passionate were his feelings that his body seemed to
enlarge itself. At every frightful beat of sound, he quivered violently.

The entrance was doorless. Krag jumped onto the rocky platform and
pulled Nightspore after him.

Once through the gateway, the light vanished. The rhythmical
sound--blows totally ceased. Nightspore dropped his hands.... All was
dark and quiet as an opened tomb. But the air was filled with grim,
burning passion, which was to light and sound what light itself is to
opaque colour.

Nightspore pressed his hand to his heart. "I don't know if I can endure
it," he said, looking toward Krag. He felt his person far more vividly
and distinctly than if he had been able to see him.

"Go in, and lose no time, Nightspore.... Time here is more precious than
on earth. We can't squander the minutes. There are terrible and tragic
affairs to attend to, which won't wait for us... Go in at once. Stop for
nothing."

"Where shall I go to?" muttered Nightspore. "I have forgotten
everything."

"Enter, enter! There is only one way. You can't mistake it."

"Why do you bid me go in, if I am to come out again?"

"To have your wounds healed."

Almost before the words had left his mouth, Krag sprang back on to the
island raft. Nightspore involuntarily started after him, but at
once recovered himself and remained standing where he was. Krag was
completely invisible; everything outside was black night.

The moment he had gone, a feeling shot up in Nightspore's heart like a
thousand trumpets.

Straight in front of him, almost at his feet, was the lower end of a
steep, narrow, circular flight of stone steps. There was no other way
forward.

He put his foot on the bottom stair, at the same time peering aloft.
He saw nothing, yet as he proceeded upward every inch of the way was
perceptible to his inner feelings. The staircase was cold, dismal, and
deserted, but it seemed to him, in his exaltation of soul, like a ladder
to heaven.

After he had mounted a dozen steps or so, he paused to take breath. Each
step was increasingly difficult to ascend; he felt as though he were
carrying a heavy man on his shoulders. It struck a familiar chord in his
mind. He went on and, ten stairs higher up, came to a window set in a
high embrasure.

On to this he clambered, and looked through. The window was of a sort of
glass, but he could see nothing. Coming to him, however, from the world
outside, a disturbance of the atmosphere struck his senses, causing his
blood to run cold. At one moment it resembled a low, mocking, vulgar
laugh, travelling from the ends of the earth; at the next it was like
a rhythmical vibration of the air--the silent, continuous throbbing of
some mighty engine. The two sensations were identical, yet different.
They seemed to be related in the same manner as soul and body. After
feeling them for a long time, Nightspore got down from the embrasure,
and continued his ascent, having meanwhile grown very serious.

The climbing became still more laborious, and he was forced to stop at
every third or fourth step, to rest his muscles and regain breath. When
he had mounted another twenty stairs in this way, he came to a second
window. Again he saw nothing. The laughing disturbance of the air,
too, had ceased; but the atmospheric throb was now twice as distinct
as before, and its rhythm had become double. There were two separate
pulses; one was in the time of a march, the other in the time of a
waltz. The first was bitter and petrifying to feel, but the second was
gay, enervating, and horrible.

Nightspore spent little time at that window, for he felt that he was
on the eve of a great discovery, and that something far more important
awaited him higher up. He proceeded aloft. The ascent grew more and
more exhausting, so much so that he had frequently to sit down, utterly
crushed by his own dead weight. Still, he got to the third window.

He climbed into the embrasure. His feelings translated themselves into
vision, and he saw a sight that caused him to turn pale. A gigantic,
self-luminous sphere was hanging in the sky, occupying nearly the whole
of it. This sphere was composed entirely of two kinds of active beings.
There were a myriad of tiny green corpuscles, varying in size from the
very small to the almost indiscernible. They were not green, but he
somehow saw them so. They were all striving in one direction--toward
himself, toward Muspel, but were too feeble and miniature to make any
headway. Their action produced the marching rhythm he had previously
felt, but this rhythm was not intrinsic in the corpuscles themselves,
but was a consequence of the obstruction they met with. And, surrounding
these atoms of life and light, were far larger whirls of white light
that gyrated hither and thither, carrying the green corpuscles with
them wherever they desired. Their whirling motion was accompanied by the
waltzing rhythm. It seemed to Nightspore that the green atoms were
not only being danced about against their will but were suffering
excruciating shame and degradation in consequence. The larger ones were
steadier than the extremely small, a few were even almost stationary,
and one was advancing in the direction it wished to go.

He turned his back to the window, buried his face in his hands, and
searched in the dim recesses of his memory for an explanation of what he
had just seen. Nothing came straight, but horror and wrath began to take
possession of him.

On his way upward to the next window, invisible fingers seemed to him
to be squeezing his heart and twisting it about here and there; but he
never dreamed of turning back. His mood was so grim that he did not once
permit himself to pause. Such was his physical distress by the time that
he had clambered into the recess, that for several minutes he could see
nothing at all--the world seemed to be spinning round him rapidly.

When at last he looked, he saw the same sphere as before, but now all
was changed on it. It was a world of rocks, minerals, water, plants,
animals, and men. He saw the whole world at one view, yet everything was
so magnified that he could distinguish the smallest details of life. In
the interior of every individual, of every aggregate of individuals,
of every chemical atom, he clearly perceived the presence of the green
corpuscles. But, according to the degree of dignity of the life form,
they were fragmentary or comparatively large. In the crystal, for
example, the green, imprisoned life was so minute as to be scarcely
visible; in some men it was hardly bigger; but in other men and women it
was twenty or a hundred times greater. But, great or small, it played
an important part in every individual. It appeared as if the whirls of
white light, which were the individuals, and plainly showed themselves
beneath the enveloping bodies, were delighted with existence and wished
only to enjoy it, but the green corpuscles were in a condition of
eternal discontent, yet, blind and not knowing which way to turn for
liberation, kept changing form, as though breaking a new path, by way of
experiment. Whenever the old grotesque became metamorphosed into the
new grotesque, it was in every case the direct work of the green atoms,
trying to escape toward Muspel, but encountering immediate opposition.
These subdivided sparks of living, fiery spirit were hopelessly
imprisoned in a ghastly mush of soft pleasure. They were being
effeminated and corrupted--that is to say, absorbed in the foul, sickly
enveloping forms.

Nightspore felt a sickening shame in his soul as he looked on at that
spectacle. His exaltation had long since vanished. He bit his nails, and
understood why Krag was waiting for him below.

He mounted slowly to the fifth window. The pressure of air against him
was as strong as a full gale, divested of violence and irregularity,
so that he was not for an instant suffered to relax his efforts.
Nevertheless, not a breath stirred.

Looking through the window, he was startled by a new sight. The sphere
was still there, but between it and the Muspel-world in which he was
standing he perceived a dim, vast shadow, without any distinguishable
shape, but somehow throwing out a scent of disgusting sweetness.
Nightspore knew that it was Crystalman. A flood of fierce light--but it
was not light, but passion--was streaming all the time from Muspel to
the Shadow, and through it. When, however, it emerged on the other side,
which was the sphere, the light was altered in character. It became
split, as by a prism, into the two forms of life which he had previously
seen--the green corpuscles and the whirls. What had been fiery spirit
but a moment ago was now a disgusting mass of crawling, wriggling
individuals, each whirl of pleasure-seeking will having, as nucleus, a
fragmentary spark of living green fire. Nightspore recollected the back
rays of Starkness, and it flashed across him with the certainty of truth
that the green sparks were the back rays, and the whirls the forward
rays, of Muspel. The former were trying desperately to return to their
place of origin, but were overpowered by the brute force of the latter,
which wished only to remain where they were. The individual whirls were
jostling and fighting with, and even devouring, each other. This created
pain, but, whatever pain they felt, it was always pleasure that they
sought. Sometimes the green sparks were strong enough for a moment to
move a little way in the direction of Muspel; the whirls would then
accept the movement, not only without demur, but with pride and
pleasure, as if it were their own handiwork--but they never saw beyond
the Shadow, they thought that they were travelling toward it. The
instant the direct movement wearied them, as contrary to their whirling
nature, they fell again to killing, dancing, and loving.

Nightspore had a foreknowledge that the sixth window would prove to
be the last. Nothing would have kept him from ascending to it, for
he guessed that the nature of Crystalman himself would there become
manifest. Every step upward was like a bloody life-and-death struggle.
The stairs nailed him to the ground; the air pressure caused blood to
gush from his nose and ears; his head clanged like an iron bell. When
he had fought his way up a dozen steps, he found himself suddenly at the
top; the staircase terminated in a small, bare chamber of cold stone,
possessing a single window. On the other side of the apartment another
short flight of stairs mounted through a trap, apparently to the roof of
the building. Before ascending these stairs, Nightspore hastened to the
window and stared out.

The shadow form of Crystalman had drawn much closer to him, and filled
the whole sky, but it was not a shadow of darkness, but a bright shadow.
It had neither shape, nor colour, yet it in some way suggested the
delicate tints of early morning. It was so nebulous that the sphere
could be clearly distinguished through it; in extension, however, it
was thick. The sweet smell emanating from it was strong, loathsome,
and terrible; it seemed to spring from a sort of loose, mocking slime
inexpressibly vulgar and ignorant.

The spirit stream from Muspel flashed with complexity and variety. It
was not below individuality, but above it. It was not the One, or the
Many, but something else far beyond either. It approached Crystalman,
and entered his body--if that bright mist could be called a body. It
passed right through him, and the passage caused him the most exquisite
pleasure. The Muspel-stream was Crystalman's food. The stream emerged
from the other side on to the sphere, in a double condition. Part of
it reappeared intrinsically unaltered, but shivered into a million
fragments. These were the green corpuscles. In passing through
Crystalman they had escaped absorption by reason of their extreme
minuteness. The other part of the stream had not escaped. Its fire had
been abstracted, its cement was withdrawn, and, after being fouled
and softened by the horrible sweetness of the host, it broke into
individuals, which were the whirls of living will.

Nightspore shuddered. He comprehended at last how the whole world of
will was doomed to eternal anguish in order that one Being might feel
joy.

Presently he set foot on the final flight leading to the roof; for he
remembered vaguely that now only that remained.

Halfway up, he fainted--but when he recovered consciousness he persisted
as though nothing had happened to him. As soon as his head was above the
trap, breathing the free air, he had the same physical sensation as a
man stepping out of water. He pulled his body up, and stood expectantly
on the stone-floored roof, looking round for his first glimpse of
Muspel.
