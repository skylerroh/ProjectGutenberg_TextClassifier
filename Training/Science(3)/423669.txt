suddenly had peace thrust upon it. You'd have a depression such as
you've never dreamed of. Let's face reality, Jim, neither of us can
afford peace."

"Well, we've both known that for a long time."

They both considered somberly, the planet Earth blazing away, a small
sun there in the sky.

Jim said, "I sometimes think that the race would have been better off,
when man was colonizing Venus and Mars, if it had been a joint
enterprise rather than you people doing one, and we the other. If it had
all been in the hands of that organization ..."

"The United Nations?" Vovo supplied.

"... Then when Bomb Day hit, perhaps these new worlds could have gone on
to, well, better things."

"Perhaps," Vovo shrugged. "I've often wondered how Bomb Day started. Who
struck the spark."

"Happily there were enough colonists on both planets to start the race
all over again," Jim said. "What difference does it make, who struck the
spark?"

"None, I suppose." Vovo began to button his collar, readjust his
clothes. "Well, shall we emerge and let the quaking multitudes know that
once again we have made a shaky agreement? One that will last until the
next summit meeting."


THE END.

Transcriber's Note

In two places in the text the word "reforestration" was corrected to
"reforestation."
