Transcriber's note: A word surrounded by underscores like _this_
signifies the word is italics in the text. A word surrounded by cedillas
like ~this~, signifies the word is bolded in the text. For numbers and
equations, underscores before bracketed numbers in equations denote a
subscript.


PREFACE


These few pages are intended to serve a twofold purpose,--to give the
student a general outline of Blowpipe Analysis, and to introduce him to
the methods of Determinative Mineralogy.

Every effort has been made to simplify details so that the book may be
used in both High Schools and Colleges.

Tables for "systematic" examination have been intentionally omitted, for
in the author's estimation these tend to dull the student's power of
observation, and to make him place little value upon minute details.

The alphabetic arrangement has been followed for the sake of convenience
when referring to the book.

The last chapter is not intended to serve as a key to determining the
minerals therein described, but rather it is added to give the student
exercise in Blowpipe Analysis, and at the same time to point out the
_methods_ of Determinative Mineralogy.

Finally, the author would acknowledge his indebtedness to the following
works: "Manual of Qualitative Analysis," Fresenius; "Qualitative
Chemical Analysis," Venable; Roscoe and Schorlemmer's "Treatise on
Chemistry"; Foye's "Hand-Book of Mineralogy"; Dana's "Mineralogy";
Kobell's "Tafeln zur Bestimmung der Mineralien"; etc.
