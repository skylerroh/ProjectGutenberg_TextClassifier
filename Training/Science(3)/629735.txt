No need to hurry. For a moment he wanted to watch Curtis. He wondered
what kind of pictures Clyde was seeing on the blank wall. Martian
landscapes? The strange Ladonai? Too bad he hadn't stayed on Mars. Stern
couldn't help having a friendly feeling for his old college chum, pity,
too, for what must happen to him soon.

This was no way to kill anyone!

He was growing old and soft!

Nevertheless, Curtis _did_ have a noble and striking face. Funny he had
never noticed it before. It seemed to glow with an uncanny peace.

Unnoticed, the numbness crept from Stern's palm along his right arm, and
a prickly sensation appeared in his right leg.

It was funny to read a person's thoughts like this. Love flowed from
Curtis like the warm glow from a burning candle. A sort of halo had
formed from the light above his head.

Symbolic.

From Curtis came wave after wave of love. He could feel it pulsating
toward him, and he felt his own heart turn over, answer it. Yes, Curtis
was noble.

Stern sank cross-legged on the floor beside Curtis and gazed at him. The
prickly sensation had ascended from his leg up through his chest and to
his neck. But it didn't matter. Now, for a last time, he could feel the
spell of that perfect friendship--before the end.

What end? Why should there be any end to this eternal moment?

Curtis noticed him now. Those half-closed eyes were strangely
penetrating. They looked him through.

"Well, Al," he said, "so you killed Schaughtowl?"

Stern looked at the kindly, godlike face and loved it.

Killed whom?

"Poor Al," Curtis said. He leaned over and laid his hand on the back of
Stern's neck, fondling it much as one would a dog. "Poor old Al."

Stern's heart leaped in joy. This was ecstasy. It must be expressed. It
demanded expression. If he had possessed a tail, he would have wagged
it. Perhaps there was a word for that bliss. There was, and with immense
satisfaction he spoke it.

"Gull Lup," he said.
