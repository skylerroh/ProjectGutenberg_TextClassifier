pain, he felt himself falling through bottomless spaces....

So exhausted that he could scarcely move, Phobar blinked his eyes open
to brilliant daylight in the chill of a November Indian summer noon. The
sun shone radiant in the heavens; off in the distance he heard a
pandemonium of bells and whistles. Wearily he noticed that there were no
flame-paths in the sky.

Staggering weakly, he made his way to the observatory, mounted the steps
with tired limbs, and wobbled to the eyepiece of his telescope which he
had left focused on the dark star two hours before. Almost trembling, he
peered through it.

The dark star was gone. Somewhere far out in the abysses of the
universe, a runaway world plunged headlong at ever-mounting speed to
uncharted regions under its double acceleration of attraction and
repulsion.

A sigh of contentment came from his lips as he sank into a heavy and
profound sleep. Later he would learn of the readjustments in the solar
system, and of the colder climate that came to Earth, and of the vast
changes permanently made by the invading planet, and of a blazing new
star discovered in Orion that might signify the birth of a sun or the
death of a metallic dark world.

But these were events to be, and he demanded his immediate reward of a
day's dreamless slumber.
