COTTON MILLS AND MACHINE SHOPS

Can make great savings by using the Allen Governor. Its operation is
unequalled and wonderful. Nearly all machinists once using these
Governors become agents for their sale. They are simple in construction,
not liable to get out of order, permit the speed of the engine to be
changed at will, are neat in appearance, noiseless, very durable, save
the engineer's time, save fuel, and are at once the most powerful and
most sensitive Governors ever made.

Russell (Cotton) Mills, Plymouth, Mass., March 20, 1876.

S. B. ALLEN: Your Governor has been attached to our Corliss engine over
one year, and has given perfect satisfaction. The engine was never
governed until yours was attached, although we have tried three of the
best kind of Governors known. When steam or work varied, the speed
would vary, and we could only run our looms an average of 103 picks per
minute. Since using your Governor, and solely on account of the perfect
steadiness with which it holds the engine and machinery, we are enabled
to run the looms regularly 112 picks per minute, MAKING AN ACTUAL
INCREASE OF OUR ENTIRE PRODUCTION OF OVER EIGHT PER CENT. Your Governor
saves coal, saves waste, saves care and labor of the engineer, and
produces more goods and better goods. I have timed the engine a hundred
times, and never found it to vary in the least. It is the honest truth
that the Allen Governor holds it exactly on speed.

PATENTS

CAVEATS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE MARKS, ETC.

Messrs. Munn & Co., in connection with the publication of the
SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, continue to examine Improvements, and to act as
Solicitors of Patents for Inventors.

In this line of business they have had OVER THIRTY YEARS' EXPERIENCE,
and now have _unequaled facilities_ for the preparation of Patent
Drawings, Specifications, and the Prosecution of Applications for
Patents in the United States, Canada, and Foreign Countries. Messrs.
Munn & Co. also attend to the preparation of Caveats, Trade Mark
Regulations, Copyrights for Books, Labels, Reissues, Assignments, and
Reports on Infringements of Patents. All business intrusted to them is
done with special care and promptness, on very moderate terms.

We send free of charge, on application, THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN HAND
BOOK, an elegantly illustrated pamphlet of 48 pages, containing
further information about Patents and how to procure them; directions
concerning Trade Marks, Copyrights, Designs, Patents, Appeals, Reissues,
Infringements, Assignments, Rejected Cases, Hints on the Sale of
Patents.

_Foreign Patents._--We also send, _free of charge,_ a Synopsis of
Foreign Patent Laws, showing the cost and method of securing patents
in all the principal countries of the world. American inventors should
bear in mind that, as a general rule, any invention that is valuable
to the patentee in this country is worth equally as much in England
and some other foreign countries.

Five patents--embracing Canadian, English, German, French, and Belgian
--will secure to an inventor the exclusive monopoly to his discovery
among about ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLIONS of the most intelligent
people in the world. The facilities of business and steam
communication are such that patents can be obtained abroad by our
citizens almost as easily as at home. The expense to apply for an
English patent is $75; German, $100; French, $100; Belgian, $100;
Canadian, $50. Address
