On examining this table it may be observed that, notwithstanding the
very great variety in the proportion of ash in different plants, some
general relations may be traced. A certain similarity may be observed
between those belonging to the same natural family, the seeds of all the
cereal grains, for instance, containing in round numbers two per cent of
inorganic matters. Leguminous seeds (peas and beans) contain about three
per cent, while in rape-seed, linseed, and the other oily seeds, it
reaches four per cent. In the stems and straws less uniformity exists,
but with the exception of a few extreme cases, the quantity of ash in
general approaches pretty closely to five per cent. Still more
diversified results are obtained from the entire plants; but this
diversity is probably much more apparent than real, and must be, in part
at least, dependent on the proportion existing between the stem and
leaves, for the leaves are peculiarly rich in ash, and a leafy plant
must necessarily yield a higher total percentage of ash, although, if
stems and leaves were separately examined, they might not show so
conspicuous a difference.

The leaves surpass all other parts of plants, in the proportion of
inorganic constituents they contain, the table showing that in some
instances, as in the maple and Jerusalem artichoke, they exceed
one-fourth of the whole weight of the dry matter. In other leaves, and
more especially in those of the coniferae, the proportion is much
smaller. Taking the average of all the analyses hitherto made, it
appears that leaves contain about thirteen per cent of ash, but the
variations on either side are so large that little value is to be
attached to it except as an indication of the general abundance of
mineral matters.

In roots and tubers the variations are less, and all, except the potato
and the turnip, contain about seven per cent of ash.

The smallest proportion of mineral matter is found in wood. In one case
only does the proportion reach five per cent, while the average scarcely
exceeds one, and in the fir the quantity amounts to no more than one
six-hundredth of the dry matter. In the bark the quantity is much
larger, and may be stated at seven per cent.

The general proportion of ash found in different parts of plants is
given in round numbers in the subjoined table:--

Wood                1
Seeds               3
Stems and straws    5
Roots and tubers    7
Bark                7
Leaves             13

The differences in the quantity of ash contained in different parts of
plants are obviously intended to serve a useful purpose, and it is
interesting to observe that the wood which is destined to remain for a
long period, sometimes for several centuries, a part of the plant,
contains the smallest proportion, and it is not improbable that what it
does contain is really due, not to the actual woody matter itself, but
to the sap which permeates its vessels. By this arrangement but a small
proportion of these important mineral matters, which the soil supplies
in very limited quantity, is locked up within the plant, and those which
are absorbed, after circulating through it, and fulfilling their
allotted functions, are accumulated in the leaves, and annually returned
to the soil.

The different proportions of mineral matters contained in the individual
organs of plants is most strikingly illustrated when parallel
experiments are made on the same species; but the number of instances in
which a sufficiently extensive series of analyses has been made to show
this, is comparatively limited, and is confined to the oat, the
orange-tree, and the horse chesnut--each of which has formed the subject
of a very elaborate investigation. The following table gives the results
obtained on the oat:--

The specimens of oats on which these analyses were made were from
different districts of country, grown on soils of different quality, and
were, further, of different varieties; and yet they show, on the whole,
a remarkable similarity in the proportion of ash in each part, and
indicate that there is a normal quantity belonging to it. Such a series
of analyses also affords the most convincing proof that the inorganic
matters cannot be fortuitous, and merely absorbed from the soil along
with their organic food, as the old chemists supposed, because, in that
case, they ought to be uniformly distributed throughout the entire
plant, and not accumulated in particular proportions in each individual
organ.

Not only does the proportion of ash vary in the different parts of a
plant, but even in the same part it is greatly influenced by its period
of growth. The laws which regulate these variations are very imperfectly
known, but in general it is observed that during the period of active
growth the quantity of ash is largest. Thus, it has been found that in
early spring the wood of the young shoots of the horse-chesnut contains
9.9 per cent of ash. In autumn this has diminished to 3.4, and the last
year's twigs contain only 1.1 per cent, while in the old wood the
quantity does not exceed 0.5. Saussure has also observed that the
quantity of ash diminishes in certain plants when the seed has ripened.
Thus, he found that the percentages of ash, before flowering, and after
seeding, were as follows:--

               Before flowering.  With ripe seed.
Sunflower             14.7             9.3
Wheat                  7.9             3.3
Maize                 12.2             4.6

On the other hand, the quantity of ash in the leaves of trees increases
considerably in autumn, as shown by this table:--

                          PER-CENTAGE OF ASH IN
                          May.        September.
Oak leaves                5.3         5.5
Poplar                    6.6         9.3
Hazel                     6.1         7.0
Horse-chesnut             7.2         8.6

In general, the proportion of ash appears to increase as the plant
reaches maturity, and this is particularly seen in the oat, of which
very complete analyses have been made at different periods of its
growth:--

The increase is here principally confined to the leaves and chaff, while
the stalks, which owe their strength to a considerable extent to the
inorganic matters they contain, are equally supplied at all periods of
their growth. In the grain only is there a diminution, but this is
apparent and not real, and is due to the fact that the determination of
the quantity of ash, as made on the grain with its husk, and the former,
which contains only a small quantity of mineral matters, increases much
more rapidly in weight than the latter, when it approaches the period of
ripening, and it is accordingly during the last three weeks of its
growth that this diminution becomes apparent.

The nature of the soil has also a very important influence on the
proportion of mineral matters, and of this an interesting illustration
is given in the following table, which shows the quantities found in the
grain and straw of the same variety of the pea grown on fourteen
different soils:--

+----+-------+--------+

+----+-------+--------+
|  1 |  2.30 |        |

Although those differences are very large, especially in the straw, and
must be attributed to the soil, it has hitherto been found impossible to
ascertain the nature of the relation subsisting between it and the crops
it yields; indeed, it must obviously be dependent on very complicated
questions, which cannot at present be solved, for it may be observed
that the increase in the grain does not occur simultaneously with that
in the straw, and in several cases a large proportion of ash in the
former is associated with an unusually small amount in the latter. _A
priori_, it might be expected that those soils which are especially rich
in the more important constituents of the ash should yield a produce
containing more than the average quantity, but this is very far from
being an invariable occurrence, and not unfrequently the very reverse
is the case. In some instances the variations may be traced to the soil,
as in the following analyses of the fruit of the horse-chesnut, grown on
an ordinary forest soil, and on a rich soil, produced by the
disintegration of porphyritic rock, in which the latter yields a much
larger quantity of ash:--

                  Kernel of seed.  Green husk.   Brown husk.
Forest soil        2.26             4.53          1.70
Porphyry soil      3.36             7.29          2.20

In the majority of instances we fail to establish any connection between
the nature of the soil and the plants it yields, chiefly because we are
still very deficient in analyses of those grown on uncultivated soils;
and on cultivated land it is impossible to draw conclusions, because the
nature of the manure exerts an influence quite as great, if not greater,
than that of the soil itself.

The relative proportion in which the different mineral matters enter
into the composition of the ash varies within very wide limits, as will
be apparent from the following table, containing a selection of the best
analyses of our common cultivated and a few uncultivated plants.

columns have not been introduced for them, but their quantity is stated
