Donnelly sat, suddenly transfixed, staring at his typewriter. A peculiar
look flashed across his face. Then he shook his massive head in an
unbelieving gesture of agonized understanding.

"Hell, no," he muttered to himself. "It couldn't be. It just couldn't
be. It just isn't possible. Burnett! _Burnett!_"

Swiftly he was on his feet and moving through the door after the
vanished figure of the little doctor, his face a mask of grim remorse.

"It was merciful," he muttered. "Yes, it _was_ merciful. It was the only
thing Doc Burnett could have done."

Williams stared after Donnelly's disappearing figure in frank and
open-mouthed amazement.

"Hey, Joe," he yelled. "Where the hell are you going?"

The outer door slammed shut on the departing echo of his words. "Well,
I'll be hung for an ugly son!" he muttered to himself. "Nobody makes
sense around this place, any more."

He shrugged half to himself and then began to type out the rest of the
report.

"I don't get it," he mumbled to himself. "I just don't get it at all.
There's no logic in it."




Transcriber's Note:

    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ September 1955.
    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.
    copyright on this publication was renewed. Minor spelling and
    typographical errors have been corrected without note. Although
    _polaroid_ appears as originally printed, given the lack of a
    capital letter, it may be a printer's error for _polarized_.
