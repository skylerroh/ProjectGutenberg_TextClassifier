
Besides, already Joe was beginning to feel the comfortable, pleasurable,
warm feeling that came to him on occasions like this.

He said, "You're sure this guy talks American, eh?"

Warren Brett-James said, "Quite sure. He is a student of history."

"And he won't think it's funny I talk American to him, eh?"

"He'll undoubtedly be intrigued."

They pulled up before a large apartment building that overlooked the
area once known as Wilmington.

Joe was coolly efficient now. He pulled out the automatic, held it down
below his knees and threw a shell into the barrel. He eased the hammer
down, thumbed on the safety, stuck the weapon back in his belt and
beneath the jacketlike garment he wore.

He said, "O.K. See you guys later." He left them and entered the
building.

An elevator--he still wasn't used to their speed in this era--whooshed
him to the penthouse duplex occupied by Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy.

There were two persons in the reception room but they left on Joe's
arrival, without bothering to look at him more than glancingly.

He spotted the screen immediately and went over and stood before it.

The screen lit and revealed a heavy-set, dour of countenance man seated
at a desk. He looked into Joe Prantera's face, scowled and said
something.

Joe said, "Joseph Salviati-Prantera to interview Citizen Howard
Temple-Tracy."

The other's shaggy eyebrows rose. "Indeed," he said. "In Amer-English?"

Joe nodded.

"Enter," the other said.

A door had slid open on the other side of the room. Joe walked through
it and into what was obviously an office. Citizen Temple-Tracy sat at a
desk. There was only one other chair in the room. Joe Prantera ignored
it and remained standing.

Citizen Temple-Tracy said, "What can I do for you?"

Joe looked at him for a long, long moment. Then he reached down to his
belt and brought forth the .45 automatic. He moistened his lips.

Joe said softly, "You know what this here is?"

Temple-Tracy stared at the weapon. "It's a handgun, circa, I would say,
about 1925 Old Calendar. What in the world are you doing with it?"

Joe said, very slowly, "Chief, in the line you're in these days you
needa heavy around with wunna these. Otherwise, Chief, you're gunna wind
up in some gutter with a lotta holes in you. What I'm doin', I'm askin'
for a job. You need a good man knows how to handle wunna these, Chief."

Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy eyed him appraisingly. "Perhaps," he said,
"you are right at that. In the near future, I may well need an assistant
knowledgeable in the field of violence. Tell me more about yourself. You
surprise me considerably."

"Sure, Chief. It's kinda a long story, though. First off, I better tell
you you got some bad enemies, Chief. Two guys special, named Brett-James
and Doc Reston-Farrell. I think one of the first jobs I'm gunna hafta do
for you, Chief, is to give it to those two."
