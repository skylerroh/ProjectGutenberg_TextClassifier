
"My wife!" he cried. "My wife! I'll ..."

A sudden sobering thought struck him. He was talking too much. And he
wasn't making sense. He shouldn't be telling her this. Anyway, he
couldn't get the money tonight even if he did kill his wife.

"And so you are going to kill your wife...."

He blinked the tears from his eyes. His chest was heaving, his heart
pounding. He looked at her shimmering form. "Y-yes," he whispered.

Her eyes glinted strangely in the light of the moon. Her handbag glinted
as she opened it, and something she took from it glittered coldly in
her hand.

"Fool!"

The first shot tore squarely through his heart. And while he stood
staring at her, mouth agape, a second shot burned its way through his
bewildered brain.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mrs. Herbert Hyrel removed the telovis from her head and laid it
carefully aside. She uncoiled her long legs from beneath her, walked to
her husband's chair, and stood for a long moment looking down at him,
her lips drawn back in contempt. Then she bent over him and reached down
his thigh until her fingers contacted the small switch.

Seconds later, a slight tremor shook Hyrel's body. His eyes snapped
open, air escaped his lungs, his lower jaw sagged inanely, and his head
lolled to one side.

She stood a moment longer, watching his eyes become glazed and
sightless. Then she walked to the telephone.

"Police?" she said. "This is Mrs. Herbert Hyrel. Something horrible has
happened to my husband. Please come over immediately. Bring a doctor."

She hung up, went to her bathroom, stripped off her clothing, and slid
carefully out of her telporter suit. This she folded neatly and tucked
away into the false back of the medicine cabinet. She found a fresh pair
of blue, plastifur pajamas and got into them.

She was just arriving back into the living room, tying the cord of her
dressing gown about her slim waist, when she heard the sound of the
police siren out front.
