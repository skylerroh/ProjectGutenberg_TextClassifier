
Value for planting: Its rich and yellow color in the fall, and the fine
    spread of its crown make it a desirable tree for the lawn,
    especially in the country.

Commercial value: Its wood is hard and takes a good polish; used for
    interior finish and furniture. The tree is also the source of maple
    sugar. Fig. 27.

Other characters: The _bark_ is smooth in young trees and in old trees
    it shags in large plates. The _flowers_ appear in the early part of
    April.

Other common names: The sugar maple is sometimes called _rock maple_ or
    _hard maple_.


SILVER MAPLE (_Acer saccharinum_)

Distinguishing characters: The tips of the *twigs curve upwards* (Fig.
    28), the bark is scaly, and the leaves are very deeply cleft and are
    silvery on the under side.

[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Leaf of Sugar Maple.]

Leaf: Deeply cleft and silvery under side. Fig. 29.

Form and size: A large tree with the main branches separating from the
    trunk a few feet from the ground. The terminal twigs are long,
    slender, and drooping.

Range: Eastern United States.

Soil and location: Moist places.

Enemies: The _leopard moth_, a wood-boring insect, and the
    _cottony-maple scale_, a sucking insect.

[Illustration: FIG. 26.--The Sugar Maple.]

Value for planting: Grows too rapidly and is too short-lived to be
    durable.

Commercial value: Its wood is soft, weak, and little used.

Other characters: The _bark_ is light gray, smooth at first and scaly
    later on. The scales are free at each end and attached in the
    center. The _flowers_ appear before the leaves in the latter part of
    March or early April.

[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Tapping the Sugar Maple.]

Other common names: The silver maple is sometimes known as _soft maple_
    or _white maple_.


RED MAPLE (_Acer rubrum_)

[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Terminal Twig of Silver Maple.]

Distinguishing characters: The *bark is smooth and light gray*, like
    that of the beech, on the upper branches in older trees, and in
    young trees over the whole trunk. Fig. 30. The buds are in clusters,
    and the terminal twigs, Fig. 31, are quite red.

[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Leaf of the Silver Maple.]

Leaf: Whitish underneath with three-pointed lobes. Fig. 32.

Form and size: A medium-sized tree with a narrow, round head.

Range: Eastern North America.

Soil and location: Prefers moist places.

Enemies: Leaf blotches (_Rhytisma acerinum_) which, however, are not
    very injurious.

Value for planting: Suitable as a shade tree for suburban streets. Its
    rich red leaves in the fall make it attractive for the lawn.

[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Bark of the Red Maple.]

Commercial value: Its wood is heavy, close-grained, and takes a good
    polish. Used for furniture and fuel.

Other characters: The _bud_ is small, round, and red. The _flowers_
    appear before the leaves are out in the early part of April.

[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Twig of the Red Maple.]

[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Leaf of the Red Maple.]

Other common names: The red maple is sometimes known as _swamp maple_.

[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Twig of Norway Maple.]

Comparisons: The red maple is apt to be confused with the silver maple,
    but the latter can be distinguished by its turned-up twigs and scaly
    bark over the whole trunk of the tree, which presents a sharp
    contrast to the straight twig and smooth bark of the red maple. The
    latter has a bark similar to the beech, but its branches are
    _opposite_, while those of the beech are _alternate_.


NORWAY MAPLE (_Acer platanoides_)

Distinguishing characters: The bud, Fig. 33, is *oval and reddish-brown*
    in color; when taken off, a *milky juice exudes*. The bark is close.
    Fig. 34

[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Bark of Norway Maple.]

Leaf: Like the leaf of the sugar maple but thicker in texture and darker
    in color. Fig. 35.

Form and size: A tall tree with a broad, round head.

Range: Europe and the United States.

Soil and location: Will grow in poor soil.

Enemies: Very few.

Value for planting: One of the best shade trees.

Commercial value: None.

Other characters: The _bark_ is close like that of the mockernut
    hickory.

Comparisons: The Norway maple is apt to be confused with the _sycamore
    maple_ (_Acer pseudoplatanus_), but differs from the latter in
    having a reddish bud instead of a green bud, and a close bark
    instead of a scaly bark.


BOX ELDER (_Acer negundo_)

Distinguishing characters: The terminal *twigs are green*, and the buds
    are round and small. Fig. 36.

Leaf: Has three to seven leaflets.

[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Leaf of Norway Maple.]

Form and size: A medium-sized tree with a short trunk and wide-spreading
    top.

Range: Eastern United States to the Rocky Mountains.

Soil and location: Grows rapidly in deep, moist soil and river valleys,
    but accommodates itself to the dry and poor soil conditions of the
    city.

[Illustration: Figure 36.--Twig of the Box Elder.]

Enemies: Few.

Value for planting: Used as a shade tree in the Middle West, but the
    tree is so ill formed and so short-lived that it is not to be
    recommended.

Commercial value: None. The wood is soft.

Other characters: The _bark_ of the trunk is smooth and yellowish-green
    in young trees and grayish brown in older specimens. The _flowers_
    appear in the early part of April. The _fruit_ takes the form of
    yellowish-green keys which hang on the tree till late fall.

Other common names: The box elder is also commonly known as the
    _ash-leaf maple_.



GROUP VI. TREES TOLD BY THEIR FORM: ELM, POPLAR, GINGKO AND WILLOW

How to tell them from other trees: The trees described in this group are
    so distinctive in their general _form_ that they may, for the
    purpose of study, be grouped together, and distinguished from all
    other trees by this characteristic.

How to tell them from each other: The American elm is _vase-like_ in
    shape; the Lombardy poplar is narrow and _spire-like_; the gingko,
    or maidenhair tree, is _odd_ in its mode of _branching_; and the
    weeping willow is extremely _pendulous_.


AMERICAN ELM (_Ulmus americana_)

Distinguishing characters: The tree can be told at a glance by its
    general branching habit. The limbs arch out into a wide-spreading
    *fan or vase-like crown* which loses itself in numerous fine
    drooping branchlets. See Fig. 37.

[Illustration: FIG. 37.--American Elm.]

Leaf: The leaves are simple, alternate, and from 2 to 5 inches long.

[Illustration: FIG. 38.--English Elm in Winter.]

Form and size: It is a tall tree with a trunk that divides a short
    distance above ground. Its general contour, together with the
    numerous branches that interlace its massive crown, give the elm an
    interesting and stately appearance which is unequaled by any other
    tree.

[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Lombardy Poplar.]

Range: Eastern North America.

Soil and location: The elm prefers a deep, rich and moist soil, but will
    adapt itself even to the poor soil of the city street.

Enemies: _The leopard moth_, a wood-boring insect, and the _elm leaf
    beetle_, a leaf-eating insect, are the two most important enemies of
    the tree. Their ravages are very extensive.

Value for planting: The tree has a character of its own which cannot be
    duplicated for avenue or lawn planting.

Commercial value: The wood is strong and tough and therefore has a
    special value for cooperage, agricultural implements, carriages, and
    shipbuilding.

Other characters: The _buds_ are small, brown, and smooth, while those
    of the European elms are covered with down. The _small side twigs_
    come out at almost right angles to the larger terminal twigs, which
    is not the case in other species of elm.

[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Leaf of Carolina Poplar.]

Other common names: _White elm_.

Comparisons: The _English elm_ (_Ulmus campestris_) is also a tall,
    dignified tree commonly seen under cultivation in America, but may
    be told from the American species by the difference in their general
    contour. The branches of the English species spread out but do not
    arch like those of the American elm, and the bark of the English elm
    is darker and coarser, Fig. 38. Little tufts of dead twigs along the
    main branches and trunk of the tree are characteristic of the
    English elm and will frequently help to distinguish it from the
    American elm.

    The _Camperdown elm_ may be recognized readily by its dwarf size and
    its low drooping umbrella-shaped crown.


LOMBARDY OR ITALIAN POPLAR (_Populus nigra, var. italica_)

Distinguishing characters: Its *tall, slender, spire-like form* and
    rigidly *erect branches*, which commence low on the trunk, make this
    tree very distinct at all seasons of the year. See Fig. 39.

Leaf: Triangular in shape, similar to that of the Carolina poplar but
    smaller, see Fig. 40.

Range: Asia, Europe, and North America.

Soil and location: The poplar is easily grown in poor soil, in any
    location, and is very hardy.

Value for planting: The tree has a distinctive form which makes it
    valuable for special landscape effects. It is also used for shelter
    belts and screening. Like all poplars it is short lived and will
    stand pruning well.

Commercial value: None.

[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Carolina Poplar.]

Comparisons: The _Carolina poplar_, or Cottonwood (_Populus deltoides_)
    can be told from the Lombardy poplar by its wider crown and its more
    open branching, Fig. 41. It may be recognized by its big terminal
    twigs, which are light yellow in color and coarser than those of the
    Lombardy poplar, Fig. 42. Its bark is smooth, light and
    yellowish-green in young trees, and dark gray and fissured in older
    specimens. Its large, conical, glossy, chestnut-brown bud is also
    characteristic, Fig. 42. Its flowers, in the form of large catkins,
    a peculiarity of all poplars, appear in the early spring. The
    Carolina poplar is commonly planted in cities because it grows
    rapidly and is able to withstand the smoke and drouth conditions of
    the city. Where other trees, however, can be substituted with
    success, the poplar should be avoided. Its very fast growth is
    really a point against the tree, because it grows so fast that it
    becomes too tall for surrounding property, and its wood being
    extremely soft and brittle, the tree frequently breaks in
    windstorms. In many cases it is entirely uprooted, because it is not
    a deep-rooted tree. Its larger roots, which spread near the
    surface, upset the sidewalk or prevent the growth of other
    vegetation on the lawn, while its finer rootlets, in their eager
    search for moisture, penetrate and clog the joints of neighboring
    water and sewer pipes. The tree is commonly attacked by the
    _oyster-shell scale_, an insect which sucks the sap from its bark
    and which readily spreads to other more valuable trees like the elm.
    The female form of this tree is even more objectionable than the
    male, because in the early spring the former produces an abundance
    of cotton from its seeds which litters the ground and often makes
    walking dangerous. The only justification for planting the Carolina
    poplar is in places where the conditions for tree growth are so poor
    that nothing else will grow, and in those cases the tree should be
    cut back periodically in order to keep it from becoming too tall and
    scraggly. It is also desirable for screening in factory districts
    and similar situations.

[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Bud of the Carolina Poplar.]

    The _silver_ or _white poplar_ (_Populus alba_) may be told from the
    other poplars by its characteristic smooth, _whitish-green bark_,
    often spotted with dark blotches, Fig. 43. The _leaves are
    silvery-white_ and downy on the under side. The twigs are dark green
    in color and densely covered with a white down. It grows to very
    large size and forms an irregular, wide-spreading, broad head, which
    is characteristically different from that of any of the other
    poplars.

[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Bark of the Silver Poplar.]

    The _quaking aspen_ (_Populus tremuloides_), the _large-toothed
    aspen_ (_Populus grandidentata_) and the _balsam poplar_ or _balm of
    Gilead_ (_Populus balsamifera_) are other common members of the
    poplar group. The quaking aspen may be told by its reddish-brown
    twigs, narrow sharp-pointed buds, and by its small finely toothed
