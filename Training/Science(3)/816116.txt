    to become compact, where a tree is planted too deep, or where the
    roots are submerged under water for any length of time. In any case
    the air cannot get to the roots and the tree suffers. Nature takes
    special cognizance of this important requirement in the case of
    cypress trees, which habitually grow under water. Here the trees are
    provided with special woody protuberances known as "cypress knees,"
    which emerge above water and take the necessary air. See Fig. 18.

Conclusions: From the foregoing it will be seen that trees have certain
    needs that nature or man must supply. These requirements differ
    with the different species, and in all work of planting and care as
    well as in the natural distribution of trees it is both interesting
    and necessary to observe these individual wants, to select species
    in accordance with local conditions and to care for trees in
    conformity with their natural needs.




CHAPTER V

WHAT TREES TO PLANT AND HOW


The following classification will show the value of the more important
trees for different kinds of planting. The species are arranged in the
order of their merit for the particular object under consideration and
the comments accompanying each tree are intended to bring out its
special qualifications for that purpose.

Conditions for tree growth in one part of the country differ from those
of another and these lists, especially applicable to the Eastern States,
may not at all fit some other locality.



TREES BEST FOR THE LAWN


DECIDUOUS

1.  American elm (_Ulmus americana_)

    One of the noblest of trees. Possesses a majestic, wide-spreading,
    umbrella-shaped crown; is easily transplanted, and is suited to a
    variety of soils.

2.  Pin oak (_Quercus palustris_)

    Has a symmetrical crown with low-drooping branches; requires a moist
    situation.

3.  European linden (_Tilia microphylla_)

    Possesses a beautiful shade-bearing crown; grows well in ordinary
    soil.

4.  Red maple (_Acer rubrum_)

    Shows pleasing colors at all seasons; grows best in a fairly rich,
    moist soil.

5.  Copper beech (_Fagus sylvatica_, _alropurpurea_)

    Exceedingly beautiful in form, bark, and foliage and possesses great
    longevity and sturdiness. It is difficult to transplant and
    therefore only small trees from 6 to 10 feet in height should be
    used.

6.  Coffee tree (_Gymnocladus dioicus_)

    A unique and interesting effect is produced by its coarse branches
    and leaves. It is free from insects and disease; requires plenty of
    light; will grow in poor soils.

7.  European white birch (_Belula alba_)

    A graceful tree and very effective as a single specimen on the lawn,
    or in a group among evergreens; should be planted in early spring,
    and special care taken to protect its tender rootlets.

8.  Gingko or Maiden-hair tree (_Gingko biloba_)

    Where there is plenty of room for the spread of its odd branches,
    the gingko makes a picturesque specimen tree. It is hardy and free
    from insect pests and disease.

9.  Horsechestnut (_Aesculus hippocastanum_)

    Carries beautiful, showy flowers, and has a compact, symmetrical
    low-branched crown; is frequently subject to insects and disease.
    The red flowering horsechestnut (_A. rubicunda_) is equally
    attractive.

10. Sugar maple (_Acer saccharum_)

    Has a symmetrical crown and colors beautifully in the fall; requires
    a rich soil and considerable moisture.

11. Soulange's magnolia (_Magnolia soulangeana_)

    Extremely hard and flowers in early spring before the leaves appear.

12. Flowering dogwood (_Cornus florida_)

    Popular for its beautiful white flowers in the early spring and the
    rich coloring of its leaves in the fall; does not grow to large
    size. The red-flowering variety of this tree, though sometimes not
    quite as hardy, is extremely beautiful.

13. Japanese maple (_Acer polymorphum_)

    It has several varieties of different hues and it colors beautifully
    in the fall; it does not grow to large size.


CONIFEROUS

14. Oriental spruce (_Picea orientalis_)

    Forms a dignified, large tree with a compact crown and low branches;
    is hardy.

15. Austrian pine (_Pinus austriaca_)

    Is very hardy; possesses a compact crown; will grow in soils of
    medium quality.

16. Bhotan pine (_Pinus excelsa_)

    Grows luxuriantly; is dignified and beautiful; requires a good soil,
    and in youth needs some protection from extreme cold.

17. White pine (_Pinus strobus_)

    Branches gracefully and forms a large, dignified tree; will thrive
    on a variety of soils.

18. European larch (_Larix europaea_)

    Has a beautiful appearance; thrives best in moist situations.

19. Blue spruce (_Picea pungens_)

    Extremely hardy; forms a perfect specimen plant for the lawn.

20. Japanese umbrella pine (_Sciadopitys verlicillata_)

    Very hardy; retains a compact crown. An excellent specimen plant
    when grouped with other evergreens on the lawn. Does not grow to
    large size.

21. Mugho pine (_Pinus mughus_)

    A low-growing evergreen; hardy; important in group planting.

22. Obtuse leaf Japanese cypress (_Retinospora obtusa_)

    Beautiful evergreen of small size; hardy; desirable for group
    planting.

23. English yew (_Taxus baccata_)

    An excellent evergreen usually of low form; suitable for the lawn,
    massed with others or as a specimen plant; will grow in the shade of
    other trees. There are various forms of this species of distinctive
    value.



TREES BEST FOR THE STREET

1.  Oriental sycamore (_Platanus orientalis_)

    Very hardy; will adapt itself to city conditions; grows fairly fast
    and is highly resistant to insects and disease.

2.  Norway maple (_Acer platanoides_)

    Very hardy; possesses a straight trunk and symmetrical crown; is
    comparatively free from insects and disease and will withstand the
    average city conditions.

3.  Red oak (_Quercus rubra_)

    Fastest growing of the oaks; very durable and highly resistant to
    insects and disease; will grow in the average soil of the city
    street.

[Illustration: FIG. 93.--Street Trees. Norway Maples.]

4.  Gingko (_Gingko biloba_)

    Hardy and absolutely free from insects and disease; suited for
    narrow streets, and will permit of close planting.

5.  European linden (_Tilia microphylla_)

    Beautiful shade-bearing crown; is very responsive to good soil and
    plenty of moisture.

6.  American elm (_Ulmus americana_)

    When planted in rows along an avenue, it forms a tall majestic
    archway of great beauty. It is best suited for wide streets and
    should be planted further apart than the other trees listed above.
    Requires a fairly good soil and plenty of moisture, and is therefore
    not suited for planting in the heart of a large city.

7.  Pin oak (_Quercus palustris_)

    This tree exhibits its greatest beauty when its branches are allowed
    to droop fairly low. It, moreover, needs plenty of moisture to
    thrive and the tree is therefore best suited for streets in suburban
    sections, where these conditions can be more readily met.

8.  Red maple (_Acer rubrum_)

    Beautiful in all seasons of the year; requires a rich soil and
    considerable moisture.



TREES BEST FOR WOODLAND


FOR OPEN PLACES

1.  Red oak (_Quercus rubra_)

    Grows rapidly to large size and produces valuable wood; will grow in
    poor soil.

2.  White pine (_Pinus strobus_)

    Rapid grower; endures but little shade; wood valuable; will do well
    on large range of soils.

3.  Red pine (_Pinus resinosa_)

    Very hardy; fairly rapid growing tree.

4.  Tulip tree (_Liriodendron tulipifera_)

    Grows rapidly into a stately forest tree with a clear tall trunk;
    wood valuable; requires a fairly moist soil. Use a small tree, plant
    in the spring, and pay special attention to the protection of the
    roots in planting.

5.  Black locust (_Robinia pseudacacia_)

    Grows rapidly; adapts itself to poor, sandy soils. The wood is
    suitable for posts and ties.

6.  White ash (_Fraxinus americana_)

    Grows rapidly; prefers moist situations. Wood valuable.

7. American elm (_Ulmus americana_)

[Illustration: FIG. 94.--Woodland Trees. Red Oaks.]


FOR PLANTING UNDER THE SHADE OF OTHER TREES

9. Beech (_Fagus_)

    Will stand heavy shade; holds the soil well along banks and steep
    slopes. Both the American and the English species are desirable.

10. Hemlock (_Tsuga canadensis_)

    Will stand heavy shade and look effective in winter as well as in
    summer.

11. Dogwood (_Cornus florida_)

    and fall.



TREES BEST FOR SCREENING

1. Hemlock (_Tsuga canadensis_)

    Will stand shearing and will screen in winter as well as in summer.
    Plant from 2 to 4 feet apart to form a hedge.

2. Osage orange (_Toxylon pomiferum_)

    Very hardy. Plant close.

3. English hawthorn (_Crataegus oxyacantha_)

    Flowers beautifully and grows in compact masses. Plant close.

4. Lombardy poplar (_Populus nigra var. italica_)

    Forms a tall screen and grows under the most unfavorable conditions.
    Plant 8 to 12 feet apart.



Quality of trees: Trees grown in a nursery are preferable for
    transplanting to trees grown in the forest. Nursery-grown trees
    possess a well-developed root system with numerous fibrous rootlets,
    a straight stem, a symmetrical crown, and a well-defined leader.
    Trees grown in neighboring nurseries are preferable to those grown
