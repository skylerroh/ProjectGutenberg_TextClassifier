late years this theory, in its main outlines at all events, has
strengthened its hold on the belief of those who try to interpret
nature in the past by what we see in the present. The fact that our
system at present contains some heat in other bodies as well as in the
sun, and the fact that the laws of heat require continual loss by
radiation, demonstrate that our system, if we look back far enough,
and if the present laws have acted, must have had in part, at all
events, an origin like that which the nebular theory would suppose.

I feel that I have in the progress of these two lectures been only
able to give the merest outline of the theory of tidal evolution in
its application to the earth-moon system. Indeed I have been obliged,
by the nature of the subject, to omit almost entirely any reference to
a large body of the parts of the theory. I cannot bring myself to
close these lectures without just alluding to this omission, and
without giving expression to the fact, that I feel it is impossible
for me to have rendered adequate justice to the strength of the
argument on which we claim that tidal evolution is the most rational
mode of accounting for the present condition in which we find the
earth-moon system. Of course it will be understood that we have never
contended that the tides offer the only conceivable theory as to the
present condition of things. The argument lies in this wise. A certain
body of facts are patent to our observation. The tides offer an
explanation as to the origin of these facts. The tides are a _vera
causa_, and in the absence of other suggested causes, the tidal theory
holds the field. But much will depend on the volume and the
significance of the group of associated facts of which the doctrine
offers a solution. The facts that it has been in my power to discuss
within the compass of discourses like the present, only give a very
meagre and inadequate notion of the entire phenomena connected with
the moon which the tides will explain. We have not unfrequently, for
the sake of simplicity, spoken of the moon's orbit as circular, and we
have not even alluded to the fact that the plane of that orbit is
inclined to the ecliptic. A comprehensive theory of the moon's origin
should render an account of the eccentricity of the moon's orbit; it
must also involve the obliquity of the ecliptic, the inclination of
the moon's orbit, and the direction of the moon's axis. I have been
perforce compelled to omit the discussion of these attributes of the
earth-moon system, and in doing so I have inflicted what is really an
injustice on the tidal theory. For it is the chief claim of the theory
of tidal evolution, as expounded by Professor Darwin, that it links
together all these various features of the earth-moon system. It
affords a connected explanation, not only of the fact that the moon
always turns the same face to the earth, but also of the eccentricity
of the moon's path around the earth, and the still more difficult
points about the inclinations of the various axes and orbits of the
planets. It is the consideration of these points that forms the
stronghold of the doctrine of tidal evolution. For when we find that a
theory depending upon influences that undoubtedly exist, and are in
ceaseless action around us, can at the same time bring into connection
and offer a common explanation of a number of phenomena which would
otherwise have no common bond of union, it is impossible to refuse to
believe that such a theory does actually correspond to nature.

The greatest of mathematicians have ever found in astronomy problems
which tax, and problems which greatly surpass, the utmost efforts of
which they are capable. The usual way in which the powers of the
mathematician have been awakened into action is by the effort to
remove some glaring discrepancy between an imperfect theory and the
facts of observation. The genius of a Laplace or a Lagrange was
expended, and worthily expended, in efforts to show how one planet
acted on another planet, and produced irregularities in its orbit; the
genius of an Adams and a Leverrier was nobly applied to explain the
irregularities in the motion of Uranus, and to discover a cause of
those irregularities in the unseen Neptune. In all these cases, and in
many others which might be mentioned, the mathematician has been
stimulated by the laudable anxiety to clear away some blemish from the
theory of gravitation throughout the system. The blemish was seen to
exist before its removal was suggested. In that application of
mathematics with which we have been concerned in these lectures the
call for the mathematician has been of quite a different kind. A
certain familiar phenomenon on our sea-coasts has invited attention.
The tidal ripples murmur a secret, but not for every ear. To interpret
that secret fully, the hearer must be a mathematician. Even then the
interpretation can only be won after the profoundest efforts of
thought and attention, but at last the language has been made
intelligible. The labour has been gloriously rewarded, and an
interesting chapter of our earth's history has for the first time been
written.

In the progress of these lectures I have sought to interest you in
those profound investigations which the modern mathematician has made
in his efforts to explore the secrets of nature. He has felt that the
laws of motion, as we understand them, are bounded by no
considerations of space, are limited by no duration of time, and he
has commenced to speculate on the logical consequences of those laws
when time of indefinite duration is assumed to be at his disposal.
From the very nature of the case, observations for confirmation were
impossible. Phenomena that required millions of years for their
development cannot be submitted to the instruments in our
observatories. But this is perhaps one of the special reasons which
make such investigations of peculiar interest, and entitle us to speak
of the revelations of Time and Tide as a romance of modern science.
