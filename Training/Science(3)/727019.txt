captain. They ought to help me ... they ... He knew though that they
would not. They were a fierce, proud people and the law of single combat
would apply even to the captain who had piloted them across an unknown
ocean.

Pietro came by, attempting to slash with his knife from outside. Danny
moved quickly--not quick enough. The knife point caught his arm this
time. He felt his hand go numb. His own knife clattered to the deck as
blood oozed from his biceps.

Once more Pietro charged him. Weaponless, Danny waited. Pietro was
laughing, sure of himself--

Careless.

Danny slipped aside as Pietro brought the knife around in a wicked
swipe. He spun with it and when he came around Danny was waiting for
him. He drove his left fist into the great belly and his right to the
big, bearded jaw. Pietro slumped, disbelief in his eyes. He swung the
knife again but only succeeded in wrapping his giant arm around Danny.
He bent his head, shook it to clear it of the sting of Danny's blows.
And Danny rabbit-punched him.

Pietro went down heavily and someone shouted. "The face! Kick him in the
face!"

Wearily, Danny shook his head. He went with Nina to the rail and saw the
green palm-fringed island of the New World. Nina smiled at him, then
ripped something from what she was wearing and began to bandage his
ribs, his arm.

       *       *       *       *       *

They heard a splash. Danny looked around, saw Don Hernan and a member of
the crew gazing serenely down. Pietro was down there, where they had
tossed him. For a while the body floated, then the limbs splashed wildly
as Pietro regained consciousness. He drifted back away from the ship. He
went under, and came up. He went under again, and stayed under....

"The Indies," Nina said.

"The Indies," Danny said. He did not make the distinction between east
and west. They must learn for themselves.

The Pinta and the Santa Maria came up alongside. All thoughts of pursuit
were gone. Columbus waved. He was very close now on the deck of the
Santa Maria. There was something in his face, something changed.
Columbus was a new man now. He had been shamed. He had followed his
daughter and Martin Pinzon across an unknown ocean and he was changed
now. Somehow, Danny knew he could now make voyages on his own.

"Martin," Nina whispered. "They may say it was father. But it was you.
I'll know in my heart, it was you."

Danny nodded. She put her arm around his shoulder, and kissed him. He
liked this slim girl--he liked her immensely, and it wasn't right. She
wasn't his, not really. She was Martin Pinzon's. He let the Spaniard
come to the surface, willed his own mind back and down and away. She's
all yours, Pinzon, he told the other mind in his body. She--and this
world. I'm a--stranger here.

But once more he kissed Nina, fiercely, with passion and longing.

"Goodbye, my darling," he said.

"Goodbye! What--"

He let Martin Pinzon take it from there. "Hello," said Martin Pinzon.
"I mean, hello forever, darling."

She laughed. "Goodbye to your bachelorhood, you mean."

"Yes," he said. "Yes."

But it was Martin Pinzon talking now. Completely Martin Pinzon.

He was back in his grand-uncle's basement. He was in the trunk and he
felt stiff. Mostly, his right arm and the right ribs felt stiff. He felt
his shirt. It was caked with blood.

Proof, he thought. If I needed proof. What happened to Pinzon happened
to me.

He stood up. He felt weak, but knew he would be all right. He knew about
Columbus now. At first, a weak drunkard. But after the first voyage,
thanks to Martin Pinzon and Nina, an intrepid voyager. For history said
Columbus would make four voyages to the New World--and four he would
make.

Danny went outside, to where the lawyer was waiting for him. The trunk
was Danny's now, the time trunk. And he would use it again, often. He
knew that now, and it was wrong to deflate a dream.

Columbus was a hero. He would never say otherwise again.
