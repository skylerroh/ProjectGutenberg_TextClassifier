                          LORD TEDRIC

                 _By Edward E. Smith, Ph. D._

                  _Illustrated by Lawrence_

    Time is the strangest of all mysteries. Relatively unimportant
    events, almost unnoticed as they occur, may, in hundreds of years,
    result in Ultimate Catastrophe. On Time Track Number One, that was
    the immutable result. But on Time Track Number Two there was one
    little event that could be used to avert it--the presence of a
    naked woman in public. So, Skandos One removed the clothing from
    the Lady Rhoann and after one look, Lord Tedric did the rest!


_Skandos One (The Skandos of Time Track Number One, numbered
for reasons which will become clear) showed, by means of the
chronoviagraph, that civilization would destroy itself in one hundred
eighty-seven years. To prevent this catastrophe he went back to the key
point in time and sought out the key figure--one Tedric, a Lomarrian
ironmaster who had lived and died a commoner; unable, ever, to do
anything about his fanatical detestation of human sacrifice._

_Skandos One taught Tedric how to make one batch of super-steel;
watched him forge armor and arms from that highly anachronistic alloy.
He watched him do things that Tedric of Time Track One had never done._

_Time, then_, did _fork. Time Track One was probably no longer in
existence. He must have been saved by his "traction" on the reality
of Time Track Two. He'd snap back up to his own time and see what
the situation was. If he found his assistant Furmin alone in the
laboratory, the extremists would have been proved wrong. If not...._

_Furmin was not alone. Instead, Skandos Two and Furmin Two were at work
on a tri-di of Tedric's life: so like, and yet so wildly unlike, the
one upon which Skandos One and Furmin One had labored so long!_

_Shaken and undecided, Skandos One held his machine at the very verge
of invisibility and watched and listened._

_"But it's so maddeningly incomplete!" Skandos Two snorted. "When it
goes into such fine detail on almost everything else, why can't we
get how he stumbled onto one lot, and never any other, of high-alloy
steel--chrome-nickel-vanadium-molybdenum-tungsten steel--Mortensen's
super-steel, to be specific--which wasn't rediscovered for thousands of
years?"_

_"Why, it was revealed to him by his personal god Llosir--don't you
remember?" Furmin snickered._

_"Poppycock!"_

_"To us, yes; but not to them. Hence, no detail, and you know why we
can't go back and check."_

_"Of course. We simply don't know enough about time ... but I would so
like to study this Lord of the Marches at first hand! Nowhere else in
all reachable time does any other one entity occupy such a uniquely key
position!"_

_"So would I, chief. If we knew just a_ little _more I'd say go. In the
meantime, let's run that tri-di again, to see if we've overlooked any
little thing!"_

_In the three-dimensional, full-color projection Armsmaster Lord
Tedric destroyed the principal images of the monstrous god Sarpedion
and killed Sarpedion's priests. He rescued Lady Rhoann, King Phagon's
eldest daughter, from the sacrificial altar. The king made him Lord of
the Marches, the Highest of the High._

_"This part I like." Furmin pressed a stud; the projector stopped. A
blood-smeared armored giant and a blood-smeared naked woman stood, arms
around each other, beside a blood-smeared altar of green stone. "Talk
about being STACKED! If I hadn't checked the data myself I'd swear you
went overboard there, chief."_

_"Exact likenesses--life size," Skandos Two grunted. "Tedric: six-four,
two-thirty, muscled just like that. Rhoann: six feet and half an inch,
one-ninety. The only time she ever appeared in the raw in public, I
guess, but she didn't turn a hair."_

_"What a couple!" Furmin stared enviously. "We don't have people like
that any more."_

_"Fortunately, no. He could split a full-armored man in two with a
sword; she could strangle a tiger bare-handed. So what? All the brains
of the whole damned tribe, boiled down into one, wouldn't equip a
half-wit."_

_"Oh, I wouldn't say that," Furmin objected. "Phagon was a smooth,
shrewd operator."_

_"In a way--sometimes--but committing suicide by wearing gold armor
instead of high-alloy steel doesn't show much brain-power."_

_"I'm not sure I'll buy that, either. There were terrific
pressures ... but say Phagon had worn steel, that day at Middlemarch
Castle, and lived ten or fifteen years longer? My guess is that Tedric
would have changed the map of the world. He wasn't stupid, you know;
just bull-headed, and Phagon could handle him. He would have pounded a
lot of sense into his skull, if he had lived."_

_"However, he didn't live," Skandos returned dryly, "and so every
decision Tedric ever made was wrong. But to get back to the point, did
you see anything new?"_

_"Not a thing."_

_"Neither did I. So go and see how eight twelve is doing."_

_For Time Test Number Eight Hundred Eleven had failed; and there was
little ground for hope that Number Eight Hundred Twelve would be any
more productive._

_And the lurking Skandos One who had been studying intensively
every aspect of the situation, began to act. It was crystal clear
that Time Track Two could hold only one Skandos. One of them would
have to vanish--completely, immediately, and permanently. Although
in no sense a killer, by instinct or training, only one course of
action was possible if his own life--and, as a matter of fact, all
civilization--were to be conserved. Wherefore he synchronized, and shot
his unsuspecting double neatly through the head. The living Skandos
changed places with the dead. A timer buzzed briefly. The time-machine
disappeared; completely out of synchronization with any continuum that
a world's keenest brain and an ultra-fast calculator could compute._

_This would of course make another fork in time, but that fact did not
bother Skandos One at all--now. As for Tedric; since the big, dumb lug
couldn't be made to believe that he, Skandos One, was other than a god,
he'd_ be _a god--in spades!_

_He'd build an image of flesh-like plastic exactly like the copper
statue Tedric had made, and go back and announce himself publicly
as the god Llosir. He'd come back--along Time-Track Three, of
