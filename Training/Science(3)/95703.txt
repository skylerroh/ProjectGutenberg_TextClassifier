
In the cube, Billie Jackson would not have stumbled over such a speech.
She would have ignored the fact that Estra was holding her hand all this
time, and gazing deep into her eyes; she would have been filled with
what she was saying and not with what she was seeing. On the other side
of the room, Van Emmon watched and glowered; he could not hear.

The Venusian lifted his head suddenly. The voices from the telephone had
subsided; only an occasional outburst came from the instrument. Estra
closed his eyes again for a second, and when he opened them again, his
manner was astonishingly alert, and his speech swift and to the point.

"So far as we know, Billie, the method has no flaws. It gives us the
chance to throw off our lower selves; and if by so doing, we reduce the
race to a single sex, only--"

He stopped short, as though at a sound; and with a word of apology
stepped from the room. He opened another door, far down the corridor;
and as he passed through, the wail of a new-born infant came faintly to
the four.

"Wonder what's up?" said Smith. Van Emmon, who had gone to the window,
whirled upon the engineer and motioned him to his side.

"Look at the people!"

Smith saw that the nearby houses were almost concealed by a throng which
had gathered, silently and without confusion, during the past few
minutes. Their numbers were increasing swiftly, fresh arrivals packing
the background. People filled the streets; the space below Estra's
balcony was already crowded as closely as it could be. Except for a low-
voiced buzzing, there was no disturbance.

Billie came up. She seemed to divine the temper of the mob. She caught
her breath sharply, and then said, very simply:

"It reminds me of--Bethlehem."

But the words had scarcely left her mouth before an uproar sounded from
one end of the street below. A crowd of excited Venusians was pushing
its way determinedly toward the house, their passage obstructed by
shouting, protesting individuals. Van Emmon's breast began to heave; he
fancied he saw blows struck.

"By George!" he exclaimed, next second. "They're fighting!"

It was true; a hand-to-hand battle was going on less than a block away.
The people below the window surged in the direction of the fight; all
were shouting, now; the clamor was deafening.

"Live and let live!" came one of the shouts. It was taken up by the
group that was doing the attacking, and made into a cheer. Then came
other cries from them. Smith made out something like "Down with sex
monopoly!"

"Don't you see?" shouted Smith, above the din. "These people below are
Estra's friends; those newcomers are backing Savarona! Get the idea?" he
repeated. "If Estra wins out, the old boy with the fountain of youth
will never get another boy baby to experiment on!"

"What!" The doctor leaped to their sides. He took it in at a glance;
then whirled to the door. "We ought to warn Estra!"

"He knows it already!" reminded Billie swiftly. A great shout came from
below; the attackers had forced their way through the crowd of Estra's
friends.

"Well!" Van Emmon stood squarely in the middle of the room. "So far as
I'm concerned, Estra and his sister can face that crowd alone! I don't
approve of the scheme!"

The doctor eyed him thoughtfully. "I'm not so sure, Van. This is a
tremendous thing; we ought to--"

"Van is--right!" exploded Billie. Her voice rose to a shriek as a crash
shook the house.

Next instant Myrin, for once in a hurry, broke into the room. She
glanced about, missed Estra, looked slightly puzzled, and then frowned
angrily as the Venusian himself stepped in: "You fooled me!" she shot at
him. But he smiled apologetically. He was carrying a large package of
leaflets, closely printed in Venusian; there seemed to be several
thousand in the lot. He said, by way of explanation:

"I had to get ready. Savarona's people will be here any moment; they
have destroyed the elevator, and--"

A wave of clamor burst from below. "They've broken the barrier,"
remarked Estra calmly; he turned to the door, then whirled at a crash
which sounded from above. "Through the roof," he added. He did not even
glance at the balcony, where the two cars barred the way against any
attack from that direction.

Next second he again quit the room. Myrin hesitated a moment,
irresolute, and then followed him thoughtfully. They never saw her
again. As for Estra, he came back in a moment carrying a small, white
bundle, which stirred in his arms. He unhesitatingly handed the child to
Billie. His mouth moved soundlessly as a muffled shriek arose from the
other end of the corridor; there was a thud, a metallic crash, and a
great roar of voices. The mob had broken in, and up, through the back of
the house. The first of the attackers thrust his head and shoulders into
sight not ten feet away.

Estra touched something with his foot, and a door shot across the
corridor. There was an instant's silence; then, the thunder of the mob,
hurling itself against the door. The people were fairly snarling now.
Estra closed the inner door.

"Estra!" shrilly, from Billie. She laid the baby down, and strode to the
Venusian. "Let's get out of here! The car's on the balcony; nobody's in
the way to interfere! Why not--"

A grinding, ripping jar from above, and Estra shook his head. The smile
was gone, and his mouth was set and grim. "They'd catch us before we
went a mile," he said, glancing at the infant, who had begun to cry, in
a stifled, gasping way that tore at the nerves.

"Estra!" Billie pleaded; but he turned away. The doctor strode up to him
and gripped his shoulder.

"What's the good, Estra? What can you accomplish even if you--"

The Venusian tapped his forehead. "I can TELL!" he exclaimed, with a
return of that exalted flush. "Just give me a chance to offer my
sister's discovery to the world, and I shall be satisfied!" He touched
the package of leaflets. "These are not written as clearly as they
should be; but if I cannot hold them back, then these"--fingering the
papers--"these go to the friends down below!" He moved closer to the
window, but his eyes were on the door.

A rending crash told that the corridor was now open to the mob. There
was a rush, and then the storm of the people battering the last door.

"Van! Doc! Billie!" Smith had the window open, and was stepping into one
of the cars. Kinney and the geologist were at his side in an instant.
The girl held back.

"Estra!" she begged. She picked up the baby, and with her free hand
tugged at the Venusian's arm. "Come on! Don't sacrifice yourself!"

The door bulged under the attack. The noise was ear-splitting.
Nevertheless Estra heard, and shook his head without looking at the
woman from the Earth. She dashed to the window, then came back. "Hurry!
There's a chance!" He stood unmoved, watchful and ready. "Estra! I want
you to come!" Her face flamed. "Can't you see? Can't you see that I--I
want you?" She gasped as the door shrieked under the strain. "Come--if
you're a man!"

The Venusian's face changed. He turned, and stared at the girl with eyes
that held nothing but blank amazement. The grimness left his mouth, his
lips partly opened. He took a step forward and threw an arm about her
shoulders.

"Billie--I'm sorry! I never thought!" A crack showed at the edge of the
door, and a roar smote their ears. Estra backed to the window. "Go!" he
shouted. "Go quickly, while you can!"

Billie stood stock still, gazing at him. "I'm going to stay!" she
screamed. "I'll take my chances with--"

He thrust her through the window. "You don't understand!" he shouted,
and took the baby away from her, despite all her strength. Then a
wonderfully tender light came into his eyes. He gripped Billie's hands,
and spoke sorrowfully:

"Billie--I'm not what you thought! I'm not a man--I'm a woman!"



XV

BACK!


By the time Smith had driven the strange craft fifty yards, he had it
under control. Billie glanced back; Estra was out on the balcony, now,
and the mob was surging against the windows she had locked against them.
She shifted the baby to the hollow of one arm while with the other she
broke the cord of the packet.

At the sight, the crowd in the street gave voice. "Let us have it!" they
were crying; they drowned out the uproar within the house. Estra did not
even look at the other car.

Then the windows gave way. Like the breaking of a dam, a flood of
Venusians poured and tumbled at Estra's feet. She raised her hand, and
shouted something Billie could not hear; then, scarcely without pause,
the crowd bore down upon her.

And even as she was crushed against the railing, with one hand she
dropped the baby to eager, upstretched arms below; and with the other
she tossed the package high in the air. There it broke apart, the air
caught it, and the thousands of leaflets fluttered down upon that street
full of sympathizers.

Leaflets, each of which described a discovery which was to give to women
the power of abolishing the opposite sex, of making Venus a world not
only one in country, one in industry and one in thought, but--one in
sex!

The thunderous meaning of Estra's last action almost made Billie forget
that it was, in truth, the woman's last act. For next moment her
lifeless form was being crushed beneath the feet of that supremely
cultured, marvelously civilized mob; for it was only a mob, despite its
astounding advancement; a mob which had retained all the brute's
fanaticism, and all the male jealousy of the female.

For they were all men.


The four had been on Venus almost twenty-four hours when Smith, knowing
the condition of the machinery in the cube, warned the others that they
must return. Secretly, he was tired of the Venusians' continual smiling;
for they had fairly outdone each other to show the visitors all that
could be shown. But it was Van Emmon who thought to ask for Estra's
wonderful library.

"These chemicals and metals you are giving us," he said, making a
regular speech of it, "are extremely welcome; they will enable us to
perform experiments otherwise out of our reach.

"But Estra's books will mean still more to the people of the earth. If
there is no one else with more need for them, who is going to put in a
claim, then why not let us have them?"

Apparently the Venusians did not like the idea very well. "They must
have thought it was like letting a monkey play with a rifle," the doctor
afterward put it. But, for lack of a leader with any motive for
objecting, and because Estra had no living relatives to claim the
library, somehow that incredible collection of intellectual gems got
into the possession of the four. Nothing was said about it during the
quiet leave-taking, and when the cube finally rose away from the roof,
Van Emmon's face beamed with happiness and a great sigh of satisfaction
escaped him.

"Well"--looking at the books--"they kind of make up for the fact that
the folks didn't ask us to call again!"

And he turned and went straight to the kitchenette, where he proceeded
with great speed and efficiency to set out the following:

Canned Soup. Canned baked beans. Fried bacon and egg. Coffee. Peaches.

"Come and get it!" he shouted. The doctor tore himself away from the
books; Smith crawled out from the beloved machines; Billie came out
shortly from her cubby-hole, and slipped into her seat in a highly
excited manner. There was a brightness in her cheeks, and a noticeable
change in her usually assured manner. This timidity, so utterly new to
the girl, seemed most pronounced whenever Van Emmon chanced to look at
her; which was quite often.

All four were ravenous. They had been away from the cube a day and a
night, and "all we had to eat was something to drink," as Smith
complained. Nothing whatever was said except "Please pass that" and
"Thanks," for fully fifteen minutes.

At last they were satisfied. The doctor went back to the books; Smith
returned to his oil-can and wrench. But Billie stood by the table, and
began helping Van Emmon to clear up. In a moment they were face to face.

"Van," she said softly, and looked up at him wistfully. "Van--do you
like me better this way?" Her eyes were almost piteous.

Into the man's face there came a look of amazement followed by one of
admiration, and another of genuine delight He gave a little laugh, and
unconsciously threw out his hands.

"Much better, Billie." Neither of them cared a particle whether Smith or
the doctor saw that Billie, very simply and naturally, walked right into
Van Emmon's arms. "Much better. Besides, you're really too graceful to
wear anything else."

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
