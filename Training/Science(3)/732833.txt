
She felt a warm sense of relief, of gratitude, that she could remember
them without shame. The nurse had been right, of course. Probably the
doctors had planted that particular nurse in her room, anticipating her
return to consciousness, anticipating the necessity for a little mental
therapy.

_Good female sense._ With such a semantic difference from good male
sense! The mind of a man and a woman was not the same. She knew that
now. And she realized that deeply, hidden from her own admittance, she
had always known it. And the nurse's good earthy
expression--"propositioning those two guys"--approval that it had been
natural and right. And another expression, "the way you pitched in
there, carried your share of things."

Carried your share of things! That meant more than just cooking,
mending, cleaning. More than just seeing that the race continued, too;
although it somehow tied in with all these things.

She lay in her bed, watching the rain through the window, getting
comfort from the soft, drumming sound. Along the street she could see
people sloshing through the film of water underfoot. She watched the
scene of turned-up collars, pulled-down hatbrims, bobbing umbrellas, as
if it were something apart from her, and yet a part of her. She began to
get a sense of rare vision, an understanding which she knew was more
complete than any intellectual abstraction she had ever managed. She
began to get a woman's sense of purpose, completely distinct from that
of a man.

She recalled once reading of an incident where an Oklahoma oil
millionaire had built a huge mansion; then, because his squaw did not
know how to make a home within it, they pitched their tepee in the front
grounds, to live there, unable to feel at home in anything else.

Yes, too often the mansions of science came in for a similar treatment.
The vast rooms of ideas, the great halls of expansion, the limitless
ceilings of challenge, the wide expanses of speculation; all these
things which would exalt Man into a truly great existence were denied,
put to no use beyond mere gadgetry. And the mass of human beings still
huddled in their cramped and grimy little tepees of ancient syndromes,
only there feeling at home.

It was the fault of the women. They had not kept up with the men. Those
who attempted it tried to be men, to prove themselves as good a man as
any man, the way she had done.

They had missed the real point entirely, every single bit of it.

The male was still functioning in the way males always had. There was no
essential difference between the cave man who climbed a new mountain and
explored a new valley and brought back a speared deer to throw down at
the entrance of his home cave; no difference between him and the modern
explorer of science who, under similar hardships, brought back a bright
and rich new knowledge.

But the ancient cave woman had not failed. She had known what to do with
the deer to strengthen and secure the future of the race.

And what about New Earth?

Lt. Harper and Sam had talked about the possibility of millions of
Earths, each infinitesimally removed from the other, and if they could
bridge the gap to one, they might bridge it to an uncountable number.
Perhaps there were millions of others, but for her there was only one
New Earth.

Would the processions of colonists going there spoil it? Would the women
going there see in it a great mansion? Or, instead, would they simply go
there to escape here--escape from exhaustion, failure, anguish,
bitterness--and, as always, take these things along with them? Would
they still live in grimy little syndromes of endless antagonism,
bickering in their foolish frustrations, because they had no wisdom
about what to do with this newly speared deer?

_Oh, not on New Earth!_

Suddenly Miss Kitty knew what she must do. If that one particular
mansion needed someone to make it into a home, why not herself? And who
had a better right?

Somewhere, there, perhaps that very one striding along under the eaves
of that building across the street, with his hatbrim pulled down,
leaning against the rain, somewhere, close, there must be a man who
could share her resolution and her dream. A man of the same breed as the
lieutenant and Sam, a man who carried his head high, his shoulders back,
who had keen, intelligent eyes, and laughter.

Yes, now she wanted to see the two men after all, and meet their lucky
wives, and see their children, the kind of children she might have had.

Might _yet_ have!

At a flash of memory, she smiled a little ruefully, and yet with an
inner peace.

"I am not so old," she repeated in a whisper. "I still have time for at
least a half dozen sons and daughters before--before my barren years."
