Terminology

  oxy-muriatic acid = chlorine
    (proposed as an element in 1815: see Conversation XIX)
  "columbium or tantalium" = niobium and tantalum
    (the two elements always occur together, and were not recognized
    as separate until much later in the 19th century)
  phosphat of lime = calcium diphosphate _or_ calcium
    (the element calcium was isolated in 1808, but is named only once
    in this 1817 edition)
  glucium = beryllium (Humphry Davy's name for the element)

  muriatic acid = hydrochloric acid
    (still called "muriatic acid" for some commercial uses)
  muriat of lime = calcium chloride
  oxymuriate of potash = potassium chlorate
  muriat of soda = sodium chloride (table salt)
  carbonic acid = carbon dioxide

Note also:

  simple body, fundamental principle = element
  fecula = starch (usually spelled "faecula")
  spirit of wine = alcohol
  philosopher = scientist
  arts = industry, manufacture, crafts etc. (seldom "fine arts")

Some essential concepts relating to living things--photosynthesis,
microorganisms, the cell, proteins--are either unknown or not mentioned.
The atom theory had been proposed, but not by Humphry Davy; it is not
mentioned in this book.

The word "explode" is used at least once in its orginal, figurative
sense ("a word that should be exploded in chemistry") but far more
often in its later, concrete one. The word "explosion" is always used
concretely ("an explosion, or a _detonation_ as chemists commonly call
it").

Calculated Values:

"the point of zero, or the absolute privation of heat, must consequently
be 1260 degrees below 32 degrees"

  [-1228 deg. F. The calculation is based on wrong premises; the correct
  figure is about -460 deg. F or -273 deg. C.]

"Mercury congeals only at seventy-two degrees below the freezing point."

  [-40 deg. F, which is also -40 deg. C. This figure is correct, though
  approximate.]

"The proportion stated by Sir H. Davy, in his Chemical Researches, is as
1 to 2.389."

"[ammonia] consisted of about one part of hydrogen to four parts of
nitrogen.... and from the latest and most accurate experiments, the
proportions appear to be, one volume of nitrogen gas to three of
hydrogen gas"

  [These and similar calculations involving weight and volume make more
  sense when one knows the elements' atomic weights. For nitric acid,
  HNO_3, the figures are 1:14:48, giving a proportion closer to 1:3.5.
  For ammonia, NH_3 (not 4), the figures are 14:3.]

"The _oxalic acid_, distilled from sorrel, is the highest term of
vegetable acidification; for, if more oxygen be added to it, it loses
its vegetable nature, and is resolved into carbonic acid and water;"

  [Oxalic acid = H_2C_2O_4; carbonic acid (carbon dioxide) = CO_2.
  H_2C_2O_4 + O becomes H_2O + CO_2 + CO_2.]

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
