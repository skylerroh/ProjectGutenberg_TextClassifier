_K_, cross-section of a nearly ripe seed, showing the crumpled embryo,
x 2. _L_, an embryo removed from a nearly ripe seed, and spread out;

The first order (_Tubiflorae_) has, as the name indicates, tubular
flowers which show usually perfect, radial symmetry (_Actinomorphism_).
There are five families, all represented by familiar plants. The first
(_Convolvulaceae_) has as its type the morning-glory (_Convolvulus_)
(Fig. 118, _G_), and the nearly related _Ipomoeas_ of the gardens. The
curious dodder (_Cuscuta_), whose leafless, yellow stems are sometimes
very conspicuous, twining over various plants, is a member of this
family which has lost its chlorophyll through parasitic habits. The
sweet potato (_Batatas_) is also a member of the morning-glory family.
The numerous species, wild and cultivated, of phlox (Fig. 118, _A_),
and the blue valerian (_Polemonium_) (Fig. 118, _D_), are examples of
the family _Polemoniaceae_.

x 1. _H_, flower of _Petunia_ (_Solaneae_), x 1/2. _I_, diagram of the

The third family (_Hydrophyllaceae_) includes several species of
water-leaf (_Hydrophyllum_) (Fig. 118, _E_) and _Phacelia_, among our
wild flowers, and species of _Nemophila_, _Whitlavia_ and others from
the western states, but now common in gardens.

The Borage family (_Borragineae_) includes the forget-me-not
(_Myosotis_) and a few pretty wild flowers, _e.g._ the orange-flowered
puccoons (_Lithospermum_); but it also embraces a number of the most
troublesome weeds, among which are the hound's-tongue (_Cynoglossum_)
(Fig. 119, _A_), and the "beggar's-ticks" (_Echinospermum_), whose
prickly fruits (Fig. 119, _C_) become detached on the slightest
provocation, and adhere to whatever they touch with great tenacity.
The flowers in this family are arranged in one-sided inflorescences
which are coiled up at first and straighten as the flowers expand.

The last family (_Solaneae_) includes the nightshades (_Solanum_)
(Fig. 119, _D_), to which genus the potato (_S. tuberosum_) and the
egg-plant (_S. Melongena_) also belong. Many of the family contain a
poisonous principle, _e.g._ the deadly nightshade (_Atropa_), tobacco
(_Nicotiana_), stramonium (_Datura_), and others. Of the cultivated
plants, besides those already mentioned, the tomato (_Lycopersicum_),
and various species of _Petunia_ (Fig. 119, _H_), _Solanum_, and
_Datura_ are the commonest.

The second order of the _Anisocarpae_ consists of plants whose flowers
usually exhibit very marked, bilateral symmetry (_Zygomorphism_). From
the flower often being two-lipped (see Fig. 120), the name of the
order (_Labiatiflorae_) is derived.

Of the nine families constituting the order, all but one are
represented within our limits, but the great majority belong to two
families, the mints (_Labiatae_) and the figworts (_Scrophularineae_).
The mints are very common and easily recognizable on account of their
square stems, opposite leaves, strongly bilabiate flowers, and the
ovary splitting into four seed-like fruits (Fig. 120, _D_, _F_).

  The great majority of them, too, have the surface covered with
  glandular hairs secreting a strong-scented volatile oil, giving the
  peculiar odor to these plants. The dead nettle (_Lamium_) (Fig. 120,
  _A_) is a thoroughly typical example. The sage, mints, catnip,
  thyme, lavender, etc., will recall the peculiarities of the family.

The stamens are usually four in number through the abortion of one of
them, but sometimes only two perfect stamens are present.

(_Lentibulariaceae_), x 1. _x_, one of the "traps." _P_, a single trap,
x 5.]

The _Scrophularineae_ differ mainly from the _Labiatae_ in having round
stems, and the ovary not splitting into separate one-seeded fruits.
The leaves are also sometimes alternate. There are generally four
stamens, two long and two short, as in the labiates, but in the
mullein (_Verbascum_) (Fig. 120, _M_), where the flower is only
slightly zygomorphic, there is a fifth rudimentary stamen, while in
others (_e.g._ _Veronica_) (Fig. 120, _J_) there are but two stamens.
Many have large, showy flowers, as in the cultivated foxglove
(_Digitalis_), and the native species of _Gerardia_, mullein,
_Mimulus_, etc., while a few like the figwort, _Scrophularia_
(Fig. 120, _H_), and speedwells (_Veronica_) have duller-colored or
smaller flowers.

the stamens are not yet ripe. _H_, a flower from the upper (younger)
part of the spike. _I_, an older expanded flower, with ripe stamens,
x 3.]

The curious bladder-weed (_Utricularia_) is the type of the family
_Lentibulariaceae_, aquatic or semi-aquatic plants which possess
special contrivances for capturing insects or small water animals.
These in the bladder-weed are little sacs (Fig. 120, _P_) which act as
traps from which the animals cannot escape after being captured. There
does not appear to be here any actual digestion, but simply an
absorption of the products of decomposition, as in the pitcher-plant.
In the nearly related land form, _Pinguicula_, however, there is much
the same arrangement as in the sundew.

The family _Gesneraceae_ is mainly a tropical one, represented in the
greenhouses by the magnificent _Gloxinia_ and _Achimenes_, but of
native plants there are only a few parasitic forms destitute of
chlorophyll and with small, inconspicuous flowers. The commonest of
these is _Epiphegus_, a much-branched, brownish plant, common in
autumn about the roots of beech-trees upon which it is parasitic, and
whence it derives its common name, "beech-drops."

The bignonia family (_Bignoniaceae_) is mainly tropical, but in our
southern states is represented by the showy trumpet-creeper (_Tecoma_)
(Fig. 121, _A_), the catalpa, and _Martynia_.

The other plants likely to be met with by the student belong either to
the _Verbenaceae_, represented by the showy verbenas of the gardens,
and our much less showy wild vervains, also belonging to the genus
_Verbena_ (Fig. 121, _E_); or to the plantain family (_Plantagineae_),
of which the various species of plantain (_Plantago_) are familiar to
every one (Fig. 121, _G_, _I_). The latter seem to be forms in which
the flowers have become inconspicuous, and are wind fertilized, while
probably all of its showy-flowered relatives are dependent on insects
for fertilization.

The third order (_Contortae_) of the _Anisocarpae_ includes five
families, all represented by familiar forms. The first, the olive
family (_Oleaceae_), besides the olive, contains the lilac and jasmine
among cultivated plants, and the various species of ash (_Fraxinus_),
and the pretty fringe-tree (_Chionanthus_) (Fig. 122, _A_), often
cultivated for its abundant white flowers. The other families are the
_Gentianaceae_ including the true gentians (_Gentiana_) (Fig. 122,
_F_), the buck-bean (_Menyanthes_), the centauries (_Erythraea_ and
_Sabbatia_), and several other less familiar genera; _Loganiaceae_,
with the pink-root (_Spigelia_) (Fig. 122, _D_), as the best-known
example; _Apocynaceae_ including the dog-bane (_Apocynum_) (Fig. 122,
_H_), and in the gardens the oleander and periwinkle (_Vinca_).

_gy._ pistil. _p_, pollen masses. _an._ stamen. _M_, a pair of pollen
masses, x 6. _N_, a nearly ripe seed, x 1.]

The last family is the milk-weeds (_Asclepiadaceae_), which have
extremely complicated flowers. Our numerous milk-weeds (Fig. 122, _K_)
are familiar representatives, and exhibit perfectly the peculiarities
of the family. Like the dog-banes, the plants contain a milky juice
which is often poisonous. Besides the true milk-weeds (_Asclepias_),
there are several other genera within the United States, but mostly
southern in their distribution. Many of them are twining plants and
occasionally cultivated for their showy flowers. Of the cultivated
forms, the wax-plant (_Hoya_), and _Physianthus_ are the commonest.

[Illustration: FIG. 123.--_Anisocarpous sympetalae_ (_Campanulinae_).

(_Campanulaceae_), x 2. _B_, an expanded flower, x 1. The stamens have

The fourth order (_Campanulinae_) also embraces five families, but of
these only three are represented among our wild plants. The
bell-flowers (_Campanula_) (Fig. 123, _A_, _D_) are examples of the
family _Campanulaceae_, and numerous species are common, both wild and
cultivated.

x 1/4. _fl._ flowers. _Q_, a single flower, x 1. _R_, the same, with the

The various species of _Lobelia_, of which the splendid
cardinal-flower (_L. Cardinalis_) (Fig. 123, _E_) is one of the most
beautiful, represent the very characteristic family _Lobeliaceae_.
Their milky juice contains more or less marked poisonous properties.
The last family of the order is the gourd family (_Cucurbitaceae_),
represented by a few wild species, but best known by the many
cultivated varieties of melons, cucumbers, squashes, etc. They are
climbing or running plants, and provided with tendrils. The flowers
are usually unisexual, sometimes dioecious, but oftener monoecious
(Fig. 123, _I_).

from the disc, x 3. _H_, inflorescence of dandelion (_Taraxacum_), the
flowers all alike, with strap-shaped corollas, x 1. _I_, a single
flower, x 2. _c_, the split, strap-shaped corolla. _J_, two ripe
fruits, still attached to the receptacle (_r_). The pappus is raised
on a long stalk, x 1. _K_, a single fruit, x 2.]

The last and highest order of the _Sympetalae_, and hence of the
dicotyledons, is known as _Aggregatae_, from the tendency to have the
flowers densely crowded into a head, which not infrequently is closely
surrounded by bracts so that the whole inflorescence resembles a
single flower. There are six families, five of which have common
representatives, but the last family (_Calycereae_) has no members
within our limits.

The lower members of the order, _e.g._ various _Rubiaceae_ (Fig. 124,
_A_, _E_), have the flowers in loose inflorescences, but as we examine
the higher families, the tendency for the flowers to become crowded
becomes more and more evident, and in the highest of our native forms
_Dipsaceae_ (Fig. 124, _P_) and _Compositae_ (Fig. 125) this is very
marked indeed. In the latter family, which is by far the largest of
all the angiosperms, including about ten thousand species, the
differentiation is carried still further. Among our native _Compositae_
there are three well-marked types. The first of these may be
represented by the thistles (Fig. 125, _A_). The so-called flower of
the thistle is in reality a close head of small, tubular flowers
(Fig. 125, _C_), each perfect in all respects, having an inferior
one-celled ovary, five stamens with the anthers united, and a
five-parted corolla. The sepals (here called the "pappus") (_p_) have
the form of fine hairs. These little flowers are attached to the
enlarged upper end of the flower stalk (receptacle, _r_), and are
surrounded by closely overlapping bracts or scale leaves which look
like a calyx; the flowers, on superficial examination, appear as
single petals. In other forms like the daisy and may-weed (Fig. 125,
_F_), only the central flowers are perfect, and the edge of the
inflorescence is composed of flowers whose corollas are split and
flattened out, but the stamens and sometimes the pistils are wanting
in these so-called "ray-flowers." In the third group, of which the
dandelion (Fig. 125, _H_), chicory, lettuce, etc., are examples, all
of the flowers have strap-shaped, split corollas, and contain both
stamens and pistils.

The families of the _Aggregatae_ are the following: I. _Rubiaceae_ of
which _Houstonia_ (Fig. 124, _A_), _Galium_ (_E_), _Cephalanthus_
(button-bush), and _Mitchella_ (partridge-berry) are examples;
II. _Caprifoliaceae_, containing the honeysuckles (_Lonicera_)
(Fig. 124, _I_), _Viburnum_ (_G_), snowberry (_Symphoricarpus_), and
elder (_Sambucus_); III. _Valerianeae_, represented by the common
valerian (_Valeriana_) (Fig. 124, _L_); IV. _Dipsaceae_, of which the
teasel (_Dipsacus_) (Fig. 124, _P_), is the type, and also species of
scabious (_Scabiosa_); V. _Compositae_ to which the innumerable,
so-called compound flowers, asters, golden-rods, daisies, sunflowers,
etc. belong; VI. _Calycereae_.

[Illustration: FIG. 126.--_Aristolochiaceae_. _A_, plant of wild ginger
(_Asarum_), x 1/3. _B_, vertical section of the flower, x 1. _C_,
diagram of the flower.]

Besides the groups already mentioned, there are several families of
dicotyledons whose affinities are very doubtful. They are largely
parasitic, _e.g._ mistletoe; or water plants, as the horned pond-weed
(_Ceratophyllum_). One family, the _Aristolochiaceae_, represented by
the curious "Dutchman's pipe" (_Aristolochia sipho_), a woody twiner
with very large leaves, and the common wild ginger (_Asarum_)
(Fig. 126), do not appear to be in any wise parasitic, but the
structure of their curious flowers differs widely from any other group
of plants.




CHAPTER XX.

FERTILIZATION OF FLOWERS.


If we compare the flowers of different plants, we shall find almost
infinite variety in structure, and this variation at first appears to
follow no fixed laws; but as we study the matter more thoroughly, we
find that these variations have a deep significance, and almost
without exception have to do with the fertilization of the flower.

In the simpler flowers, such as those of a grass, sedge, or rush among
the monocotyledons, or an oak, hazel, or plantain, among dicotyledons,
the flowers are extremely inconspicuous and often reduced to the
simplest form. In such plants, the pollen is conveyed from the male
flowers to the female by the wind, and to this end the former are
usually placed above the latter so that these are dusted with the
pollen whenever the plant is shaken by the wind. In these plants, the
male flowers often outnumber the female enormously, and the pollen is
produced in great quantities, and the stigmas are long and often
feathery, so as to catch the pollen readily. This is very beautifully
shown in many grasses.

If, however, we examine the higher groups of flowering plants, we see
that the outer leaves of the flower become more conspicuous, and that
this is often correlated with the development of a sweet fluid
(nectar) in certain parts of the flower, while the wind-fertilized
flowers are destitute of this as well as of odor.

If we watch any bright-colored or sweet-scented flower for any length
of time, we shall hardly fail to observe the visits of insects to it,
in search of pollen or honey, and attracted to the flower by its
bright color or sweet perfume. In its visits from flower to flower,
the insect is almost certain to transfer part of the pollen carried
off from one flower to the stigma of another of the same kind, thus
effecting pollination.

That the fertilization of a flower by pollen from another is
beneficial has been shown by many careful experiments which show that
nearly always--at least in flowers where there are special
contrivances for cross-fertilization--the number of seeds is greater
and the quality better where cross-fertilization has taken place, than
where the flower is fertilized by its own pollen. From these
experiments, as well as from very numerous studies on the structure of
the flower with reference to insect aid in fertilization, we are
justified in the conclusion that all bright-colored flowers are, to a
great extent, dependent upon insect aid for transferring the pollen
from one flower to another, and that many, especially those with
tubular or zygomorphic (bilateral) flowers are perfectly incapable of
self-fertilization. In a few cases snails have been known to be the
conveyers of pollen, and the humming-birds are known in some cases, as
for instance the trumpet-creeper (Fig. 121, _A_), to take the place of
insects.[14]

[14] In a number of plants with showy flowers, _e.g._ violets,
jewel-weed, small, inconspicuous flowers are also formed, which are
self-fertilizing. These inconspicuous flowers are called
"cleistogamous."
