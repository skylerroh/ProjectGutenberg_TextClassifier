
"All right, notice in my article I am writing on chromosomes--chains of
genes, and my field is--?"

"Chain reactions," Collins finished softly, "but--"

"The article itself is well disguised, but it's a parable. It's botany
on the surface, but it gets over enough chain-reaction theory to be good
physics, if you read it right. You see botany is what you might call my
code field."

The bright light of noon shimmered on the white buildings and green
lawns beyond the lab windows. Collins was silent and thoughtful.

"Well, that's about all. Gordon knows. He's in with us, but the
Government doesn't suspect--yet. Oh, they may catch on to us. Information
may leak out to the enemy. There's some chance, but when we're caught
we'll think of something else. Most of us believe it's worth the chance.
There's a risk in anything."

Suddenly all the pieces fell into place, and Collins' anger and confusion
melted away. In its place was a sense of relief and hope, hope for the
future. It wasn't the final answer, but it was a way to keep going. He
was not alone any longer. He had friends who understood, who had been
through what he had been through. It was a good feeling. He heard
Mason's voice again.

"Milt, why don't you do some library work? Botany's my code field. I
don't know what yours is, but you've got some catching up to do. There
may be some interesting stuff published already in your code field."

Collins did, and he developed his new interest enthusiastically. Gordon
had been right. He had been getting stale. Besides, astronomy was a
fascinating field, and suns with their revolving planets in some
respects are very like atomic systems, if you look at it that way.
