_THE BEGINNERS OF A NATION._ A History of the Source and Rise of the
Earliest English Settlements in America, with Special Reference to the
Life and Character of the People. The first volume in A History of Life
in the United States. By EDWARD EGGLESTON. Small 8vo. Cloth, gilt top,
uncut, with Maps, $1.50.

     "Few works on the period which it covers can compare with this in
     point of mere literary attractiveness, and we fancy that many to
     whom its scholarly value will not appeal will read the volume with
     interest and delight."--_New York Evening Post._

     "Written with a firm grasp of the theme, inspired by ample
     knowledge, and made attractive by a vigorous and resonant style,
     the book will receive much attention. It is a great theme the
     author has taken up, and he grasps it with the confidence of a
     master."--_New York Times._

     "Mr. Eggleston's 'Beginners' is unique. No similar historical study
     has, to our knowledge, ever been done in the same way. Mr.
     Eggleston is a reliable reporter of facts; but he is also an
     exceedingly keen critic. He writes history without the effort to
     merge the critic in the historian. His sense of humor is never
     dormant. He renders some of the dullest passages in colonial annals
     actually amusing by his witty treatment of them. He finds a laugh
     for his readers where most of his predecessors have found yawns.
     And with all this he does not sacrifice the dignity of history for
     an instant."--_Boston Saturday Evening Gazette._

     "The delightful style, the clear flow of the narrative, the
     philosophical tone, and the able analysis of men and events will
     commend Mr. Eggleston's work to earnest students."--_Philadelphia
     Public Ledger._

     "The work is worthy of careful reading, not only because of the
     author's ability as a literary artist, but because of his
     conspicuous proficiency in interpreting the causes of and changes
     in American life and character."--_Boston Journal._

     "It is noticeable that Mr. Eggleston has followed no beaten track,
     but has drawn his own conclusions as to the early period, and they
     differ from the generally received version not a little. The book
     is stimulating and will prove of great value to the student of
     history."--_Minneapolis Journal._

     "A very interesting as well as a valuable book.... A distinct
     advance upon most that has been written, particularly of the
     settlement of New England."--_Newark Advertiser._

     "One of the most important books of the year. It is a work of art
     as well as of historical science, and its distinctive purpose is to
     give an insight into the real life and character of people.... The
     author's style is charming, and the history is fully as interesting
     as a novel."--_Brooklyn Standard-Union._

     "The value of Mr. Eggleston's work is in that it is really a
     history of 'life,' not merely a record of events.... The
     comprehensive purpose of his volume has been excellently performed.
     The book is eminently readable."--_Philadelphia Times._

China.

_Travels and Investigations in the "Middle Kingdom"--A Study of its
Civilization and Possibilities._ Together with an Account of the Boxer
War, the Relief of the Legations, and the Re-establishment of Peace. By
JAMES HARRISON WILSON, A.M., LL.D., late Major-General United States
Volunteers, and Brevet Major-General United States Army. Third edition,
revised throughout, enlarged, and reset. 12mo. Cloth, $1.75.

     General Wilson's second visit to China and his recent active
     service in that country have afforded exceptional chances for a
     knowledge of present conditions and the possibilities of the
     future. In the light of the information thus obtained at first hand
     in the country itself, General Wilson is enabled to write with a
     peculiar authoritativeness in this edition, which brings his study
     of China down to the present day. In addition to the new chapters
     which have been added explaining the origin and development of the
     Boxer insurrection, the relief of the legations, and the outlook
     for the future, the author has revised his book throughout, and has
     added much valuable matter in the course of his narrative. This
     book, which is therefore in many respects new, puts the reader in
     possession of a broad and comprehensive knowledge of Chinese
     affairs, and this includes the latest phases of the subject. The
     practical and discriminating character of the author's study of
     China will be appreciated more than ever at this time when
     practical questions relating to Chinese administration, commerce,
     and other matters of the first importance, are engaging so much
     attention. This new edition is indispensable for any one who wishes
     a compact, authoritative presentation of the China of to-day.

The Sun.

By C.A. YOUNG, Ph.D., LL.D., Professor of Astronomy in Princeton
University. New and revised edition, with numerous Illustrations. 12mo.
Cloth, $2.00.

     "'The Sun' is a book of facts and achievements, and not a
     discussion of theories, and it will be read and appreciated by all
     scientific students, and not by them alone. Being written in
     untechnical language, it is equally adapted to a large class of
     educated readers not engaged in scientific pursuits."--_Journal of
     Education, Boston._


The Story of the Sun.

By Sir ROBERT S. BALL, F.R.S., author of "An Atlas of Astronomy," "The
Cause of an Ice Age," etc. 8vo. Cloth, $5.00.

     "Sir Robert Ball has the happy gift of making abstruse problems
     intelligible to the 'wayfaring man' by the aid of simple language
     and a few diagrams. Science moves so fast that there was room for a
     volume which should enlighten the general leader on the present
     state of knowledge about solar phenomena, and that place the
     present treatise admirably fills."--_London Chronicle._


An Atlas of Astronomy.

By Sir ROBERT S. BALL, F.R.S., Professor of Astronomy and Geometry at
the University of Cambridge; author of "Starland," "The Cause of an Ice
Age," etc. With 72 Plates, Explanatory Text, and Complete Index. Small
4to. Cloth, $4.00.

     "The high reputation of Sir Robert Ball as a writer on astronomy at
     once popular and scientific is in itself more than sufficient
     recommendation of his newly published 'Atlas of Astronomy.' ... The
     introduction is written with Sir Robert Ball's well-known lucidity
     and simplicity of exposition, and altogether the Atlas is admirably
     adapted to meet the needs and smooth the difficulties of young and
     inexperienced students of astronomy, as well as materially to
     assist the researches of those that are more advanced."--_London
     Times._


Studies in Spectrum Analysis.

By J. NORMAN LOCKYER, F.R.S., Correspondent of the Institute of France,
etc. With 60 Illustrations. 12mo. Cloth, $2.50.

     "The study of spectrum analysis is one fraught with a peculiar
     fascination, and some of the author's experiments are exceedingly
     picturesque in their results. They are so lucidly described, too,
     that the reader keeps on from page to page, never flagging in
     interest in the matter before him, nor putting down the book until
     the last page is reached."--_New York Evening Express._


The Story of the Stars.

By G.F. CHAMBERS, F.R.A.S., author of "Handbook of Descriptive and
Practical Astronomy," etc. With 24 Illustrations. (Library of Useful
Stories.) 16mo. Cloth, 40 cents.

     "One can here get a clear conception of the relative condition of
     the stars and constellations, and of the existent universe so far
     as it is disclosed to view. The author presents his wonderful and
     at times bewildering facts in a bright and cheery spirit that makes
     the book doubly attractive."--_Boston Home Journal._
