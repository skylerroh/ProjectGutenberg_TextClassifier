In the garage, I continued reading. There was more. Trembling, I read
the next revealing passage:

    _... he put his arm around Julia. Presently she asked him if
    he would remove his arm. He immediately did so, with a smile._

It's not said what was done with the arm after the fellow had removed
it. Maybe it was left standing upright in the corner. Maybe it was
thrown away. I don't care. In any case, the full meaning was there,
staring me right in the face.

Here was a race of creatures capable of removing portions of their
anatomy at will. Eyes, arms--and maybe more. Without batting an
eyelash. My knowledge of biology came in handy, at this point.
Obviously they were simple beings, uni-cellular, some sort of
primitive single-celled things. Beings no more developed than
starfish. Starfish can do the same thing, you know.

I read on. And came to this incredible revelation, tossed off coolly
by the author without the faintest tremor:

    _... outside the movie theater we split up. Part of us went
    inside, part over to the cafe for dinner._

Binary fission, obviously. Splitting in half and forming two entities.
Probably each lower half went to the cafe, it being farther, and the
upper halves to the movies. I read on, hands shaking. I had really
stumbled onto something here. My mind reeled as I made out this
passage:

    _... I'm afraid there's no doubt about it. Poor Bibney has
    lost his head again._

Which was followed by:

    _... and Bob says he has utterly no guts._

Yet Bibney got around as well as the next person. The next person,
however, was just as strange. He was soon described as:

    _... totally lacking in brains._

       *       *       *       *       *

There was no doubt of the thing in the next passage. Julia, whom I had
thought to be the one normal person, reveals herself as also being an
alien life form, similar to the rest:

    _... quite deliberately, Julia had given her heart to the
    young man._

It didn't relate what the final disposition of the organ was, but I
didn't really care. It was evident Julia had gone right on living in
