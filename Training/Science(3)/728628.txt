
The horde of rat-men rallied and swept on forward in a wave that
nothing could have stopped this time--but their charge was too late.
The entire rocky projection collapsed with a final sickening lurch,
and slid to the pit's floor, carrying Joan and Powell with it in a
miniature avalanche of rocky rubble.

       *       *       *       *       *

Even in the chaos of their wild descent, Powell retained his grip
upon the loaded automatic in his hand. They struck the bottom and
staggered half-dazed to their feet, to confront the two crystalline
monsters rocking on their rounded bases scarcely ten feet away.

The fatal cone-shaped projection was already beginning to form upon
the silver-faceted side of the nearest Devil Crystal. Before the
lance-like arm of crystal could flash outward, Powell sent two
bullets crashing into the crystal's side just over the opalescent
nucleus.

The leaden missiles caromed harmlessly off, as though they had
struck armor-plate, but the nucleus clouded momentarily and the
cone-shaped projection dissolved back into the side.

With lightning speed Powell shifted his aim to the other crystal
just as its partly-formed arm was flashing toward them. His bullet
crashed into the silvery side squarely over the nucleus. Again the
bullet's effect was the same. This crystal nucleus clouded murkily,
and the lance-like arm telescoped back into the faceted bulk.

But the effect of the bullets was only momentary. Swiftly the nuclei
of both crystals cleared. A deep blue film, apparently protective in
nature, formed between the outer wall and each nucleus. The cones
budded, and again the arms started forth.

Powell fired again, and this time uselessly. His bullet struck
squarely, but the shock of its impact was apparently nullified by
the protective blue film. He emptied his gun in a last crashing
fusillade, but without effect of any kind upon the film-guarded
nuclei of the giant crystals.

Their forming arms never wavered as they came lancing forward with
deadly accuracy straight toward Joan and Powell. In a last effort to
save Joan from the terrible doom of the crystal lances as long as
possible, Powell flung his own body as a shield in front of the
half-fainting girl. The tip of one of the crystalline arms struck
his chest with a crashing tinkle of musical glass.

Instantly the tip sprayed into a web of fine filaments that laced on
around his body. A tinkling shock raced through his every nerve from
the contact with the weird life force of the great crystal.

The arm began contracting. Powell was helpless against the terrific
power of the slender, diamond-hard lance of crystal. He felt himself
irresistibly drawn toward the silver-faceted wall of the Devil
Crystal.

His senses reeled in the babel of alien sounds--the crashing,
glass-like music of the crystalline monsters and the snarling,
squealing, paean of jubilant triumph from the thousands of rat-men
now lining the rim of the pit above.

       *       *       *       *       *

Then suddenly the pit, the Devil Crystals, and everything else in
the nightmare world of Arret was blotted out in a vast swirling
cloud of pulsing roseate flame that seemed to sweep him bodily up
into the air and whirl him dizzily around.

His dazed brain staggered from the shock of the cataclysmic force
that was disintegrating an entire world around him, but through the
utter chaos one thought rang clear and exultant in his consciousness.

Benjamin Marlowe had finally broadcast the recall wave!

For what seemed endless eons of time Powell hurried through a
limitless universe of swirling, tinted fires, while vibrations of a
mighty force tingled with poignant ecstasy in every atom of his
body.

Then the eddying clouds of flame began to coalesce and solidify with
startling suddenness. A moment later, like the abrupt lighting of a
room when an electric switch is snapped, the mists vanished and
Powell felt firm footing again under his feet. Around him were the
familiar objects of Benjamin Marlowe's laboratory.

He was standing upon the floor-plate in the center of the area
bounded by the banked green tubes, and beside him stood Joan,
sobbing with relief at their last-minute rescue from the Devil
Crystals of Arret. And over by the control panel of the recall
mechanism was the slight figure of old Benjamin Marlowe, with a
great joy now shining in his faded eyes.
