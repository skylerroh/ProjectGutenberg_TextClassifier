
The heat generated in the furnace is utilized to the utmost, and the
escaping vapors form a steam jacket in the double casing of the
disinfecting chamber. The method of manipulation reduces the danger of
contagion to a minimum, as the clothes or bedding are placed in
specially constructed sacks in the sick chamber itself, and, after
being tightly closed, the sacks are removed and hung in the
disinfector. The stationary apparatus, which is constructed to
disinfect four complete suits of clothes, including underlinen, or one
complete set of bedding, including mattress, is specially adapted for
hospitals, barracks, jails, etc. Its dimensions can easily be
increased, but the size shown has proved itself, from an economical
point of view, the best, as, where the quantity of articles to be
disinfected varies, several apparatus can be erected at a less cost
than one large one, and one or more be heated as the quantity of
infected articles be small or large. In the accompanying drawing A is
the boiler, which is filled by pouring water into the reservoir, B,
until the same, entering the boiler at its lowest part through the
tube, C, rises to the desired height in the water gauge, G. C acts
also in the place of a safety valve. D is the fire space, E a movable
grate, and F the coal hopper. The fuel consists of charcoal or coke.
The boiler is emptied by the cock, H. I is a steam pipe connecting the
steam space with the hot air tube, L¹. K is an auxiliary pipe to admit
the steam into the chimney during stoppage for emptying and recharging
the disinfecting chamber in continuous working. The admission of air
is regulated by the handle, L, and the draught in the chimney, M, by
the handle, N. O is the disinfecting chamber inclosed by the space, P,
which acts at the same time as a steam jacket and as a channel for
the downward passage of the vapors escaping from the chamber through
the outlets, S. The lower portion of the disinfecting chamber, Q, is
funnel-shaped for the better mixture and distribution of the steam and
hot air, and to collect any condensation water. Q¹ is a sieve to catch
any fallen article. The vertical tubes, S, which serve at the same
time to strengthen the chamber, connect the lower portion of the steam
jacket, P, with the circular channel, T, which is again connected with
the chimney, M, by the tube, T'. The disinfection chamber is
hermetically closed by the double cover, R, to the lower plate of
which hooks for hanging the sacks are fastened. The cover fits in a
sand bath, and is raised and lowered by means of the pulley chain, W,
and the swinging crane, X. U is a thermometer indicating the
temperature of the steam and hot air in the disinfecting chamber, V a
cock for drawing off any condensation water, Y a battery connected
with an electrical thermometer to be placed in the clothes or bedding,
and Z the sacks in which the infected articles are hung.

The portable apparatus, as shown, for heating with gas, or even
spirits of wine, can also be heated with a similar steam and hot air
apparatus as the stationary disinfector. In country towns or villages,
or even in cities, whose architectural arrangements permit, the
portable disinfector can easily be drawn by one man into the courtyard
or garden of any house, and the process of disinfection conducted on
the spot. Its usefulness in campaigns for ambulance hospitals is
self-evident. The letters denoting the several parts are the same as
in the stationary apparatus. The portable disinfector is constructed
to disinfect two complete suits of clothes or one mattress. The
extremely favorable results are shown in the accompanying table of
trials.--_The Engineer._

N.B.--In every case, even in the trials V. and X., in which the
temperature in the disinfecting chamber rose above 320 deg. Fah., the
clothes, owing to the complete saturation of the hot air with live
steam, remained absolutely unimpaired.

The column "water evaporated" shows the quantity of live steam passing
through the disinfecting chamber averages 13 cubic feet per minute
with gas or spirits, and 22 cubic feet with charcoal or coke in the
portable and 33 cubic feet in the stationary apparatus. Trials VI.,
VII., and VIII. took place in open air.

According to trial XII., from 28 to 30 complete suits of clothes can
be disinfected at an expenditure of about 75 cbs. of coke per diem.

DRAWING INSTRUMENT FOR ACCURATE WORK.

BY J. LEHRKE.


This arrangement consists in a cylindrical metal or horn mounted lens
two to four centimeters long, and magnifying two or three times, and
two or three centimeters in diameter, whose side is provided with a
contrivance for holding after it has been pushed into place a copying
needle, a protractor, etc.

While hitherto the architect in using millimeter paper must hold
separately in his hands a magnifying glass and needle, while the
engraver holds the engraving tool inclined in one hand and the
magnifying glass in the other, or must work under a large lens
standing on three feet, it is now possible by a firm connection
between the lens and needle or other instrument to draw directly with
one hand and under the lens. In the accompanying cut one of these
lenses is shown in section, A, in which the glass is set obliquely, in
whose focus the needle, _a_, is held and the field of view is
enlarged. A longer description is unnecessary, as the illustration
gives the best explanation. It need only be remarked that the stud,
_s_, projecting a little near the glass, is for the purpose of
preventing the instrument from leaving the position coinciding with
the plane of the drawing. For architects and engineers is provided a
small compass, _b_, of about 2 cm. diameter, for laying off parallel
widths, for making smaller scales and the like. In these cases it is
substituted for the needle. In like manner for calculating cross
profiles by graphical methods, for reading parallel divisions, for
estimating areas, or revising maps, a finely divided prismatic ivory
rule, _c_, can be placed under the glass, B, and will do good service.
In this case the plane of the lens must be perpendicular to the axis
of the tube.

[Illustration: IMPROVED DRAWING INSTRUMENT.]

For draughtsmen a parallel drawing pen, something like _b_, is used,
which gives several lines at once, perfectly parallel and close
together; or a drawing pen with which the smallest signatures, such as
boundary stones and figures, can be made neatly and exactly, which is
secured like the needle, _a_, and for which the cylinder serves also
as pen holder, offers a great advance.

Thus a whole series of instruments can be used with the lens. For
instance, a naturalist can use with it a knife or other instrument. To
avoid injury from the instruments, one should, in laying down the
cylinder, place it on its side. It is also recommended that on the
outer tube of the frame, which is appropriately lacquered of black
color, white arrows should be placed in the direction of the points of
the instrument, so that the eyes shall be protected from injury in
handling the instrument, as by the points being stuck into the pupil,
owing to lifting the instrument in an inverted position.--_Zeitschrift
fur Instrumentenkunde._

BARLOW'S MACHINE FOR MOULDING CANDLES.


That style of machine for moulding candles in which the candles are
forced out at the top by means of a piston is the one most employed,
and it is an apparatus of this kind that we illustrate herewith. In
its construction, this apparatus presents some important improvements
in detail which it is of interest to set forth. The improvements made
by the Messrs. Barlow have been studied with a view of manufacturing
candles with conical ends, adapted to all chandeliers, without
interfering with rapidity of production or increasing the net cost.

These gentlemen have likewise so simplified the continuous system of
drawing the wick along as to prevent any loss of cotton. In the next
place, the structure of the moulds, properly so called, is new.
Instead of being cast, as is usually the case, they are rolled and
drawn out, thus giving them smooth surfaces and permitting of their
being soldered, are assembled by means of threaded bronze sockets. The
engravings between Figs. 3 and 4 show these two modes of fixation. At
_a_ may be seen the old method of junction by soldering, and at _b_
the screwing of the moulds into the socket. This machine consists of a
box which is alternately heated and cooled, and which is fixed upon a
frame, A, at the lower part of which are located the wick bobbins, E.
Toward the top of the machine there is a mechanism for actuating the
two pairs of jaws, B, which grasp the candles forced upward by the
play of the pistons, D. This mechanism, which is controlled by a
lever, acts by means of an eccentric.

[Illustration: Figs. 1 and 2. BARLOW'S CANDLE MOULDING MACHINE.]

The pistons, D, are hollow, and are provided above with pieces which
form the small end of the candles. Instead of using tin, as is usually
done, the Messrs. Barlow employ galvanized iron in the construction of
these pistons, and mount them through screw rings--no soldering being
used. For this reason, any workman whatever can quickly replace one of
the tubes. All the pistons are placed upon a horizontal table, which
is made to rise and descend at will, in order to regulate the length
of the candles and remove them from the mould. A winch transmits the
motion which is communicated to it to two pairs of pinions that gear
with racks fixed to the frame to lift the table that supports the
pistons. How these latter are mounted may be seen from an inspection
of Figs. 3 to 5. This new arrangement of spiral springs for the
purpose is designed to hold the pistons on the table firmly, and at
the same time to prevent the shock that their upper ends might undergo
in case of an abrupt turn of the winch. Moreover, the forged iron
plate, H, is not exposed to breakage as it is in other machines, where
it is of cast iron. The bobbins already mentioned revolve upon strong
iron rods, and the moving forward of the wick in the moulds is
effected automatically by the very fact of the manufactured candles'
being forced out. These latter are held in position through the double
play of the jaws, B, while the stearic acid is flowing into the upper
part of the moulds. The cotton wick is thus drawn along and kept in
the axis of the candles.

[Illustration: Figs. 3, 4, 5. BARLOW'S CANDLE MOULDING MACHINE.]

One peculiarity of the machine consists in the waste system applied to
the mould box. Steam or hot or cold water is sent into the latter
through the conduit, L, starting from a junction between pipes
provided with cocks. When the water contained in the box is in excess,
it flows out through the waste pipes, G, which terminate in a single
conduit. Owing to the branchings at T, and to the cocks of the
conduits that converge at L, it is very easy to vary the temperature
of the box at will. The warm or cold water or steam may be admitted or
shut off simultaneously.

When first beginning operations, the wick is introduced into each
mould by hand. The piston table is raised by means of the winch, and
is held in this position through the engaging of a click with a
ratchet on the windlass. A fine iron rod long enough to reach beneath
the pistons and catch the end of the wick is next introduced. After
this is removed, the wick is fixed once for all, and in any way
whatever, to the top of the mould. This operation having been
accomplished, the piston table is lowered, and the machine is ready to
receive the stearic acid. The moulds are of tin and are open at both
ends. In order to facilitate the removal of the candles, they are made
slightly conical. When the candles have hardened, the ends are
equalized with a wooden or tin spatula, and then the piston table is
raised. At this instant, the jaws, B, are closed so as to hold the
candles in place. The latter, in rising, pull into the mould a new
length of wick, well centered. A slight downward tension is exerted
upon the wick by hand, then a new operation is begun. During this
time, the candles held between the jaws having become hard, their
wicks are now cut by means of the levers, C, and they are removed from
the machine and submitted to a finishing process.--_Revue
Industrielle._

A NEW ALKALI PROCESS.


In several former notes and articles in these pages, we have spoken of
the severe crisis through which the old established, or "Leblanc,"
process has now for some years been passing. It is, in fact, pushed
well nigh out of the running by the newer process, known as the
"ammonia-soda" process, and would have had to give up the battle
before now were it not for the fact that one of its by-products,
bleaching powder, cannot, so far, be produced at all by the
ammonia-soda works. The bleaching powder trade has thus remained in
the hands of the workers of the Leblanc process, and its sale has
enabled them to cover much of the loss which they are suffering on the
manufacture of soda ash and caustic soda.

In brief outline, the old Leblanc process consists in the following
operations: Salt is decomposed and boiled down with sulphuric acid.
Sulphate of sodium is formed, and a large amount of hydrochloric acid
is given off. This is condensed, and is utilized in the manufacture of
the bleaching powder mentioned above. The sulphate of sodium, known as
"salt cake," is mixed with certain proportions of small coal and
limestone, and subjected to a further treatment in a furnace, by which
a set of reactions take place, causing the conversion of the sulphate
of sodium of the "salt cake" into carbonate of sodium, a quantity of
sulphide of calcium being produced at the same time. The mass
resulting from this process is known as "black ash." It is extracted
with water, which dissolves out the carbonate of sodium, which is sold
as such or worked into "caustic" soda, as may be required. The
insoluble residue is the "alkali waste," which forms the vast piles,
so hideous to look at and so dreadful to smell, which surround our
large alkali works.

The sulphuric acid required for the conversion of the salt into "salt
cake" is made by the alkali manufacturer himself, this manufacture
necessitating a large plant of "lead chambers" and accessories, and
keeping up an immense trade in pyrites from Spain and Portugal. The
development of the alkali trade in this country has been something
colossal, and the interests involved in it and connected with it are
so great that anything affecting it may safely be said to be of truly
national importance, quite apart from what technical interest it may
possess.

The "ammonia-soda" process, which has played such havoc with the old
style of manufacture, proceeds on totally different lines. Briefly
stated, it depends on the fact that if a solution of salt in water is
mixed with bicarbonate of ammonium, under proper conditions, a
reaction takes place by which the salt, or chloride of sodium, is
converted at once into bicarbonate of sodium, the bicarbonate of
ammonium being at the same time converted into chloride of ammonium.

The bicarbonate of sodium settles out at once as insoluble crystals,
easily removed, marketable at once as such, or easily converted into
simple carbonate of sodium, and further into caustic soda, as in the
ordinary "old" process. The residual chloride of ammonium is
decomposed by distillation with lime, giving ammonia for reconversion
into bicarbonate of ammonium, and chloride of calcium, which is a
waste product.

The maker of "ammonia" soda works direct on the brine, as pumped from
the salt fields. His plant is simpler and less costly, and he arrives
at his first marketable product much more rapidly and with very much
lower working costs than the maker of Leblanc soda, in spite of all
the great mechanical improvements which have of late years been
introduced into the old process, and which have cheapened its work.

The original patents on the use of ammonium bicarbonate have, we
understand, long since expired. But the working details of the process
and much of the most successful apparatus have undergone great
development and improvement during late years, all the important
points being covered by patents still in force, and mainly, if not
wholly, in the hands of the one large firm which is now carrying on
the manufacture in this country, and is controlling the market.

The one weak spot of the ammonia-soda process, as we mentioned before,
is its inability to supply hydrochloric acid or chlorine, and so allow
of making bleaching powder. Time after time it has been announced
positively that the problem was solved, that the ammonia-soda makers
had devised a method of producing hydrochloric acid or chlorine, or
both, without the use of sulphuric acid. But the announcements have so
far proved baseless, and at present the Leblanc makers are getting
incredulous, and do not much excite themselves over new statements of
the kind, though they know that if once their rivals had this weapon
in their hands the battle would be over and the Leblanc process doomed
to rapid extinction.

Such is at present the state of the struggle in this great industry,
and the above outline sketch of the two processes is designed to give
some idea of the conditions to such of our readers as may not have any
special knowledge of these manufactures.

At the present moment great interest is being taken in a new process,
about to be put to work on a large scale, which is designed to take up
the cudgels against the ammonia process and enable the Leblanc makers
to continue the fight on something more like equal terms.

We allude to the process proposed and patented by Messrs. Parnell &
Simpson, and about to be worked by the "Lancashire Alkali and Sulphur
Company," at Widnes. We recently had the opportunity of inspecting
fully the plant erected, and of having the method of procedure
explained to us. We look upon the new process as such a spirited
attempt to turn the tide of a long and losing battle, and as so very
interesting on its own merits, that an account of it in these pages
will be thoroughly in place.

The main idea of the process is to combine the "Leblanc" and the
"ammonia-soda" manufacture. But in place of using caustic lime to
decompose the ammonium chloride and get back the ammonia, the "alkali
waste" spoken of above is employed, it being found that not only is
the ammonia driven off, but that also the sulphur in the "waste" is
obtained in a form allowing of its easy utilization, it and the
ammonia combining to form ammonium sulphide, which passes over in
gaseous form from the decomposing apparatus. This ammonium sulphide
is, as we shall see, quite as available for the working of the
ammonia-soda manufacture as pure and simple ammonia, and all the
sulphur can be obtained from it.

In outline the process is as follows: We will suppose that a quantity
of bicarbonate of sodium has been just precipitated from a brine
solution, and we have the residual ammonium chloride to deal with.
This is decomposed by "alkali waste," giving a final liquor of calcium
chloride, which is run to waste, and a quantity of ammonium sulphide
gas. This latter is led at once into a solution of salt in water, till
saturation takes place. Into this liquor of brine and ammonium
sulphide _pure_ carbonic acid gas is now passed. The ammonium sulphide
is decomposed, pure sulphureted hydrogen gas is given off, which is
conducted to a gas holder and stored, while ammonium bicarbonate is
formed in the liquor, which brings about the conversion of the salt
into bicarbonate of sodium, ready for removal and preparation for the
market.

It will be observed that we printed the word _pure_ in italics in
speaking of the carbonic acid used. This is one of the great points in
the process, as in order that the sulphureted hydrogen gas obtained
shall be concentrated and pure, only pure carbonic acid can be used in
liberating it. The apparatus employed in its preparation is perhaps
the most ingenious part of the works, and well worthy of attention by
others besides alkali makers. The method is based on the fact that if
dilute impure carbonic acid is passed into a solution of carbonate of
sodium, the carbonic acid is absorbed, bicarbonate of sodium being
formed, and the diluting gases passing away.

The bicarbonate of sodium on heating gives up the extra carbonic acid,
which can be collected and stored pure, while the liquor passes back
to simple carbonate of sodium, to be used over again as an absorbent.
This is not at all new in theory, of course, nor is this the first
