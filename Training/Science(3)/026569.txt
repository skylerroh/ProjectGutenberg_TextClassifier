  Under the cloud of cast-off identities
    lay the shape of another man--
      was it himself?

He was walking endlessly down a long, glass-walled corridor. Bright
sunlight slanted in through one wall, on the blue knapsack across his
shoulders. Who he was, and what he was doing here, was clouded. The
truth lurked in some corner of his consciousness, but it was not reached
by surface awareness.

The corridor opened at last into a large high-domed room, much like a
railway station or an air terminal. He walked straight ahead.

At the sight of him a man leaning negligently against a stone pillar, to
his right but within vision, straightened and barked an order to him,
"Halt!" He lengthened his stride but gave no other sign.

Two men hurried through a doorway of a small anteroom to his left,
calling to him. He turned away and began to run.

Shouts and the sound of charging feet came from behind him. He cut to

There was nothing to do after that--except wait.

The men pursuing him came hurtling around the turn in the aisle. He
kicked his knapsack to one side, spreading his feet wide with an
instinctive motion.

Until that instant he had intended to fight. Now he swiftly reassessed
the odds. There were five of them, he saw. He should be able to
incapacitate two or three and break out. But the fact that they had been
expecting him meant that others would very probably be waiting outside.
His best course now was to sham ignorance. He relaxed.

He offered no resistance as they reached him.

They were not gentle men. A tall ruffian, copper-brown face damp with
