An opera-glass will reveal many of its beauties.

Herschel counted 331,000 stars in an area of only 5[deg] in Cygnus.

AQUILA (ak'-wi-l[:a])--THE EAGLE, AND ANTINO[:U]S. (Face Southeast.)


LOCATION.--Half-way up the sky in the Milky Way, you will see three
stars in a line, the middle one much brighter than the other two. This
bright star is Altair, in Aquila. It forms with Vega and Deneb an
isosceles triangle. Altair is at the apex, about 35[deg] from the other
two. A triangle is formed by Vega, Altair, and Ras Alhague, in the
Serpent Bearer, which is about 30[deg] west of Altair.

This is a double constellation composed of Aquila and Antino[:u]s. Altair
is in the neck of the Eagle, Alschain in the head of Antino[:u]s.

When the moon is absent, a rude arrowhead can be traced out, embracing
almost all the stars in Aquila.

[[^e]] is an interesting variable star, changing from magnitude 3.5 to
4.7 and back again within a period of 7 days 4 hours 12 minutes.

Altair rises about 8[deg] north of the exact eastern point on the horizon.

In A.D. 389 a wonderful temporary star flashed out near Altair that
equalled Venus in brightness and vanished within three weeks' time.

ANTINO[:U]S]




DELPHINUS (del-fi'-nus)--THE DOLPHIN, OR JOB'S COFFIN. (Face
Southeast.)


LOCATION.--The little cluster of five stars forming Delphinus is to be
seen about 10[deg] northeast of Altair, and, though there are no bright
stars in the group, it can hardly escape notice. A line drawn from
Vega to Albireo, and prolonged about 20[deg], strikes the star [e] in the
tail of the Dolphin. The four other stars of prominence in the
constellation are a little above [e], and form a diamond-shaped
figure.

The little asterisms Sagitta, the Arrow, and Vulpecula and Anser, the
Fox and Goose, are shown just above Delphinus.

Delphinus is also called Job's Coffin. The origin of this appellation
is unknown.

In Greece, Delphinus was the Sacred Fish, the sky emblem of
philanthropy. The Arabs called it the "Riding Camel."

The star [g] Delphini is a fine double for a small telescope with a
marked and beautiful contrast of colors.

The names for [a] and [b] reversed spell "Nicolaus Venator," the
Latinized name of the assistant to the astronomer Piazzi.

[Illustration: DELPHINUS]




SAGITTARIUS (saj-i-t[=a]-ri-us)--THE ARCHER. (Face South.)


LOCATION.--A line drawn from Deneb, in Cygnus, to Altair, in Aquila,
and prolonged an equal distance, terminates in Sagittarius about 10[deg]
east of its distinguishing characteristic, the Milk Dipper.
Sagittarius is one of the signs of the zodiac, and lies between
Capricornus, on the east, and Scorpius, on the west.

The bow is easily traced out. [g] marks the arrow's tip.

Note the star [m], which serves to point out the Winter Solstice,
where the solstitial colure intersects the ecliptic.

On a clear night, the pretty cluster known as Corona Australis, the
Southern Crown, can be seen about 10[deg] below the bowl of the Milk
Dipper. Its lucida, the fourth-magnitude star Alfecca Meridiana
culminates at 9 P.M., August 13th.

Sagittarius is about due south, in a splendid position for
observation, during the month of July, between the hours of
nine-thirty and eleven o'clock P.M.

Observe with an opera-glass the fine clusters 20 M. and 8 M., also an
almost circular black void near the stars [g] and [d], and to the east
of this spot another of narrow crescent form.

The stars [ph] and [z] in the Milk Dipper are moving in opposite
directions. Future generations therefore will not have this
time-honored figure to guide them in locating the Archer in their
summer night skies.

[Illustration: SAGITTARIUS]




OPHIUCHUS (of-i-[=u]-kus)--THE SERPENT BEARER, AND SERPENS. (Face
Southwest.)


LOCATION.--A line drawn from [e] Delphini to [g] Aquilae, prolonged
about 30[deg], strikes the star Ras Alhague, the brightest star in the
constellation and the head of Ophiuchus. It is at one angle of an
isosceles triangle, of which Altair is at the apex, and Vega the third
angle.

Two constellations are here combined. Ophiuchus is represented as an
old man, holding in his hands a writhing serpent.

Ras Algethi, marking the head of Hercules, lies just west of Ras
Alhague.

Equally distant southeast and southwest of Ras Alhague are to be seen
two stars close together, representing the shoulders of Ophiuchus. His
foot rests on the Scorpion just above Antares.

The head of Serpens is the star group in the form of an "X" just below
the Crown.

1604 indicates the spot where in that year a famous temporary star
appeared, called Kepler's star.

Note the asterism the "Bull of Poniatowski" just east of [g]. The star
marked 70 is one of the most distant stars for which a parallax has
been obtained. Its distance from the earth = 1,300,000 radii of the
earth's orbit, or 120 quadrillion miles.

There is something remarkable in the central position of this gigantic
figure. It is situated almost exactly in the mid-heavens, being nearly
equidistant from the poles, and midway between the vernal and autumnal
equinoxes.

[Illustration: OPHIUCHUS

SERPENS]




SCORPIUS (sk[^o]r'-pi-us)--THE SCORPION. (Face South.)


LOCATION.--Scorpius, one of the signs of the zodiac, is a beautiful
star group, and one that is easily traced out. It lies just under the
Serpent Bearer, between Sagittarius and Libra.

The resemblance to a Scorpion is not difficult to see, hence this
constellation is perhaps the most aptly named of any.

The ruddy star Antares, the brightest star in the constellation, is in
the heart of the Scorpion. It lies about 40[deg] southwest of Ras Alhague,
in Ophiuchus, and a little over 20[deg] west of the bow of Sagittarius.
The fact that it is the most brilliant star in this region of the sky
renders its identity unmistakable. It is one of the reddest stars in
the firmament.

There are several star clusters and double stars to be seen in this
constellation. Their position is indicated in the diagram.

The curved tail of the Scorpion is very conspicuous. [l] and [y] are a
striking pair and the fine clusters above them can be seen with the
naked eye.

A record of a lunar occultation of [b] Scorpii in 295 B.C. is extant.

Note a pair just below [b]. They are known as [[^o]]^1 and [[^o]]^2.

In this region of the sky have appeared many of the brilliant
temporary stars, the first one in astronomical annals being discovered
in 134 B.C.

Scorpius is mentioned by all the early writers on astronomy and is
supposed to be so named because in Egypt it was a sickly time of the
year when the sun entered this sign.

[Illustration: SCORPIUS]




LIBRA (l[=i]'-bra)--THE SCALES. (Face Southwest.)


LOCATION.--Libra is one of the signs of the zodiac, and lies between
Virgo and Scorpius. Its two chief stars, [a] and [b], may be
recognized west of and above the head of the Scorpion.

The star [i] Librae is about 20[deg] northwest of Antares in the Scorpion.
Spica in Virgo, a star of the first magnitude, is a little over 20[deg]
northwest of [a] Librae.

A quadrilateral is formed by the stars [a], [b], [g], [e], which
characterizes the constellation.

The star [a] Librae looks elongated. An opera-glass shows that it has a
fifth-magnitude companion.

[b] is a pale green star. Its color is very unusual.

Lyra, Corona, and Hercules are almost directly overhead in the early
evening, during July and August, and can best be observed in a
reclining position. Thus placed, with an opera-glass to assist the
vision, you may study to the best advantage the wonderful sight spread
out before you, and search depths only measured by the power of your
glass.

When the sun enters the sign Libra the days and nights are equal all
over the world and seem to observe a certain equilibrium like a
balance, hence the name of the constellation.

[Illustration: LIBRA]




CORONA BOREALIS (k[=o]-r[=o]'n[:a] b[=o]-r[=e]-a'-lis)--THE NORTHERN
CROWN.


LOCATION.--A line drawn from [a] Cygni, to [a] Lyrae, and projected a
little over 40[deg], terminates in the Crown, which lies between Hercules
and Bo[:o]tes, and just above the diamond-shaped group of stars in the
head of the Serpent.

The characteristic semicircle resembling a crown is easily traced out.
The principal stars are of the fourth magnitude excepting Gemma, which
is a second-magnitude star and known as the "Pearl of the Crown."

Gemma, sometimes called Alphacca, forms with the stars Seginus and
Arcturus, in Bo[:o]tes, an isosceles triangle, the vertex of which is at
Arcturus.

Close to [e] a famous temporary appeared suddenly May 12, 1866, as a
second-magnitude star. It was known as the "Blaze Star" and was
visible to the naked eye only eight days, fading at that time to a
tenth-magnitude star, and then rising to an eighth-magnitude, where it
still remains.

The native Australians called this constellation "The Boomerang." To
the Hebrews it was "Ataroth" and by this name it is known in the East
to-day. No two of the seven stars composing the Crown are moving in
the same direction or at the same rate.

[a] Coronae is seventy-eight light years distant and sixty times
brighter than the sun.

[Illustration: CORONA BOREALIS]




HERCULES (her'-k[=u]-l[=e]z)--THE KNEELER.


LOCATION.--A line drawn from either Vega, in Lyra, or Altair, in
Aquila, to Gemma, in Corona Borealis, passes through this
constellation. The left foot of Hercules rests on the head of Draco,
on the north, and his head nearly touches the head of Ophiuchus on the
south.

The star in the head of Hercules, Ras Algethi, is about 25[deg] southeast
of Corona Borealis.

[a] Ophiuchi and [a] Herculis are only about 5[deg] apart.

The cluster 13 M., the Halley Nebula, can be easily seen in an
opera-glass. In a recent photograph of this cluster 50,000 stars are
shown in an area of sky which would be entirely covered by the full
moon.

Hercules occupies the part of the heavens toward which the sun is
bearing the earth and planets at the rate of twelve miles a second or
373 million miles a year.

On a clear night the asterism Cerberus, the three-headed dog, which
Hercules holds in his hand, can be seen.

This constellation is said to have been an object of worship in
Phoenicia. There is a good deal of mystery about its origin. The
ancient Greeks called it "The Phantom" and "The Man upon his Knees."

The stars [e], [z], [[^e]], and [p] form a keystone shaped figure that
serves to identify the constellation.

[Illustration: HERCULES]




BO[:O]TES (b[=o]-[=o]'t[=e]z)--THE HERDSMAN, OR BEAR DRIVER. (Face West.)


LOCATION.--Bo[:o]tes lies just west of the Crown, and east of Cor Caroli.
It may be easily distinguished by the position and splendor of its
principal star, Arcturus, which shines with a golden yellow lustre. It
is about 35[deg] east of Denebola, in Leo, and nearly as far north of
Spica, in Virgo, and forms with these two a large equilateral
triangle. A line drawn from [z] to [[^e]] Ursae Majoris and prolonged
about 30[deg] locates it, as does one from [d] Herculis to [g] Coronae
prolonged its length.

The brightest stars in Bo[:o]tes outline a characteristic kite-shaped
figure. Arcturus is mentioned in the Book of Job and is often referred
to as "The Star of Job."

Three stars of the fourth magnitude are situated in the right hand.
They are about 5[deg] north of [[^e]] Ursae Majoris.

Contrast the color of Arcturus with Spica, Antares, and Vega.

The trapezium [b], [g], [d], and [m], was called "The Female Wolves,"
by the Arabians; [th], [i], [k] and [l], "The Whelps of the Hyenas."
They knew the constellation as "The Vociferator."

Arcturus is the fourth brightest star in the northern hemisphere. It
is 1000 times the size of our sun and rushes through space toward
Virgo at the astounding rate of ninety miles a second. It is forty
light years distant.

The ancient Greeks called this constellation "Lycaon," a name which
signifies a Wolf. The Hebrew name for it was "The Barking Dog."

[Illustration: BO[:O]TES]




VIRGO (ver'-g[=o])--THE VIRGIN. (Face West.)


LOCATION.--An imaginary line drawn from Antares in Scorpius through
[a] Librae and prolonged a little over 20[deg] strikes Spica, the brightest
star in Virgo, which star is about 30[deg] southwest of Arcturus.

Arcturus, Cor Caroli, Denebola, and Spica form a figure about 50[deg] in
length, called the Diamond of Virgo.

The equator, ecliptic, and equinoctial colure intersect each other at
a point close to the star [[^e]]. This is called the autumnal equinox.

The star [e] is known as the "Grape Gatherer." It is observed to rise
just before the sun at vintage time.

Within the rude square formed by Denebola, and [e], [g], and [b],
Virginis, the telescope reveals many wonderful nebulae; hence this
region of the sky has been called "The Field of the Nebula."

Spica is an extremely beautiful pure white star. It rises a very
little south of the exact eastern point on the horizon.

[g] is a fine double star for a small telescope.

Virgo is mentioned by the astronomers of all ages. By the Egyptians it
was intended to represent the goddess Isis, and the Greeks knew it as
Ceres. Spica represents the ear of corn held in the Virgin's left
hand.

[Illustration: VIRGO]




CANES VENATICI (k[=a]'-n[=e]z ve-nat'-i-c[=i])--THE HUNTING DOGS.
(Face Northwest.)


LOCATION.--Cor Caroli, the bright star in this constellation, when on
the meridian is about 17[deg] south of [e] Ursae Majoris. A line drawn from
[[^e]] Ursae Majoris, through Berenice's Hair, to Denebola, in Leo, passes
through it.

The dogs, Asterion and Chara, are represented as being held in leash
by Bo[:o]tes, the herdsman, in his pursuit of the Great Bear.

Cor Caroli is in the southern hound, Chara, and represents the heart
of Charles II of England. It is a beautiful double star in a small
telescope.

The so-called "Diamond of Virgo," is clearly shown on this plate. It
is formed by connecting with lines the stars Cor Caroli, Denebola,
Spica, and Arcturus.

The fifth-magnitude star La Superba, about 7[deg] north and 2-1/2[deg]
west of Cor Caroli, is especially noteworthy because of the flashing
brilliancy of its prismatic rays.

The Perseids are of a yellowish color, and move with medium velocity.
Their line of flight is from northeast to southwest. They are probably
visible for more than a month, from the latter half of July to the
last week in August.

The August meteors are known as the "Tears of St. Lawrence."

The Abbreviations under _Characteristics_ are as follows:
