The Stowaway

By Alvin Heiner


 _He stole a ride to the Moon in search of
 glory, but found a far different destiny._


His eyes were a little feverish--as they had been of late--and his voice
held a continuous intensity--as though he were imparting a secret. "I've
got to get on that ship! I've got to, I tell you! And I'm going to make
it!"

Different members of the group regarded him variously, some with
amusement, some with contempt, others with frank curiosity.

"You're plain nuts, Joe. What do you want to go to the Moon for?"

"Sure, why you wanna go? What they got on the Moon we ain't got right
here?"

There was general laughter from the dozen or so who sat eating their
lunch in the shade of Building B. They all thought that was a pretty
good one. Good enough to repeat. "Sure, what they got on the Moon we
ain't got here?"

But Joe Spain wasn't in the mood for jokes. He burned with even greater
conviction and stood up as though to harangue the workers. "You wanta
know why I got to go to the Moon? Why I've got to get on that ship? Then
I'll tell you. It's 'cause I'm a little guy--that's why! Joe
Spain--working stiff--one of the great inarticulate masses."

More laughter. "Where'd you get those big words, Joey? Out of a book?
Come on--talk English!"
