solid side felt good, but some other men pulled me off again. Yet it was
impossible to leave. This was wrong for me, and I had to make it right.
"I shall get my father to fight you, since he is a giant ten feet tall."

The men laughed at me, not knowing, of course, that my father is a giant
ten feet tall in truth, and my mother a sweet siren like those in the
books, the old books, with spells in her eyes and a strange power. They
did not know I was not a daydreaming child but a man who told truth.

And they laughed; I grew angry again and told them many things, calling
them names in Spanish, which they did not understand. That only made
them laugh the more.

Finally I left; it was necessary for me to leave, since I was not
wanted. But it was necessary, too, for me to make things right. Nights
later they were dead for what they had said and done.

For I tell the truth always, and I had told them about my sister and my
father and my mother. But one thing I had not told them.

I am sorry they could never know I was the winged thing that frightened
and killed them, one by one....
