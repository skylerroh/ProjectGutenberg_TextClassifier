operated upon, which is retained by a piece of rag tied over its lower
end. A quantity of a dilute solution of ammonia being then poured upon
the surface of the soil, and allowed to percolate, the first quantity
which flows away is found to have entirely lost its peculiar smell and
taste; and in a similar manner the removal of potash may be illustrated.
This action is by no means confined to those substances when in the free
state, but is equally marked when they are combined with acids in the
form of salts, and in the latter case the absorption is attended with a
true chemical decomposition, the base only being retained, and the acid
escaping most commonly in combination with lime. Thus, if sulphate of
ammonia be employed, the water which flows from the soil contains
sulphate of lime, and if muriate of ammonia be used, it is muriate of
lime which escapes.

This absorbent action is most remarkably manifested in the case of
ammonia and potash, but it takes place also with magnesia and soda. With
the latter, however, it is incomplete, only a half or a fourth of the
soda being removed from solution, the difference depending to some
extent on the acid with which it is in combination. The extent to which
absorption takes place varies also with the nature of the soil, and the
state of combination of the substance used. Exact experiments have
hitherto been chiefly confined to ammonia, potash, and lime in the free
state, and as bicarbonate; and the following table gives the results
obtained by Way, with solutions containing about 1 per cent of these
substances in solution:--

From these numbers it appears that very great differences exist in the
absorbent power of different soils, the first of those experimented on
being capable of taking more than twice as much ammonia as the second,
and nearly four times as much as the subsoil clay. It appears also, as
far as absorption goes, to be immaterial whether the ammonia is free or
combined. But it is different with potash, which is absorbed from the
nitrate to the extent of about O.6 per cent, and from a caustic solution
of potash to double that amount.

The circumstances under which absorption takes place modify, in a manner
which cannot well be explained, the amount absorbed by the same soil. It
is found generally to be most complete with very dilute solutions, and
if a soil be agitated with a quantity of ammonia larger than it can
take up, it will absorb only a certain amount of that substance, but by
a further increase of the amount of ammonia a still larger quantity will
be absorbed.

It is important to observe that when a salt is used, the base only is
absorbed, and the acid escapes in combination with lime; even nitric
acid, notwithstanding its importance as a food of plants, being in this
predicament. From this it may be gathered that lime is not readily
absorbed from solutions of its salts; indeed, it would appear that the
only salt of that substance liable to absorption is the bicarbonate,
from which it is taken to the extent of 1.4 per cent by the soil. The
absorption of lime from this salt, and that of phosphoric acid, which
takes place to a considerable extent, probably occurs, however, quite
independently of the clay present in the soil, and is occasioned by its
_lime_, which forms an insoluble compound with phosphoric acid, and by
removing half the carbonic acid of the bicarbonate of lime converts it
also into an insoluble state.

In addition to these mineral substances, organic matters are also
removed from solution. This is conspicuously seen in the case of putrid
urine, which not only loses its ammonia, but also its smell and colour,
when allowed to percolate through soil; and an equally marked result was
obtained with flax water, from which the organic matter was entirely
abstracted.

The cause of this absorptive power is still very imperfectly known. Mr.
Way having observed that sand has no such property, while clay, even
when obtained from a considerable depth, always possesses it, supposed
that the absorption was entirely due to that substance. A difficulty,
however, presents itself in explaining how it should happen that while a
pure clay absorbs only 0.2847 of ammonia, a loamy soil, of which
one-half probably is sand, should absorb a larger quantity. The
inference is, that the effect cannot be due to the clay as a whole, and
Mr. Way has sought to explain it by supposing that there exist in the
soil particular double silicates of alumina and lime. He has shown that
felspar and the other minerals from which the soil is produced have no
absorbent power, but that artificial compounds can be formed which act
upon solutions of ammonia and potash in a manner very similar to the
soil; but there is not the slightest evidence that these compounds exist
in the soil, and in the year 1853[I] I pointed out the probability that
clay is not the only agent at work, but that the organic matters take
part in the process. So powerful indeed is the affinity of these
substances for ammonia, that chemists are at one as to the difficulty of
obtaining humic and other similar acids pure, owing to the obstinacy
with which they retain it; and there cannot be a doubt that in many
soils these substances are in this point of view of much importance.
This is particularly the case in peat soils, which, though naturally
barren, may be made to produce good crops by the application of sand or
gravel; and as neither of these can cause any absorption of the valuable
matters, we must attribute this effect to the organic matter. Referring
to an earlier series of experiments made in 1850, I showed that, if a
quantity of dry peat be taken and ammonia poured on it, its smell
disappears; and this may be continued until upwards of 1.5 per cent of
dry ammonia has been absorbed, and this quantity is _retained_ by the
peat.

In this case pure ammonia was used, but Way's experiments having shown
that this alkali is not absorbed from its salts by organic matters, I
expressed the opinion that humate of lime (which certainly exists in
most soils) ought on chemical grounds to decompose the salts of ammonia
and cause the retention of their base. The recent researches of
Brustlein have shown that lime does cause the organic matters to absorb
ammonia from its salts. He confirms the fact that pure ammonia is
absorbed by peat, and shows that decayed wood has the same effect,
although both are without action on solutions of its salts. A stiff
clay, on the other hand, containing organic matters and much carbonate
of lime, readily absorbed ammonia, both when pure and combined; but
after extracting the lime by means of a dilute acid, it lost the power
of taking it from its salts, although it retained the free alkali as
completely as before. On the addition of a small quantity of lime, it
again acquired the power of withdrawing ammonia from its compounds.
These experiments may be explained, either on the supposition of the
presence of humate of lime, or by supposing that the carbonate of lime
first decomposed the salts of ammonia, and that the liberated alkali
combined with the organic matter. It must be admitted, however, that it
is very doubtful whether the ammonia and other substances are fixed in
the soil by a true chemical combination. They are certainly retained by
a very feeble attraction, for it appears from Brustlein's experiments
that ammonia may be, to a considerable extent, removed by washing with
abundance of water, and that if the soil which has absorbed ammonia be
allowed to become dry in the air, it loses half its ammonia, and after
four times moistening and drying, three-fourths have disappeared. These
facts are certainly not incompatible with the presence of a true
chemical compound, for the humate of ammonia is not absolutely
insoluble, and many cases occur of actions taking place in the presence
of water, which are entirely reversed when that fluid is removed; and it
is quite possible that when humate of ammonia is dried in contact with
carbonate of lime, it may be decomposed, and carbonate of ammonia
escape. There are other circumstances, however, which render it, on the
whole, most probable that the combination is not wholly chemical, but
rather of a physical character, among which may be more especially
mentioned the fact, that the quantity of the substances retained by the
soil is dependent on the degree of dilution of the fluid from which they
are taken; and that the quantity absorbed never exceeds a very small
fraction of the weight of the soil.

The practical inferences to be drawn from these facts regarding the
value of soils are of the highest importance. It is obvious that two
soils having exactly the same chemical composition may differ widely in
absorptive power, and that which possesses it most largely must have the
highest agricultural value. The examination of different soils, in this
point of view, is a subject of much importance, and deserves the best
attention of both farmers and chemists, although little has as yet been
done in regard to it, and the results which have been obtained are not
of a very satisfactory character. Liebig states, that in his
experiments, all the arable soils examined possessed the same absorptive
power, whether they contained a large or a small proportion of lime or
alumina. It can scarcely be expected, however, that this should be true
in all cases, and there are many facts which seem to indicate that
differences must exist. It is well known that there are some soils in
which the manure is very rapidly exhausted, and it is more than probable
that this effect is due to deficient absorptive power, which leaves the
soluble matters at the mercy of the weather, and liable at any moment
to be washed out by a heavy fall of rain.

The more strictly mechanical properties of the soil, such as its
relations to heat and moisture, are not less important than its chemical
composition. It is known that soils differ so greatly in these respects
as sometimes materially to affect their productive capacity. Thus, for
instance, two soils may be identical in composition, but one may be
highly hygrometric, that is, may absorb moisture readily from the air,
while the other may be very deficient in that property. Under ordinary
circumstances no difference will be apparent in their produce, but in a
dry season the crop upon the former may be in a flourishing condition,
while that on the latter is languishing and enfeebled, merely from its
inability to absorb from the air, and supply to the plant the quantity
of water required for its growth. In the same way, a soil which absorbs
much heat from the sun's rays surpasses another which has not that
property; and though in many cases this effect is comparatively
unimportant, in others it may make the difference between successful and
unsuccessful cultivation in soils which lie in an unfavourable climate
or exposure.

The investigation of the physical characters of soils has attracted
little attention, and we owe all our present knowledge of the subject to
a very elaborate series of researches on this subject, published by
Schuebler, nearly thirty years ago. He determined _1st_, The specific
gravity of the soils; _2d_, The quantity of water which they are capable
of imbibing; _3d_, The rapidity with which they give off by evaporation
the water they have imbibed; that is, their tendency to become dry;
_4th_, The extent to which they shrink in drying; _5th_, Their
hygrometric power; _6th_, The extent to which they are heated by the
sun's rays; _7th_, The rapidity with which a heated soil cools down,
which indicates its power of _retaining_ heat; _8th_, Their tenacity, or
the resistance they offer to the passage of agricultural implements;
_9th_, Their power of absorbing oxygen from the air. Each of these
experiments was performed on several different soils, and on their
mechanical constituents. Schuebler's experiments are undoubtedly
important, and though the methods employed are some of them not
altogether beyond cavil, they have apparently been performed with great
care. It is nevertheless desirable that they should be repeated, for
such facts ought not to rest on the authority of one experimenter,
however skilful and conscientious, nor on a single series of soils,
which may not give a fair representation of their general physical
properties. In fact, Schuebler appears to imagine that having once
determined the extent to which the sand, clay, and other mechanical
constituents of the soil possess these properties, we are in a condition
to predicate the effect of their mixture in variable proportions,
although this is by no means probable.

In examining these properties, Schuebler selected for experiment, pure
siliceous sand, calcareous sand (carbonate of lime in coarse grains),
finely powdered carbonate of lime, pure clay, humus, and powdered
gypsum. He used also a heavy clay consisting of 11 per cent of sand and
89 of pure clay, a somewhat stiff clay containing 24 per cent of sand
and 76 of clay, a light clay with 40 per cent of sand and 60 of pure
clay, a garden soil consisting of 52.4 per cent of clay, 36.5 of
siliceous sand, 1.8 of calcareous sand, 2 per cent of finely divided
carbonate of lime, and 7.2 of humus, and two arable soils, one from
Hoffwyl, and one from a valley in the Jura, the former a somewhat stiff,
the latter a light soil.

The experiments detailed in the preceding table speak in a great measure
for themselves, and scarcely require detailed comment. It may be
remarked, however, that the columns illustrating the relations of the
soil to water are probably more important than the others. The
superiority of a retentive over an open soil is sufficiently familiar in
practice, and though this is no doubt partly due to the former absorbing
and retaining more completely the ammonia and other valuable
constituents of the manures applied to it, it is also dependent to an
equal if not greater extent upon the power it possesses of retaining
moisture. A reference to the table makes it apparent that this power is
presented under three different heads, which are certainly related to
one another, but are not identical. In the second column of the table is
given the quantity of water absorbed by the soil, determined by placing
a given weight of the perfectly dry soil in a funnel, the neck of which
is partially stopped with a small piece of sponge or wool, pouring water
upon it, and weighing it after the water has ceased to drop from it.
This may be considered as representing the quantity of water retained by
these different soils when thoroughly saturated by long continued rains.
The column immediately succeeding gives the quantity of that water which
escapes by evaporation from the same soil after exposure for four hours
to dry air at the temperature of 66 deg.. The fifth, sixth, seventh, and
eighth columns indicate the quantity of moisture absorbed, when the
soil, previously artificially dried, is exposed to moist air for
different periods. These characters are dependent principally, though
not entirely, on the porosity of the soil. The last may also be in some
measure due to the presence of particular salts, such as common salt,
which has a great affinity for moisture, but is chiefly occasioned by
their peculiar structure. It is to be remarked that clay and humus are
two of the most highly hygrometric substances known, and it is
peculiarly interesting to observe, that by a beneficent provision of
nature, they also form a principal part of all fertile soils. The
quantity of water imbibed by the soil is important to its fertility, in
so far as it prevents it becoming rapidly dry after having been
moistened by the rains. It is valuable also in another point of view,
because if the soil be incapable of absorbing much water, it becomes
saturated by a moderate fall of rain, and when a larger quantity falls,
the excess of necessity percolates through the soil, and carries off
with it a certain quantity of the soluble salts. Important as this
property is, however, it must not be possessed in too high a degree, but
must permit the _evaporation_ of the water retained with a certain
degree of rapidity. Soils which do not admit of this taking place are
the cause of much inconvenience and injury in practice. By becoming
thoroughly saturated with moisture during winter, they remain for a long
time in a wet and unworkable condition, in consequence of which they
cannot be prepared and sown until late in the season, and though
chemically unexceptionable, they are always disadvantageous, and in some
seasons greatly disappoint the hopes of the farmer.

The extent to which the imbibition and evaporation of water takes place
is very variable, but they are obviously related to one another, the
soils which absorb it least abundantly parting with it again with the
greatest, facility; for it appears that siliceous sand absorbs only
one-fourth of its weight of water, and again gives off in the course of
four hours four-fifths of that it had taken up, while humus, which
imbibes nearly twice its weight, retains nine-tenths of that quantity
after four hours' exposure. Long-continued and slow evaporation of the
water absorbed by a soil is injurious in another way, for it makes the
soil "cold"--a term of practical origin, but which very correctly
expresses the peculiarity in question. It is due to the fact, that when
water evaporates it absorbs a very large quantity of heat, which
prevents the soil acquiring a sufficiently high temperature from the
sun's rays. The soils which have absorbed a large quantity of moisture
shrink more or less in the process of drying, and form cracks, which
often break the delicate fibres of the roots of the plants, and cause
considerable injury: the extent of this shrinking is given in the fourth
column.

The relation of the soils to heat divides itself into two
considerations: the amount of heat absorbed by the soil, and the degree
in which it is retained. Of these the latter only is illustrated in the
table. The former is dependent on so many special considerations, that
the results cannot be tabulated in a satisfactory manner. It is
independent of the chemical nature of the soil, but varies to a great
extent according to its colour, the angle of incidence of the sun's
rays, and its state of moisture. It is, however, an important character,
and has been found by Girardin to exercise a considerable influence on
the rapidity with which the crop ripens. He found in a particular year
that, on the 25th of August, 26 varieties of potatoes were ripe on a
very dark-coloured sandy vegetable mould, 20 on an ordinary sandy soil,
19 on a loamy soil, and only 16 on a nearly white calcareous soil.

The tenacity of the soil is very variable, and indicates the great
differences in the amount of power which must be expended in working
them. According to Schuebler, a soil whose tenacity does not exceed 10,
is easily tilled, but when it reaches 40 it becomes very difficult and
heavy to work.

On examining the table it becomes manifest, that as far as its
mechanical properties are concerned, humus is a substance of the very
