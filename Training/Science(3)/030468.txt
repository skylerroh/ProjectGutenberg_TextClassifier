    _Would you like to see all hell break loose? Just make a few holes
    in nothing at all--push some steel beams through the holes--and then
    head for the hills. But first, read what happened to some people who
    really did it._


        HOLES
     INCORPORATED

 By L. Major Reynolds


The red-headed secretary asked, "Names, please?"

"Ted Baker."

"Bill Stephens."

"To see H. Joshua Blair. We have an appointment."

"It's for three-thirty. We called up two weeks ago."

The secretary said, "Oh, yes. I have you on the list." She checked them
off, studied them vaguely, asked, "What was it you wanted to see Mr.
Blair about?"

Ted Baker held out the small steel box he was carrying. "About this."

"Ah--what is it?"

"It's a box."

"I can see that," the redhead snapped. "What is it for? What does it
do?"
