You and Allie and I will all be back on Titan very soon."

These three began to be aware that a crowd of still befuddled but
happy colonists were gathering around them. Another Space Patrol man
approached, and said very officially:

"Mr. and Mrs. Kraskow, and Mr. Lawler: Our large ship leaves for Earth
in five hours. Be ready to blast off. As you are aware, certain still
valid charges were lodged against you by Trenton Lauren. You used
dangerous equipment, not yet legally approved. As you are also aware,
you must go to answer these charges. Sorry. But we of the Patrol know
the score. In the face of your success I'm sure that this is mere red
tape."

Bert scowled until he saw the cop's sly grin.

"Worried?" Alice asked him, smiling. She was pretty. She had courage.
She had everything.

"Worried?" Bert echoed. In general he approved the S.P.A.B. "How can
we lose on this last gamble with all the cards stacked in our favor.
We even win a needed short vacation on Earth!"

"What are you two gonna bring back for me?" an old man, grimed from
the forges, demanded, grinning. It was old Stan Kraskow, who had
buried his younger son in the camp cemetery.

"Hiyuh, Dad!" Bert greeted happily. "What'll we bring him, Allie?"

"Wildbirds, Pop," Alice answered, her eyes twinkling. "You always
liked wildbirds. No world is complete without them."

Bert noticed that the gardens of the camp, planted weeks ago under
airdomes that were now being cleared away, were now showing a faint
green. The beginning of a new and verdant Titan.
