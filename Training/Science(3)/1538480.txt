and now have _unequaled facilities_ for the preparation of Patent
Drawings, Specifications, and the Prosecution of Applications for
Patents in the United States. Canada, and Foreign Countries. Messrs.
Munn & Co. also attend to the preparation of Caveats, Trade Mark
Regulations, Copyrights for Books, Labels, Reissues, Assignments, and
Reports on Infringements of Patents. All business intrusted to them is
done with special care and promptness, on very moderate terms.

We send free of charge, on application, a pamphlet containing
further information about Patents and how to procure them; directions
concerning Trade Marks, Copyrights, Designs, Patents, Appeals,
Reissues, Infringements, Assignments, Rejected Cases, Hints on the
Sale of Patents, etc.

_FOREIGN PATENTS._--We also send, _free of charge_, a Synopsis of
Foreign Patent Laws, showing the cost and method of securing patents
in all the principal countries of the world. American inventors should
bear in mind that, as a general rule, any invention that is valuable
to the patentee in this country is worth equally as much in England
and some other foreign countries. Five patents--embracing Canadian,
English, German, French, and Belgian--will secure to an inventor the
exclusive monopoly to his discovery among about ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
MILLIONS of the most intelligent people in the world. The facilities
of business and steam communication are such that patents can be
obtained abroad by our citizens almost as easily as at home. The
expense to apply for an English patent is $75; German, $100; French,
$100; Belgian, $100; Canadian, $50. _COPIES OF PATENTS._--Persons
desiring any patent issued from 1836 to November 26, 1867, can be
supplied with official copies at reasonable cost, the price depending
upon the extent of drawings and length of specifications.

Any patent issued since November 27, 1867, at which time the Patent
Office commenced printing the drawings and specifications, may be had
by remitting to this office $1.

A copy of the claims of any patent issued since 1836 will be furnished
for $1.

When ordering copies, please to remit for the same as above, and state
name of patentee, title of invention, and date of patent.

A pamphlet, containing full directions for obtaining United States
patents sent free. A handsomely bound Reference Book, gilt edges,
contains 140 pages and many engravings and tables important to every
patentee and mechanic, and is a useful hand book of reference for
everybody. Price 25 cents, mailed free.

A GOOD PLAN

_The most profitable plan_ for operating in stocks is by uniting
capital of various sums in combining or pooling orders of thousands
of customers and using them as _one mighty whole_, which is done so
successfully by Messrs. Lawrence & Co., Bankers, 57 Exchange Place,
N. Y. City. By this cooperative system each investor is placed on an
equal footing with the largest operator and profits divided _pro rata_
among shareholders every 30 days. $10 invested makes $50 or 5 per cent.
on the stock during the month--$50 returns $350 or 7 per cent., $100
pays $1,000, or 10 per cent., and so on according to the market. The
firm's new circular (copyrighted and free) contains "Two unerring
rules for success in stock operations," and explains everything. All
kinds of Stocks and Bonds wanted. New Government Loan supplied.
