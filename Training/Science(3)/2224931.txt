price, and it is that usually adopted, though L8 and L10 have sometimes
been assumed as the average.

_Ammonia_ is met with in commerce as muriate and sulphate of ammonia.
The former, owing to its high price, is practically excluded from use as
a manure; the latter sells at present at from L15 to L15: 10s. per ton,
and, making allowance for the usual amount of impurity (5 or 6 per
cent), the actual ammonia is worth about L63 per ton. Calculating from
other substances it appears that ammonia is worth, per ton, in--

Sulphate of ammonia    L63 0 0
Bones                   61 0 0
Peruvian guano          57 0 0

the average being L60, which is the price usually adopted.

_Sulphate of Lime_ and _Alkaline Salts_ (consisting chiefly of soda) are
generally estimated at Ll per ton; and potash in those cases, in which
it is necessary to take it into account, is usually valued at from L20
to L30 per ton, the former being its value in kelp, the form in which it
can be most cheaply purchased.

_Nitrate of Soda_ is usually sold at from L15 to L15: 10s. per ton, and,
making allowance for impurities, L16 may be taken as the value of the
pure salt.

_Biphosphate of Lime, Soluble Phosphates._--Considerable difficulty is
experienced in estimating the value of these substances, because they
are not met with in commerce alone, or in any form except that of
superphosphate, and the prices at which they are sold in different
samples of that manure differ excessively. The only course by which any
result can be obtained, is to determine the average price of a good
superphosphate, and putting the values already ascertained on all the
other constituents to reckon the difference between that sum and the
market price as the value of soluble phosphates. Throwing out, as
inferior, all samples containing less than 10 per cent of soluble
phosphates, and taking the good only, I find that the average
composition of the phosphates in the market during the present year has
been--

Water                                    10.71
Organic matter                            9.33
Biphosphate of lime equivalent to 19.43
    "soluble phosphates"                 12.45
Insoluble phosphates                     14.78
Sulphate of lime                         45.24
Alkaline salts                            2.11
Sand                                      5.38
                                        ------
                                        100.00
Ammonia                                   1.71

It is more difficult to fix the average price of superphosphate, as in
many cases no information could be obtained on this point; but among
those analyzed were samples at all prices, from L7 up to L10: 10s. per
ton, so that on the whole, L8 may be assumed as an average, and in that
case soluble phosphates are worth L27: 19s. per ton. Had the inferior
samples been included, the price would have been higher, and in fact the
rate at which soluble phosphates have been commonly estimated is L30 per
ton, or L46: 16s. for biphosphate of lime, although sometimes the former
have been reckoned as low as L25, with a corresponding rate for the
latter. It is important that biphosphate of lime and soluble phosphates
should not be confounded with one another in valuing a manure, the
latter having one and a half times the value of the former.

As manures are liable to considerable fluctuations in price, the value
attached to each of their constituents ought to be varied with the state
of the market; but it is obviously impossible for the farmer to watch
the changes in price with such minuteness as to enable him to do this,
and it is much more convenient, as well as safer, to adopt a fixed
average, which can be used with reasonable accuracy at all times. The
fact is, that this system of valuation is only an approximation to the
truth; and if absolute accuracy were aimed at, it would be necessary to
vary the estimates, not only at different times, but at different
localities at the same time, and to some extent also according to the
kind of manure. The price of soluble phosphates more especially,
fluctuates to a great extent, being practically fixed by each
manufacturer according to the facilities which his position or command
of raw material offer for producing them at a low rate. We thus find
that when made from bones alone, the cost of that substance is not
unfrequently as high as L40 per ton, and when bone-ash alone is used it
is sometimes as low as L20. Such extreme differences, of course, cannot
be taken into account in the system of valuation adopted, where all that
can be done is to take average values, which, when applied to average
samples, ought to bring out their value.

The data which have already been given regarding the price of the
individual constituents of manures can be applied to the determination
of the value of any mixture in two different ways by means of the
subjoined table:--

+----------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+
|                            | Price per Ton.  | Per cent per Ton. |
+----------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+

+----------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+

Supposing it be desired to calculate the value of a manure by the first
column, it is obvious that if we suppose 100 tons to be purchased, the
per centages of the different constituents shewn in the analysis will
give the number of tons of each contained in 100 tons of the mixture,
and, selecting the analysis of the superphosphate given in a previous
page, we proceed in the calculation as follows:--

14.11 tons of organic matter at 10s.   L7  0  0
14.86 " soluble phosphates at L30     446  0  0
15.13 " insoluble phosphates at L7    105  0  0
39.43 " sulphate of lime at L1         39  0  0
 3.82 " alkaline salts at L1            4  0  0
 2.10 " ammonia at L60                126  0  0
                                     ----------
          Value of 100 tons          L727  0  0
or L7 : 5s. per ton.

According to the second column, the numbers give the sum by which the
per centages of each ingredient must be multiplied, to give its value
in a ton of manure, and it is used for the same manure in the following
manner:--

14.11 organic matter, multiplied by      1-1/4d.       L0  1  5
14.88 soluble phosphates  "          6s.                4  9  2
15.13 insoluble phosphates "         1s. 5d.            1  1  4
39.43 sulphate of lime    "              2-4/10d.       O  8 10
 3.82 alkaline salts     "               2-4/10d.       O  O  9
 2.10 ammonia       "               12s.                1  5  3
                                                       --------
                    Value per ton                      L7  6  9

The difference is due to the less minute calculation of fractional
quantities in the latter case.

The calculation of the value of any other manure is effected in exactly
the same manner, taking care, however, to use the higher value for
phosphates in the case of a phosphatic guano. It will be obvious to
every one who tries the two methods that the first greatly exceeds the
second in convenience and simplicity in the calculations, and it is that
most commonly in use, although some persons prefer the second.

Although the data just given must always form the basis of the valuation
of any manure, there are a variety of other circumstances which must be
taken into account, and which give great scope for the judgment and
experience of the valuator. Of these the most important is the proper
admixture of the ingredients, and the condition of the manure as regards
dryness, complete reduction to the pulverulent state, and the like. A
certain allowance ought always to be made for careful manufacture; and,
on the other hand, where the manure is damp or ill reduced, a small
deduction (the amount of which must be decided by the experience of the
valuator) ought to be made on account of the risk which the farmer runs
of loss from unequal distribution, and the extra cost of carriage of an
unnecessary quantity of water.

It is also necessary to take into account the particular element
required by the soil. Thus, a farmer who finds his soil wants
phosphates, will look to the manure containing the largest quantity of
that substance, and possibly not requiring ammonia, will not care to
estimate at its full value any quantity of that substance which he may
be compelled to take along with the former, but will look only to the
source from which he can obtain it most cheaply. It may be well,
therefore, to point out that ammonia is most cheaply purchased in
Peruvian guano; insoluble phosphates in coprolites; and soluble
phosphates in superphosphates, made from bone-ash alone. In general,
however, it will be found most advantageous to select manures in which
the constituents are properly adjusted to one another, so that neither
ammonia, soluble nor insoluble phosphates, preponderate; but, of course,
it must frequently happen that it will prove more economical to buy the
substances separately and to make the mixture, than to take the manure
in which they are ready mixed.

In judging of the value of any manure, it is also important to make sure
that the analysis which forms the basis of the calculation is that of a
fair sample, which correctly represents the bulk actually delivered to
the purchaser, and not one which has been made to do duty for an
unlimited quantity of manure, which is supposed to be all of equal
quality, as often happens in the hands of careless manufacturers, and
too great attention cannot be devoted to the selection of the sample,
which is very often done in an exceedingly slovenly manner.




CHAPTER XIII.

THE ROTATION OF CROPS.


Reference has already been more than once made to the fact that a crop
growing in any soil must necessarily exhaust it to a greater or less
extent by withdrawing from it a certain quantity of the elements to
which its fertility is due. That this is the case has been long admitted
in practice, and it has also been established that the exhausting
effects of different species of plants are very different; that while
some rapidly impoverish the soil, others may be cultivated for a number
of years without material injury, and some even _apparently_ improve it.
Thus, it is a notorious fact that white crops exhaust, while grass
improves the soil; but the improvement in the latter case is really
dependent on the fact, that when the land is laid down in pasture,
nothing is removed from it, the cattle which feed on its produce
restoring all but a minute fraction of the mineral matters contained in
their food; and as the plants derive a part, and in some instances a
very large part, of their organic constituents from the air, the
fertility of the soil must manifestly be increased, or at all events
maintained in its previous state. When, however, the plant, or any
portion of it, is removed from the soil, there must be a reduction of
fertility dependent on the quantity of valuable matters withdrawn by it;
and thus it happens that when a plant has grown on any soil, and has
removed from it a large quantity of nutritive matters, it becomes
incapable of producing an equally large crop of the same species; and if
the attempt be made to grow it in successive years, the land becomes
incapable of producing it at all, and is then said to be thoroughly
exhausted. But if the exhausted land be allowed to lie for some time
without a crop, it regains its fertility more or less rapidly according
to circumstances, and again produces the same plant in remunerative
quantity. The observation of this fact led to the introduction of naked
fallows, which, up to a comparatively recent period, were an essential
feature in agriculture. But after a time it was observed that the land
which had been exhausted by successive crops of one species was not
absolutely barren, but was still capable of producing a luxuriant growth
of other plants. Thus peas, beans, clover, or potatoes, could be
cultivated with success on land which would no longer sustain a crop of
grain, and these plants came into use in place of the naked fallow under
the name of fallow crops. On this was founded the rotation of crops; for
it was clear that a judicious interchange of the plants grown might
enable the soil to regain its fertility for one crop at the time when it
was producing another; and when exhausted for the second, it might be
again ready to bear crops of the first.

The necessity for a rotation of crops has been explained in several
ways. The oldest view is that of Decandolle, who founded his theory on
the fact that the plants excrete certain substances from their roots. He
found that when plants are grown in water, a peculiar matter is thrown
off by the roots; and he believed that this extrementitious substance is
eliminated _because_ it is injurious to the plant, and that, remaining
in the soil, it acts as a poison to those of the same species, and so
prevents the growth of another crop. But this excretion, though
poisonous to the plants from which it is excreted, he believed to be
nutritive to those of another species which is thus enabled to grow
luxuriantly where the others failed. Nothing can be more simple than
this explanation, and it was readily embraced at the time it was
propounded and considered fully satisfactory. But when more minutely
examined, it becomes apparent that the facts on which it is founded are
of a very uncertain character. Decandolle's observations regarding the
radical excretions of plants have not been confirmed by subsequent
observers. On the contrary, it has been shewn that though some plants,
when growing in water, do excrete a particular substance in small
quantity, nothing of the sort appears when they are grown in a siliceous
sand. And hence the inference is, that the peculiar excretion of plants
growing in water is to be viewed as the result of the abnormal method of
their growth rather than as a natural product of vegetation. But even
admitting the existence of these matters, it would be impossible to
accept the explanation founded upon them, because it is a familiar fact
that, on some soils, the repeated growth of particular crops is
perfectly possible, as, for instance, on the virgin soils of America,
from which many successive crops of wheat have been taken; and in these
cases the alleged excretion must have taken place without producing any
deleterious effect on the crop. Besides, it is in the last degree
improbable that these excretions, consisting of soluble organic matters,
should remain in the soil without undergoing decomposition, as all
similar substances do; and even if they did, we cannot, with our present
knowledge of the food of plants, admit the possibility of the direct
absorption of any organic substance whatever. Indeed, the idea of
radical excretions, as an explanation of the rotation of crops, must be
considered as being entirely abandoned.

The necessity for a rotation of crops is now generally attributed to the
different quantities of valuable matters which different plants remove
from the soil, and more especially to their mineral constituents. It has
been already observed that great differences exist in the composition of
the ash of different plants in the section on that subject; and it was
stated that a distinction has been made between lime, potash, and silica
plants, according as one or other of these elements preponderate in
their ashes. The remarkable difference in the proportion of these
elements has been supposed to afford an explanation of rotation. It is
supposed that if a plant requiring a large quantity of any one element,
potash, for example, be grown during a succession of years on the same
soil, it will sooner or later exhaust all, or nearly all, the potash
that soil contains in an _available_ form, and it will consequently
cease to produce a luxuriant crop. But if this plant be replaced by
another which requires only a small quantity of potash and a large
quantity of lime, it will flourish, because it finds what is necessary
to its growth. In the meantime, the changes which are proceeding in the
soil, are liberating new quantities of the inorganic matters from those
forms of combination in which they are not immediately available, and
when after a time the plant which requires potash is again sown on the
soil, it finds a sufficient quantity to serve its purpose. We have
already, in treating of the ashes of plants, pointed out the extent of
the differences which exist; but these will be made more obvious by the
annexed table, giving the quantity of the different mineral matters
contained in the produce of an imperial acre of the different crops.

The minor constituents, such as oxide of iron, manganese, etc., have
been omitted as being of little importance; and the quantity of
nitrogen, which is of great moment in estimating the exhaustive effects
of various crops, has been added.

In examining this table, it becomes apparent that while in regard to
some of the elements, the quantities removed by different crops do not
differ to any marked extent, in others the variation is very great. The
cereals and grasses are especially distinguished by the larger quantity
of silica they contain, and the exhaustive effect consequent upon the
removal of both grain and straw from soils which contain but a limited
supply of that substance in an available condition is obvious. It is
clear that under such circumstances the frequent repetition of a cereal
crop may so far diminish the amount of available silica as to render its
cultivation impossible, although the other substances may be present in
sufficient quantity to produce a plentiful crop of any plant which does
not require that element. Beans and peas, turnips and hay, on the other
hand, require a very large quantity of alkalies, and especially of
potash.

Looking more minutely, however, into this matter, certain points attract
attention which appear to be at variance with commonly received
opinions. With the exception of silica, for example, the cereals do not
withdraw from the soil so large a quantity of mineral matters as some of
the so-called fallow crops, and if their straw be returned to the soil
