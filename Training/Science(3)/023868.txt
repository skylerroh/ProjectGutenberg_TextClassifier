           _In perspective, theoretically the vanishing
           point is at infinity, and therefore unattainable.
           But reality is different; vanishment occurs a lot
           sooner than theory suggests ..._

That? Oh, that's a perspective machine. Well, not exactly, but that's
what I call it. No, I don't know how it works. Too complicated for me.
Carter could make it go, but after he made it he never used it. Too bad;
he thought he'd make a lot of money with it there for awhile, while he
was working it out. Almost had me convinced, but I told him, "Get it to
working first, Carter, and then show me what you can do with it better
than I can do without it. I'm doing pretty well as is ... pictures
selling good, even if I do make 'em all by guesswork, as you call it."
