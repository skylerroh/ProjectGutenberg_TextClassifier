regarded as derived from oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids
respectively, by replacing the hydrogen of the acid with the glycerin
radical C_{3}H_{5}. Since this radical is trivalent and oleic, palmitic,
and stearic acids contain only one replaceable hydrogen atom to the
molecule, it is evident that three molecules of each acid must enter
into each molecule of the ethereal salt. The formulas for the acids and
the ethereal salts derived from each are as follows:

    HC_{18}H_{33}O_{2}                 (oleic acid)
    C_{8}H_{6}(C_{18}H_{33}O_{2})_{3}, (olein)

    HC_{16}H_{31}O_{2}                (palmitic acid)
    C_{3}H_{5}(C_{16}H_{31}0_{2})_{3} (palmitin)

    HC_{18}H_{35}O_{2}                (stearic acid)
    C_{3}H_{5}(C_{18}H_{35}O_{2})_{3} (stearin)

Olein is a liquid and is the main constituent of liquid fats. Palmitin
and stearin are solids.

~Butter fat and oleomargarine.~ Butter fat consists principally of olein,
palmitin, and stearin. The flavor of the fat is due to the presence of a
small amount of butyrin, which is an ethereal salt of butyric acid.
Oleomargarine differs from butter mainly in the fact that a smaller
amount of butyrin is present. It is made from the fats obtained from
cattle and hogs. This fat is churned up with milk, or a small amount of
butter is added, in order to furnish sufficient butyrin to impart the
butter flavor.

~Saponification.~ When an ethereal salt is heated with an alkali a
reaction expressed by the following equation takes place:

    C_{2}H_{5}NO_{3} + KOH = C_{2}H_{5}OH + KNO_{3}.

This process is known as _saponification_, since it is the one which
takes place in the manufacture of soaps. The ordinary soaps are made by
heating fats with a solution of sodium hydroxide. The reactions
involved may be illustrated by the following equation representing the
reaction between palmitin and sodium hydroxide:

    C_{3}H_{5}(C_{16}H_{31}O_{2})_{3} + 3 NaOH
         = 3 NaC_{16}H_{31}O_{2} + C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{3}.

In accordance with this equation the ethereal salts in the fats are
converted into glycerin and the sodium salts of the corresponding acids.
The sodium salts are separated and constitute the soaps. These salts are
soluble in water. When added to water containing calcium salts the
insoluble calcium palmitate and stearate are precipitated. Magnesium
salts act in a similar way. It is because of these facts that soap is
used up by hard waters.


ETHERS

When ethyl alcohol is heated to 140 deg. with sulphuric acid the reaction
expressed by the following equation takes place:

    2C_{2}H_{5}OH = (C_{2}H_{5})_{2}O + H_{2}O.

The resulting compound, (C_{2}H_{5})_{2}O, is ordinary ether and is the
most important member of the class of compounds called _ethers_.
Ordinarily ether is a light, very inflammable liquid boiling at 35 deg.. It
is used as a solvent for organic substances and as an anaesthetic in
surgical operations.


KETONES

The most common member of this group is acetone (C_{3}H_{6}O), a
colorless liquid obtained when wood is heated in the absence of air. It
is used in the preparation of other organic compounds, especially
chloroform.


ORGANIC BASES

This group includes a number of compounds, all of which contain nitrogen
as well as carbon. They are characterized by combining directly with
acids to form salts, and in this respect they resemble ammonia. They
may, indeed, be regarded as derived from ammonia by displacing a part or
all of the hydrogen present in ammonia by hydrocarbon radicals. Among
the simplest of these compounds may be mentioned methylamine
(CH_{3}NH_{2}) and ethylamine (C_{2}H_{5}NH_{2}). These two compounds
are gases and are formed in the distillation of wood and bones. Pyridine
(C_{5}H_{6}N) and quinoline (C_{9}H_{7}N) are liquids present in small
amounts in coal tar, and also in the liquid obtained by the distillation
of bones. Most of the compounds now classified under the general name of
_alkaloids_ (which see) also belong to this group.


CARBOHYDRATES

The term "carbohydrate" is applied to a class of compounds which
includes the sugars, starch, and allied bodies These compounds contain
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen the last two elements generally being
present in the proportion in which they combine to form water. The most
important members of this class are the following:

    Cane sugar      C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}.
    Milk sugar      C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}.
    Dextrose        C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}.
    Levulose        C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}.
    Cellulose       C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}.
    Starch          C_{6}H_{10}0_{5}.

~Cane sugar~ (C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}). This is the well-known substance
commonly called sugar. It occurs in many plants especially in the sugar
cane and sugar beet. It was formerly obtained almost entirely from the
sugar cane, but at present the greatest amount of it comes from the
sugar beet. The juice from the cane or beet contains the sugar in
solution along with many impurities. These impurities are removed, and
the resulting solution is then evaporated until the sugar crystallizes
out. The evaporation is conducted in closed vessels from which the air
is partially exhausted. In this way the boiling point of the solution is
lowered and the charring of the sugar is prevented. It is impossible to
remove all the sugar from the solution. In preparing sugar from sugar
cane the liquors left after separating as much of it as possible from
the juice of the cane constitute ordinary molasses. Maple sugar is made
by the evaporation of the sap obtained from a species of the maple tree.
Its sweetness is due to the presence of cane sugar, other products
present in the maple sap imparting the distinctive flavor.

When a solution of cane sugar is heated with hydrochloric or other
dilute mineral acid, two compounds, dextrose and levulose, are formed in
accordance with the following equation:

    C_{12}H_{22}O_{11} + H_{2}O = C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}.

This same change is brought about by the action of an enzyme present in
the yeast plant. When yeast is added to a solution of cane sugar
fermentation is set up. The cane sugar, however, does not ferment
directly: the enzyme in the yeast first transforms the sugar into
dextrose and levulose, and these sugars then undergo alcoholic
fermentation.

When heated to 160 deg. cane sugar melts; if the temperature is increased to
about 215 deg., a partial decomposition takes place and a brown substance
known as caramel forms. This is used largely as a coloring matter.

~Milk sugar~ (C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}). This sugar is present in the milk of
all mammals. The average composition of cow's milk is as follows:

    Water                        87.17%
    Casein (nitrogenous matter)   3.56
    Butter fat                    3.64
    Milk sugar                    4.88
    Mineral matter                0.75

When _rennin_, an enzyme obtained from the stomach of calves, is added
to milk, the casein separates and is used in the manufacture of cheese.
The remaining liquid contains the milk sugar which separates on
evaporation; it resembles cane sugar in appearance but is not so sweet
or soluble. The souring of milk is due to the fact that the milk sugar
present undergoes _lactic fermentation_ in accordance with the equation

    C_{12}H_{22}O_{11} + H_{2}O = 4C_{3}H_{6}O_{3}.

The lactic acid formed causes the separation of the casein, thus giving
the well-known appearance of sour milk.

~Isomeric compounds.~ It will be observed that cane sugar and milk sugar
have the same formulas. Their difference in properties is due to the
different arrangement of the atoms in the molecule. Such compounds are
said to be isomeric. Dextrose and levulose are also isomeric.

~Dextrose~ (_grape sugar, glucose_) (C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}). This sugar is
present in many fruits and is commonly called grape sugar because of its
presence in grape juice. It can be obtained by heating cane sugar with
dilute acids, as explained above; also by heating starch with dilute
acids, the change being as follows:

    C_{6}H_{10}6_{5} + H_{2}O = C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}.

Pure dextrose is a white crystalline solid, readily soluble in water,
and is not so sweet as cane sugar. In the presence of yeast it undergoes
alcoholic fermentation. It is prepared from starch in large quantities,
and being less expensive than cane sugar, is used as a substitute for it
in the manufacture of jellies, jams, molasses, candy, and other sweets.
The product commonly sold under the name of _glucose_ contains about 45%
of dextrose.

~Levulose~ _(fruit sugar)_(C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}). This sugar is a white solid
which occurs along with dextrose in fruits and honey. It undergoes
alcoholic fermentation in the presence of yeast.

~Cellulose~ (C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}). This forms the basis of all woody fibers.
Cotton and linen are nearly pure cellulose. It is insoluble in water,
alcohol, and dilute acids. Sulphuric acid slowly converts it into
dextrose. Nitric acid forms nitrates similar to nitroglycerin in
composition and explosive properties. These nitrates are variously known
as nitrocellulose, pyroxylin, and gun cotton. When exploded they yield
only colorless gases; hence they are used especially in the manufacture
of smokeless gunpowder. _Collodion_ is a solution of nitrocellulose in a
mixture of alcohol and ether. _Celluloid_ is a mixture of nitrocellulose
and camphor. _Paper_ consists mainly of cellulose, the finer grades
being made from linen and cotton rags, and the cheaper grades from straw
and wood.

~Starch~ (C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}). This is by far the most abundant carbohydrate
found in nature, being present especially in seeds and tubers. In the
United States it is obtained chiefly from corn, nearly 80% of which is
starch. In Europe it is obtained principally from the potato. It
consists of minute granules and is practically insoluble in cold water.
These granules differ somewhat in appearance, according to the source of
the starch, so that it is often possible to determine from what plant
the starch was obtained. When heated with water the granules burst and
the starch partially dissolves. Dilute acids, as well as certain
enzymes, convert it into dextrose or similar sugars. When seeds
germinate the starch present is converted into soluble sugars, which are
used as food for the growing plant.

~Chemical changes in bread making.~ The average composition of wheat flour
is as follows:

    Water.                           13.8%
    Protein (nitrogenous matter)      7.9
    Fats                              1.4
    Starch                           76.4
    Mineral matter                    0.5

In making bread the flour is mixed with water and yeast, and the
resulting dough set aside in a warm place for a few hours. The yeast
first converts a portion of the starch into dextrose or a similar sugar,
which then undergoes alcoholic fermentation. The carbon dioxide formed
escapes through the dough, making it light and porous. The yeast plant
thrives best at about 30 deg.; hence the necessity for having the dough in a
warm place. If the temperature rises above 50 deg., the vitality of the
yeast is destroyed and fermentation ceases. In baking the bread, the
heat expels the alcohol and also expands the bubbles of carbon dioxide
caught in the dough, thus increasing its lightness.


SOME DERIVATIVES OF BENZENE

Attention has been called to the complex nature of coal tar. Among the
compounds present are the hydrocarbons, benzene, toluene, naphthalene,
and anthracene. These compounds are not only useful in themselves but
serve for the preparation of many other important compounds known under
the general name of coal-tar products.

~Nitrobenzene~ (_oil of myrbane_) (C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2}). When benzene is
treated with nitric acid a reaction takes place which is expressed by
the following equation:

    C_{6}H_{6} + HNO_{3} = C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2} + H_{2}O.

The product C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2} is called nitrobenzene. It is a slightly
yellowish poisonous liquid, with a characteristic odor. Its main use is
in the manufacture of aniline.

~Aniline~ (C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2}). When nitrobenzene is heated with iron and
hydrochloric acid the hydrogen evolved by the action of the iron upon
the acid reduces the nitrobenzene in accordance with the following
equation:

    C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2} + 6H = C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2} + 2H_{2}O.

The resulting compound is known as aniline, a liquid boiling at 182 deg..
When first prepared it is colorless, but darkens on standing. Large
quantities of it are used in the manufacture of the _aniline or coal-tar
dyes_, which include many important compounds.

~Carbolic acid~ (C_{6}H_{5}OH). This compound, sometimes known as
_phenol_, occurs in coal tar, and is also prepared from benzene. It
forms colorless crystals which are very soluble in water. It is strongly
corrosive and very poisonous.

~Naphthalene and anthracene.~ These are hydrocarbons occurring along with
benzene in coal tar. They are white solids, insoluble in water. The
well-known _moth balls_ are made of naphthalene. Large quantities of
naphthalene are used in the preparation of _indigo_, a dye formerly
obtained from the indigo plant, but now largely prepared by laboratory
methods. Similarly anthracene is used in the preparation of the dye
_alizarin_, which was formerly obtained from the madder root.


THE ALKALOIDS

This term is applied to a group of compounds found in many plants and
trees. They all contain nitrogen, and most of them are characterized by
their power to combine with acids to form salts. This property is
indicated by the name alkaloids, which signifies alkali-like. The salts
are soluble in water, and on this account are more largely used than the
free alkaloids, which are insoluble in water. Many of the alkaloids are
used in medicine, some of the more important ones being given below.

~Quinine.~ This alkaloid occurs along with a number of others in the bark
of certain trees which grow in districts in South America and also in
Java and other tropical islands. It is a white solid, and its sulphate
is used in medicine in the treatment of fevers.

~Morphine.~ When incisions are made in the unripe capsules of one of the
varieties of the poppy plant, a milky juice exudes which soon thickens.
This is removed and partially dried. The resulting substance is the
ordinary _opium_ which contains a number of alkaloids, the principal one
being morphine. This alkaloid is a white solid and is of great service
in medicine.

Among the other alkaloids may be mentioned the following: _Nicotine_, a
very poisonous liquid, the salts of which occur in the leaves of the
tobacco plant; _cocaine_, a crystalline solid present in coca leaves and
used in medicine as a local anaesthetic; _atropine_, a solid present in
the berry of the deadly nightshade, and used in the treatment of
diseases of the eye; _strychnine_, a white, intensely poisonous solid
present in the seeds of the members of the _Strychnos_ family.
