
The group moved slowly through the city. As if nothing had happened, the
instructor explained what they were seeing. When they asked questions,
he answered them. Billy Kasker asked no more questions.

They finally came to the gate and the same resplendent captain greeted
them. He accepted the _Thor_ gun and the holster, handed them to the
guard.

"How are things in the museum?"

"Everything is in good order, sir."

"Good. I've had the impression they were getting a little restless
lately."

"I saw no signs of it."

"Fine. Did you have any trouble with the group?"

"Very little. Billy Kasker wandered off for a few moments and I had to
demote him. But it was nothing. See you next year when I bring another

"Why, Billy, in that case I will be glad to come home with you."

They moved away together. "There's one thing I want made completely
clear," Billy Kasker said.

"What is that?"

"When the time comes, there is one conqueror I've got on _my_ list!"

"That jerk I made class president? Of course, Billy. We will be glad to
save him for you alone." The instructor's smile was a happy one.

"Good. That's agreed then." In the gathering dusk, Billy Kasker's voice
was as sharp as the edge of a knife driving home into a throat from
which green blood spurted....
