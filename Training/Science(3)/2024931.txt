however, exert a chemical action on the soil, altogether independent of
their absorption by the plant, but its nature and amount are still to
determine.

_Silicates of Potash and Soda_ have been employed with the view of
supplying silica to the plant, but the results have been far from
satisfactory. This may perhaps have been due to the doubtful nature of
the commercial article, but now that silicate of soda can be obtained of
good quality, it is desirable that the experiments should be repeated.
It is said to have produced good effects on the potato.

_Sulphate of Magnesia_ can be obtained at a low cost, and has been used
as a manure in some instances with very marked success. It has been
chiefly applied as a top-dressing to clover hay, but it seems probable
that it might prove a useful application to the cereals, the ash of
which is peculiarly rich in magnesia.

Many other saline substances have been tried as manures; but in most
instances on too limited a scale to permit any definite conclusions as
to their value. The experiments have also been too frequently performed
without the precautions necessary to exclude fallacy, so that the
results already arrived at must not be accepted as established facts,
but rather as indications of the direction in which further
investigation would be valuable. There is little doubt that many of
these substances might be usefully employed, if the conditions necessary
for their successful application were eliminated; and no subject is at
present more deserving of elucidation by careful and well-devised field
experiments.

_Phosphate of Lime._--The use of bones in their natural state as a
manure has been already adverted to, and it was stated, that though
their value depended mainly on the phosphates, the animal matters and
other substances contained in them were not without effect. The action
of phosphates is greatly promoted by solution in sulphuric acid, and the
application of the acid has brought into use many varieties of
phosphates of purely mineral origin, or which have been deprived of
their organic matters by artificial processes. Of these, the spent
animal charcoal of the sugar-refiners, usually containing about 70 per
cent of phosphates, and South American bone ash, are the most important.
The latter is now imported in very large quantity, and has the
composition shewn in the following analyses:--

Bone ash has hitherto been almost entirely consumed as a raw material
for the manufacture of superphosphates; but as it is sold at from L4:
10s. to L5: 10s. per ton when containing 70 per cent of phosphates, it
is, in reality, a very cheap source of these substances, and merits the
attention of the farmer as an application in its ordinary state.

Of strictly mineral phosphates, a considerable variety is now in use,
but they are employed exclusively in the manufacture of superphosphates,
as in their natural state they are so hard and insoluble, that the plant
is incapable of availing itself of them.

_Coprolites._--This name was originally applied by Dr. Buckland to
substances found in many geological strata, and which he believed to be
the dung of fossil animals. It has since been given to phosphatic
concretions found chiefly in the greensand in Suffolk and
Cambridgeshire, which are certainly not the same as those described by
Dr. Buckland, but consist of fragments of bones, ammonites, and other
fossils. Coprolites are now collected in very large quantities, and
about 43,000 tons are annually employed. They are extremely hard, and
require powerful machinery to reduce them to powder, and hence their
price is considerable, being about L2: 10s. per ton. Their composition
varies somewhat according to the care taken in selecting them, and the
locality from which they have been obtained. A general idea of their
composition may be derived from the subjoined analyses:--

Water                     1.95        1.90

Within the last two or three years, coprolites have been found in great
abundance in France, but they are of inferior quality, and rarely
contain more than 40 per cent of phosphates.

_Apatite_, or mineral phosphate of lime, is found in large deposits in
different places. It is particularly abundant in Spain, and occurs also
in America and Norway. From the latter country it has been imported to
some extent; and during the last year considerable quantities have been
brought from Spain, and the importations will undoubtedly increase very
largely as the means of transport improve in that country. Spanish
apatite contains--

Water                 0.80
Phosphate of lime    93.30
Carbonate of lime     0.50

Several other varieties of mineral phosphates have been imported under
the name of guano. The most important is Sombrero Island guano, which is
found on a small island in the Gulf of Mexico, where it occurs in a
layer said to be forty feet thick. It contains--

Water                            8.96
Phosphate of lime               37.71

                               100.00

A somewhat similar substance, but in hard crusts, has been imported,
under the names of Maracaybo guano, Pyroguanite, etc., which contains--

Water                                   1.03
Organic matter                          6.78

These substances are all excellent sources of phosphates, but they are
so hard that the plants cannot extract phosphoric acid from them, and
they are only useful when made soluble by chemical processes.

_Superphosphate; Dissolved Bones._--These names were at first applied to
bones which had been treated with sulphuric acid; but superphosphates
are now rarely made from bones alone, but bone ash and some of the
mineral phosphates just described are employed, either along with them,
or very frequently alone. The manufacture of superphosphates depends on
the existence of two different compounds of phosphoric acid and lime,
one of which contains three times as much lime as the other. That which
contains the larger quantity of lime is found in the bones and all other
natural phosphates, and is quite insoluble in water; but when two-thirds
of its lime are removed, it is converted into the other compound, which
is exceedingly soluble. This change is effected by the use of sulphuric
acid, which combines with two-thirds of the lime of the ordinary
insoluble phosphate of lime, and converts it into the _biphosphate of
lime_, which is soluble. When, therefore, we add to 100 lbs. of common
phosphate of lime the necessary quantity of sulphuric acid, it yields 64
lbs. of biphosphate, containing the whole of the phosphoric acid, which
is the valuable constituent, the diminution in weight being due to the
removal of the valueless lime. Hence it follows, also, that as the lime
so removed is converted into sulphate, there must, for every 100 lbs. of
phosphate of lime converted into biphosphate, be produced 87 lbs. of dry
sulphate of lime, or 110 of the ordinary sulphate called gypsum. This is
the minimum quantity which can be present, but in actual practice it is
liable to be greatly exceeded, more especially where coprolites are
used, owing to the large amount of carbonate of lime they contain, which
is also converted into sulphate by the action of the acid, so that it is
far from uncommon to find the gypsum twice as great as it would be if
materials free from carbonates could be obtained. By employing a
sufficiency of sulphuric acid, the whole quantity of phosphoric acid in
the bones may be thus brought into a soluble state, but in actual
practice it is found preferable to leave part of it in the insoluble
condition; as where it is entirely soluble, its effect is too great
during the early part of the season, and deficient at its end. In order
to dissolve bones, bone ash, or mineral phosphates, they are mixed with
from a third to half their weight of sulphuric acid, of specific gravity
1.70 or 140 deg. Twaddell. When mineral phosphates, and particularly
coprolites, are used, the quantity of sulphuric acid must be increased
so as to compensate for the loss of that which is consumed in
decomposing the carbonate of lime they contain. When operating on the
small scale, the materials are put into a vessel of wood, stone, or lead
(iron is to be avoided, as it is rapidly corroded by the acid), and
mixed with from a sixth to a fourth of their weight of water, which may
with advantage be used hot. The sulphuric acid is then added, and mixed
as uniformly as possible with the bones. Considerable effervescence
takes place, and the mass becomes extremely hot. At the end of two or
three days it is turned over with the spade, and after standing for some
days longer, generally becomes pretty dry. Should it still be too moist
to be sown, it must be again turned over, and mixed with some dry
substance to absorb the moisture. For this purpose everything containing
lime or its carbonate must be carefully avoided, as they bring back the
phosphates into the insoluble state, and undo what the sulphuric acid
has done. Peat, saw-dust, sand, decaying leaves, or similar substances,
will answer the purpose, and they should all be made thoroughly dry
before being used. An excellent plan is to sift the bones before
dissolving, to apply the acid to the coarser part, and afterwards to mix
in the fine dust which has passed through the sieve, to dry up the mass;
or a small quantity of bone ash, of good quality, or Peruvian guano, may
be used. On the large scale, mechanical arrangements are employed for
mixing the materials, so as to economise labour, and mineral phosphates,
such as apatite, can then be used with advantage. In such cases, blood,
sulphate of ammonia, soot, and other refuse matters, are occasionally
used to supply the requisite quantity of nitrogenous substances, but
large quantities are also made from bone ash, etc., without these
additions.

The composition of superphosphates must necessarily vary to a great
extent, and depends not only on the materials, but on the proportion of
acid used for solution. The following analysis illustrates the
composition of good samples made from different substances--

Superphosphates made from bones alone are generally distinguished by a
large quantity of ammonia, and a rather low per centage of biphosphate
of lime. This is owing to the difficulty experienced in making the acid
react in a satisfactory manner on bones, the phosphates being protected
from its action by the large quantity of animal matter which, when
moistened, swells up, fills the pores, and prevents the ready access of
the acid to the interior of the fragments. Superphosphates from
bone-ash, on the other hand, contain a mere trifle of ammonia, and when
well made a very large quantity of biphosphate of lime. Their quality
differs very greatly, and depends, of course, on that of the bone-ash
employed, which can rarely be obtained of quality sufficient to yield
more than 30 or 35 per cent of soluble phosphates. Coprolites are seldom
used alone for the manufacture of superphosphates, but are generally
mixed with bone-ash and bone dust. Mixtures containing salts of ammonia,
flesh, blood, etc., are also largely manufactured, and some are now
produced containing as much as four or five per cent of ammonia, and the
consumption of such articles is largely increasing.

The analyses above given are all those of good superphosphates, in which
abundance of acid has been used so as to convert a large proportion of
insoluble into soluble phosphates; but there are many samples of very
inferior quality to be met with in the market, in which the proportion
of acid has been reduced, and the quantity of phosphates made soluble is
consequently much lower than it ought to be. The following analyses
illustrate the composition of such manures, which are all very inferior
and generally worth much less than the price asked for them.

The deliberate adulteration of superphosphate, that is, the addition to
it of sand or similar worthless materials, I believe to be but little
practised. The most common fraud consists in selling as pure dissolved
bones, articles made in part, and sometimes almost entirely, from
coprolites. Occasionally refuse matters are used, but less with the
intention of actually diminishing the value of the manure as for the
purpose of acting as driers. It is said that sulphate of lime is
sometimes employed for this purpose, but this is rarely done, because
that substance is always a necessary constituent of superphosphate in
very large quantities; and as farmers look upon it with great suspicion,
all the efforts of the manufacturers are directed towards reducing its
quantity as much as possible. It is very commonly supposed by farmers
that the sulphate of lime found in so large quantity in all
superphosphates, and often amounting to as much as fifty per cent, has
been added to the materials in the process of manufacture, but this is a
mistake; it is a necessary and inevitable product of the chemical action
by which the phosphates are rendered soluble, although its quantity
depends on the materials from which the manure is made. When pure bones
are used its quantity is small, and it does not greatly exceed twice
that of the biphosphate of lime; but in a manure made from coprolites,
or other substances containing a large proportion of carbonate of lime,
which must in the process of manufacture be converted into sulphate, it
may be four or five times as much.

Although there is no manure which varies more in quality, or requires
greater vigilance on the part of the purchaser, in order to obtain a
good article, there is no doubt that superphosphates, owing to the
process of manufacture being better understood, and to increased
competition, have considerably improved in quality. Six or eight years
since a manure containing thirty per cent of phosphates, of which twelve
or fifteen had been converted into biphosphate, was considered a fair
sample, but now the proportion rendered soluble is greatly increased;
and where bone ash alone is employed, as much as thirty and even forty
per cent of soluble phosphates is occasionally found. This, of course,
is an exceptional case, and great attention and care in the selection of
materials are necessary to obtain so large a proportion. The analyses
already given will shew the farmer what he has to expect in good
superphosphates, but it is very necessary that he should take care to
obtain from the manufacturer a manure equal to the guarantee; and he
ought to bear in mind that, owing to the difficulty of getting materials
of constant composition, variations often take place to a considerable
extent in manures which are supposed to be made in exactly the same
manner.

_Phospho-Peruvian Guano._--Under this name a kind of superphosphate,
which is understood to be made by dissolving a native "rock guano," has

ingredients it contains, and the care taken to secure uniformity of
composition.

A variety of substances are sold under the name of nitrophosphate,
potato manure, cereal manure, etc. etc., which are all superphosphates,
differing only in the proportion of their ingredients, and in the
addition of small quantities of alkaline salts, sulphate of magnesia,
and other substances, but they present little difference from ordinary
superphosphates in their effects.

The use of superphosphate has greatly extended of late years, and its
consumption has increased in a greatly more rapid ratio than that of
guano or any other manure. Ten or twelve years since it was
comparatively little known, but it has now come to be used in many cases
in which Peruvian guano was formerly employed. It produces a better
effect than that manure on light soils, although in general a mixture of
the two answers better than either separately. When Peruvian guano is
to be applied along with it, the farmer will naturally select a
superphosphate made from bone ash, and containing the largest obtainable
quantity of soluble phosphates; but when it is to be used alone, it is
advisable to take one made from bones, or at all events one containing a
considerable quantity of nitrogenous matter or ammonia. The kind to be
selected must, however, be greatly dependent on the particular soil, and
the situation in which it is to be used.

_Lime._--Lime is by far the most important of the mineral manures, and
an almost indispensable agent of agricultural improvement. It has been
used as chalk, marl, shell and coral sand, ground limestone, and as
quick and slaked lime, and its action varies according as it is applied
in any of its natural forms, or after being burnt. In all of its native
forms the lime is combined with carbonic acid in the proportion of
fifty-six parts of lime to forty-four of carbonic acid, and the
carbonate is generally mixed with variable quantities of earthy
ingredients, which in some instances are important additions to it, and
affect its utility as a manure.

_Chalk_ is a very pure form of carbonate of lime, and where it abounds
has been largely employed as an application on the soil. It is dug out
