present only a few determinations are known), for which stars if amounts
to nearly two magnitudes. So much fainter is a red star on a
photographic plate than when observed with the eye.

_The difference between the photographic and the visual magnitudes is
called the colour-index (_c_)._ The correlation between this index and
the spectral-index is found to be rather high (_r_ = +0.96). In L. M.
II, 19 I have deduced the following tables giving the spectral-type
corresponding to a given colour-index, and inversely.

From each catalogue of visual magnitudes of the stars we may obtain
their photographic magnitude through adding the colour-index. This may
be considered as known (taking into account the high coefficient of
correlation between _s_ and _c_) as soon as we know the spectral type of
the star. We may conclude directly that the number of stars having a
photographic magnitude brighter than 6.0 is considerably smaller than
the number of stars visually brighter than this magnitude. There are,
indeed, 4701 stars for which _m_ < 6.0 and 2874 stars having _m'_ < 6.0.


16. _Radial velocity of the stars._ From the values of [alpha] and
[delta] at different times we obtain the components of the proper
motions of the stars perpendicular to the line of sight. The third
component (_W_), in the radial direction, is found by the DOPPLER
principle, through measuring the displacement of the lines in the
spectrum, this displacement being towards the red or the violet
according as the star is receding from or approaching the observer.

The velocity _W_ will be expressed in siriometers per stellar year
(sir./st.) and alternately also in km./sec. The rate of conversion of
these units is given in Sec.5.


17. Summing up the remarks here given on the apparent attributes of the
stars we find them referred to the following principal groups:--

I. _The position of the stars_ is here generally given in galactic
longitude (_l_) and latitude (_b_). Moreover their equatorial
coordinates ([alpha] and [delta]) are given in an abridged notation
([alpha][delta]), where the first four numbers give the right ascension
in hours and minutes and the last two numbers give the declination in
degrees, the latter being printed in italics if the declination is
negative.

Eventually the position is given in galactic squares, as defined in Sec.2.

II. _The apparent motion of the stars_ will be given in radial
components (_W_) expressed in sir./st. and their motion perpendicular to
the line of sight. These components will be expressed in one component
(_u_0_) parallel to the galactic plane, and one component (_v_0_)
perpendicular to it. If the distance (_r_) is known we are able to
convert these components into components of the linear velocity
perpendicular to the line of sight (_U_ and _V_).

III. _The intensity of the light_ of the stars is expressed in
magnitudes. We may distinguish between the _apparent_ magnitude (_m_)
and the _absolute_ magnitude (_M_), the latter being equal to the value
of the apparent magnitude supposing the star to be situated at a
distance of one siriometer.

The apparent magnitude may be either the _photographic_ magnitude
(_m'_), obtained from a photographic plate, or the _visual_ magnitude
(_m_) obtained with the eye.

The difference between these magnitudes is called the _colour-index_
(_c_ = _m'_-_m_).

IV. _The characteristics of the stellar radiation_ are the mean
wave-length ([lambda]_0) and the dispersion ([sigma]) in the
wave-length. _The mean wave-length_ may be either directly determined
(perhaps as _effective_ wave-length) or found from the spectral type
(spectral index) or from the colour-index.

There are in all eight attributes of the stars which may be found from
the observations:--the spherical position of the star (_l_, _b_), its
distance (_r_), proper motion (_u_0_ and _v_0_), radial velocity (_W_),
apparent magnitude (_m_ or _m'_), absolute magnitude (_M_), spectral
type (_Sp_) or spectral index (_s_), and colour-index (_c_). Of these
the colour-index, the spectral type, the absolute magnitude and also (to
a certain degree) the radial velocity may be considered as independent
of the place of the observer and may therefore be considered not as only
apparent but also as _absolute_ attributes of the stars.

Between three of these attributes (_m_, _M_ and _r_) a mathematical
relation exists so that one of them is known as soon as the other two
have been found from observations.

CHAPTER II.

SOURCES OF OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE STARS.


18. In this chapter I shall give a short account of the publications in
which the most complete information on the attributes of the stars may
be obtained, with short notices of the contents and genesis of these
publications. It is, however, not my intention to give a history of
these researches. We shall consider more particularly the questions
relating to the position of the stars, their motion, magnitude, and
spectra.


19. _Place of the stars._ _Durchmusterungs._ The most complete data on
the position of the stars are obtained from the star catalogues known as
"Durchmusterungs". There are two such catalogues, which together cover
the whole sky, one--visual--performed in Bonn and called the _Bonner
Durchmusterung_ (B. D.), the other--photographic--performed in Cape _The
Cape Photographic Durchmusterung_ (C. P. D.). As the first of these
catalogues has long been--and is to some extent even now--our principal
source for the study of the sky and is moreover the first enterprise of
this kind, I shall give a somewhat detailed account of its origin and
contents, as related by ARGELANDER in the introduction to the B. D.

B. D. was planned and performed by the Swedish-Finn ARGELANDER (born in
Memel 1799). A scholar of BESSEL he was first called as director in Abo,
then in Haelsingfors, and from there went in 1836 to Bonn, where in the
years 1852 to 1856 he performed this great _Durchmusterung_. As
instrument he used a FRAUENHOFER comet-seeker with an aperture of 76 mm,
a focal length of 650 mm, and 10 times magnifying power. The field of
sight had an extension of 6 deg..

In the focus of the objective was a semicircular piece of thin glass,
with the edge (= the diameter of the semicircle) parallel to the circle
of declination. This edge was sharply ground, so that it formed a
narrow dark line perceptible at star illumination. Perpendicular to this
diameter (the "hour-line") were 10 lines, at each side of a middle line,
drawn at a distance of 7'. These lines were drawn with black oil colour
on the glass.

The observations are performed by the observer A and his assistant B. A
is in a dark room, lies on a chair having the eye at the ocular and can
easily look over 2 deg. in declination. The assistant sits in the room
below, separated by a board floor, at the _Thiede_ clock.

From the beginning of the observations the declination circle is fixed
at a certain declination (whole degrees). All stars passing the field at
a distance smaller than one degree from the middle line are observed.
Hence the name "Durchmusterung". When a star passes the "hour line" the
magnitude is called out by A, and noted by B together with the time of
the clock. Simultaneously the declination is noted by A in the darkness.
On some occasions 30 stars may be observed in a minute.

The first observation was made on Febr. 25, 1852, the last on March 27,
1859. In all there were 625 observation nights with 1841 "zones". The
total number of stars was 324198.

The catalogue was published by ARGELANDER in three parts in the years
1859, 1861 and 1862[7] and embraces all stars between the pole and 2 deg.
south of the equator brighter than 9m.5, according to the scale of
ARGELANDER (his aim was to register all stars up to the 9th magnitude).
To this scale we return later. The catalogue is arranged in accordance
with the declination-degrees, and for each degree according to the right
ascension. Quotations from B. D. have the form B. D. 23 deg..174, which
signifies: Zone +23 deg., star No. 174.

ARGELANDER's work was continued for stars between [delta] = -2 deg. and
[delta] = -23 deg. by SCHOeNFELD, according to much the same plan, but with a
larger instrument (aperture 159 mm, focal length 1930 mm, magnifying
power 26 times). The observations were made in the years 1876 to 1881
and include 133659 stars.[8]

The positions in B. D. are given in tenths of a second in right
ascension and in tenths of a minute in declination.


20. _The Cape Photographic Durchmusterung_[9] (C. P. D.). This embraces
the whole southern sky from -18 deg. to the south pole. Planned by GILL, the
photographs were taken at the Cape Observatory with a DALLMEYER lens
with 15 cm. aperture and a focal-length of 135 cm. Plates of 30 x 30 cm.
give the coordinates for a surface of 5 x 5 square degrees. The
photographs were taken in the years 1885 to 1890. The measurements of
the plates were made by KAPTEYN in Groningen with a "parallactic"
measuring-apparatus specially constructed for this purpose, which
permits of the direct obtaining of the right ascension and the
declination of the stars. The measurements were made in the years 1886
to 1898. The catalogue was published in three parts in the years 1896 to
1900.

The positions have the same accuracy as in B. D. The whole number of
stars is 454875. KAPTEYN considers the catalogue complete to at least
the magnitude 9m.2.

In the two great catalogues B. D. and C. P. D. we have all stars
registered down to the magnitude 9.0 (visually) and a good way below
this limit. Probably as far as to 10m.

A third great Durchmusterung has for some time been in preparation at
Cordoba in Argentina.[10] It continues the southern zones of SCHOeNFELD
and is for the present completed up to 62 deg. southern declination.

All these Durchmusterungs are ultimately based on star catalogues of
smaller extent and of great precision. Of these catalogues we shall not
here speak (Compare, however, Sec.23).

A great "Durchmusterung", that will include all stars to the 11th
magnitude, has for the last thirty years been in progress at different
observatories proposed by the congress in Paris, 1888. The observations
proceed very irregularly, and there is little prospect of getting the
work finished in an appreciable time.


21. _Star charts._ For the present we possess two great photographic
star charts, embracing the whole heaven:--The _Harvard Map_ (H. M.) and
the _FRANKLIN-ADAMS Charts_ (F. A. C.).

_The Harvard Map_, of which a copy (or more correctly two copies) on
glass has kindly been placed at the disposal of the Lund Observatory by
Mr. PICKERING, embraces all stars down to the 11th magnitude. It
