THE MOVEMENTS OF PLANTS.



INTRODUCTION.

THE chief object of the present work is to describe and connect together
several large classes of movement, common to almost all plants. The most
widely prevalent movement is essentially of the same nature as that of the
stem of a climbing plant, which bends successively to all points of the
compass, so that the tip revolves. This movement has been called by Sachs
"revolving nutation;" but we have found it much more convenient to use the
terms circumnutation and circumnutate. As we shall have to say much about
this movement, it will be useful here briefly to describe its nature. If we
observe a circumnutating stem, which happens at the time to be bent, we
will say towards the north, it will be found gradually to bend more and
more easterly, until it faces the east; and so onwards to the south, then
to the west, and back again to the north. If the movement had been quite
regular, the apex would have described a circle, or rather, as the stem is
always growing upwards, a circular spiral. But it generally describes
irregular elliptical or oval figures; for the apex, after pointing in any
one direction, commonly moves back to the opposite side, not, however,
returning along the same line. Afterwards other irregular ellipses or ovals
are successively described, with their longer
[page 2]
axes directed to different points of the compass. Whilst describing such
figures, the apex often travels in a zigzag line, or makes small
subordinate loops or triangles. In the case of leaves the ellipses are
generally narrow.

Until recently the cause of all such bending movements was believed to be
due to the increased growth of the side which becomes for a time convex;
that this side does temporarily grow more quickly than the concave side has
been well established; but De Vries has lately shown that such increased
growth follows a previously increased state of turgescence on the convex
side.* In the case of parts provided with a so-called joint, cushion or
pulvinus, which consists of an aggregate of small cells that have ceased to
increase in size from a very early age, we meet with similar movements; and
here, as Pfeffer has shown** and as we shall see in the course of this
work, the increased turgescence of the cells on opposite sides is not
followed by increased growth. Wiesner denies in certain cases the accuracy
of De Vries' conclusion about turgescence, and maintains*** that the
increased extensibility of the cell-walls is the more important element.
That such extensibility must accompany increased turgescence in order that
the part may bend is manifest, and this has been insisted on by several
botanists; but in the case of unicellular plants it can hardly fail to be
the more important element. On the whole we may at present conclude that
in-

connection between turgescence and growth. For De Vries' interesting essay,

[page 3]
creased growth, first on one side and then on another, is a secondary
effect, and that the increased turgescence of the cells, together with the
extensibility of their walls, is the primary cause of the movement of
circumnutation.*

In the course of the present volume it will be shown that apparently every
growing part of every plant is continually circumnutating, though often on
a small scale. Even the stems of seedlings before they have broken through
the ground, as well as their buried radicles, circumnutate, as far as the
pressure of the surrounding earth permits. In this universally present
movement we have the basis or groundwork for the acquirement, according to
the requirements of the plant, of the most diversified movements. Thus, the
great sweeps made by the stems of twining plants, and by the tendrils of
other climbers, result from a mere increase in the amplitude of the
ordinary movement of circumnutation. The position which young leaves and
other organs ultimately assume is acquired by the circumnutating movement
being increased in some one direction. the leaves of various plants are
said to sleep at night, and it will be seen that their blades then assume a
vertical position through modified circumnutation, in order to protect
their upper surfaces from being chilled through radiation.  The movements
of various organs to the light, which are so general throughout the
vegetable kingdom, and occasionally from the light, or transversely with
respect to it, are all modified

* See Mr. Vines' excellent discussion ('Arbeiten des Bot. Instituts in
Würzburg,' B. II. pp. 142, 143, 1878) on this intricate subject.
Hofmeister's observations ('Jahreschrifte des Vereins für Vaterl.
Naturkunde in Würtemberg,' 1874, p. 211) on the curious movements of
Spirogyra, a plant consisting of a single row of cells, are valuable in
relation to this subject.

[page 4]
forms of circumnutation; as again are the equally prevalent movements of
stems, etc., towards the zenith, and of roots towards the centre of the
earth. In accordance with these conclusions, a considerable difficulty in
the way of evolution is in part removed, for it might have been asked, how
did all these diversified movements for the most different purposes first
arise? As the case stands, we know that there is always movement in
progress, and its amplitude, or direction, or both, have only to be
modified for the good of the plant in relation with internal or external
stimuli.

Besides describing the several modified forms of circumnutation, some other
subjects will be discussed. The two which have interested us most are,
firstly, the fact that with some seedling plants the uppermost part alone
is sensitive to light, and transmits an influence to the lower part,
causing it to bend. If therefore the upper part be wholly protected from
light, the lower part may be exposed for hours to it, and yet does not
become in the least bent, although this would have occurred quickly if the
upper part had been excited by light. Secondly, with the radicles of
seedlings, the tip is sensitive to various stimuli, especially to very
slight pressure, and when thus excited, transmits an influence to the upper
part, causing it to bend from the pressed side. On the other hand, if the
tip is subjected to the vapour of water proceeding from one side, the upper
part of the radicle bends towards this side. Again it is the tip, as stated
by Ciesielski, though denied by others, which is sensitive to the
attraction of gravity, and by transmission causes the adjoining parts of
the radicle to bend towards the centre of the earth. These several cases of
the effects of contact, other irritants, vapour, light, and the
[page 5]
attraction of gravity being transmitted from the excited part for some
little distance along the organ in question, have an important bearing on
the theory of all such movements.

[Terminology.--A brief explanation of some terms which will be used, must
here be given. With seedlings, the stem which supports the cotyledons (i.e.
the organs which represent the first leaves) has been called by many
botanists the hypocotyledonous stem, but for brevity sake we will speak of
it merely as the hypocotyl: the stem immediately above the cotyledons will
be called the epicotyl or plumule. The radicle can be distinguished from
the hypocotyl only by the presence of root-hairs and the nature of its
covering. The meaning of the word circumnutation has already been
explained. Authors speak of positive and negative heliotropism,*--that is,
the bending of an organ to or from the light; but it is much more
convenient to confine the word heliotropism to bending towards the light,
and to designate as apheliotropism bending from the light. There is another
reason for this change, for writers, as we have observed, occasionally drop
the adjectives positive and negative, and thus introduce confusion into
their discussions. Diaheliotropism may express a position more or less
transverse to the light and induced by it. In like manner positive
geotropism, or bending towards the centre of the earth, will be called by
us geotropism; apogeotropism will mean bending in opposition to gravity or
from the centre of the earth; and diageotropism, a position more or less
transverse to the radius of the earth. The words heliotropism and
geotropism properly mean the act of moving in relation to the light or the
earth; but in the same manner as gravitation, though defined as "the act of
tending to the centre," is often used to express the cause of a body
falling, so it will be found convenient occasionally to employ heliotropism
and geotropism, etc., as the cause of the movements in question.

The term epinasty is now often used in Germany, and implies that the upper
surface of an organ grows more quickly than the

* The highly useful terms of Heliotropism and Geotropism were first used by
Dr. A. B. Frank: see his remarkable 'Beiträge zur Pflanzenphysiologie,'
1868.
[page 6]
lower surface, and thus causes it to bend downwards. Hyponasty is the
reverse, and implies increased growth along the lower surface, causing the
part to bend upwards.*

Methods of Observation.--The movements, sometimes very small and sometimes
considerable in extent, of the various organs observed by us, were traced
in the manner which after many trials we found to be best, and which must
be described. Plants growing in pots were protected wholly from the light,
or had light admitted from above, or on one side as the case might require,
and were covered above by a large horizontal sheet of glass, and with
another vertical sheet on one side. A glass filament, not thicker than a
horsehair, and from a quarter to three-quarters of an inch in length, was
affixed to the part to be observed by means of shellac dissolved in
alcohol. The solution was allowed to evaporate, until it became so thick
that it set hard in two or three seconds, and it never injured the tissues,
even the tips of tender radicles, to which it was applied. To the end of
the glass filament an excessively minute bead of black sealing-wax was
cemented, below or behind which a bit of card with a black dot was fixed to
a stick driven into the ground. The weight of the filament was so slight
that even small leaves were not perceptibly pressed down. another method of
observation, when much magnification of the movement was not required, will
presently be described. The bead and the dot on the card were viewed
through the horizontal or vertical glass-plate (according to the position
of the object), and when one exactly covered the other, a dot was made on
the glass-plate with a sharply pointed stick dipped in thick Indian-ink.
Other dots were made at short intervals of time and these were afterwards
joined by straight lines. The figures thus traced were therefore angular;
but if dots had been made every 1 or 2 minutes, the lines would have been
more curvilinear, as occurred when radicles were allowed to trace their own
courses on smoked glass-plates. To make the dots accurately was the sole
difficulty, and required some practice. Nor could this be done quite
accurately, when the movement was much magnified, such as 30 times and
upwards; yet even in this case the general course may be trusted. To test
the accuracy of the above method of observation, a filament was fixed to an

* These terms are used in the sense given them by De Vries, 'Würzburg
Arbeiten,' Heft ii 1872, p. 252.

[page 7]
inanimate object which was made to slide along a straight edge and dots
were repeatedly made on a glass-plate; when these were joined, the result
ought to have been a perfectly straight line, and the line was very nearly
straight. It may be added that when the dot on the card was placed
half-an-inch below or behind the bead of sealing-wax, and when the
glass-plate (supposing it to have been properly curved) stood at a distance
of 7 inches in front (a common distance), then the tracing represented the
movement of the bead magnified 15 times.

Whenever a great increase of the movement was not required, another, and in
some respects better, method of observation was followed. This consisted in
fixing two minute triangles of thin paper, about 1/20 inch in height, to
the two ends of the attached glass filament; and when their tips were
brought into a line so that they covered one another, dots were made as
before on the glass-plate. If we suppose the glass-plate to stand at a
distance of seven inches from the end of the shoot bearing the filament,
the dots when joined, will give nearly the same figure as if a filament
seven inches long, dipped in ink, had been fixed to the moving shoot, and
had inscribed its own course on the plate. The movement is thus
considerably magnified; for instance, if a shoot one inch in length were
bending, and the glass-plate stood at the distance of seven inches, the
movement would be magnified eight times. It would, however, have been very
difficult to have ascertained in each case how great a length of the shoot
was bending; and this is indispensable for ascertaining the degree to which
the movement is magnified.

After dots had been made on the glass-plates by either of the above
methods, they were copied on tracing paper and joined by ruled lines, with
arrows showing the direction of the movement. The nocturnal courses are
represented by straight broken lines. the first dot is always made larger
than the others, so as to catch the eye, as may be seen in the diagrams.
The figures on the glass-plates were often drawn on too large a scale to be
reproduced on the pages of this volume, and the proportion in which they
have been reduced is always given.* Whenever it could be approximately told
how much the movement had been magnified, this is stated. We have perhaps

* We are much indebted to Mr. Cooper for the care with which he has reduced
and engraved our diagrams.

[page 8]
introduced a superfluous number of diagrams; but they take up less space
than a full description of the movements. Almost all the sketches of plants
asleep, etc., were carefully drawn for us by Mr. George Darwin.

As shoots, leaves, etc., in circumnutating bend more and more, first in one
direction and then in another, they were necessarily viewed at different
times more or less obliquely; and as the dots were made on a flat surface,
the apparent amount of movement is exaggerated according to the degree of
obliquity of the point of view. It would, therefore, have been a much
better plan to have used hemispherical glasses, if we had possessed them of
all sizes, and if the bending part of the shoot had been distinctly hinged
and could have been placed so as to have formed one of the radii of the
sphere. But even in this case it would have been necessary afterwards to
have projected the figures on paper; so that complete accuracy could not
have been attained. From the distortion of our figures, owing to the above
causes, they are of no use to any one who wishes to know the exact amount
of movement, or the exact course pursued; but they serve excellently for
ascertaining whether or not the part moved at all, as well as the general
character of the movement.]

In the following chapters, the movements of a considerable number of plants
are described; and the species have been arranged according to the system
adopted by Hooker in Le Maout and Decaisne's 'Descriptive Botany.' No one
who is not investigating the present subject need read all the details,
which, however, we have thought it advisable to give. To save the reader
trouble, the conclusions and most of the more important parts have been
printed in larger type than the other parts. He may, if he thinks fit, read
the last chapter first, as it includes a summary of the whole volume; and
he will thus see what points interest him, and on which he requires the
full evidence.

Finally, we must have the pleasure of returning our
[page 9]
sincere thanks to Sir Joseph Hooker and to Mr. W. Thiselton Dyer for their
great kindness, in not only sending us plants from Kew, but in procuring
others from several sources when they were required for our observations;
also, for naming many species, and giving us information on various points.

THE CIRCUMNUTATING MOVEMENTS OF SEEDLING PLANTS.

Brassica oleracea, circumnutation of the radicle, of the arched hypocotyl
whilst still buried beneath the ground, whilst rising above the ground and
straightening itself, and when erect--Circumnutation of the cotyledons--
Rate of movement--Analogous observations on various organs in species of
Githago, Gossypium, Oxalis, Tropaeolum, Citrus, Aesculus, of several
Leguminous and Cucurbitaceous genera, Opuntia, Helianthus, Primula,
Cyclamen, Stapelia, Cerinthe, Nolana, Solanum, Beta, Ricinus, Quercus,

Nephrodium, and Selaginella.

THE following chapter is devoted to the circumnutating movements of the
radicles, hypocotyls, and cotyledons of seedling plants; and, when the
cotyledons do not rise above the ground, to the movements of the epicotyl.
But in a future chapter we shall have to recur to the movements of certain
cotyledons which sleep at night.

[Brassica oleracea (Cruciferae)'.--Fuller details will be given with
respect to the movements in this case than in any other, as space and time
will thus ultimately be saved.

Radicle.--A seed with the radicle projecting .05 inch was fastened with
shellac to a little plate of zinc, so that the radicle stood up vertically;
and a fine glass filament was then fixed near its base, that is, close to
the seed-coats. The seed was surrounded by little bits of wet sponge, and
the movement of the bead at the end of the filament was traced (Fig. 1)
during sixty hours. In this time the radicle increased in length from .05
to .11 inch. Had the filament been attached at first close to the apex of
the radicle, and if it could have remained there all the time, the movement
exhibited would have
[page 11]
been much greater, for at the close of our observations the tip, instead of
standing vertically upwards, had become bowed downwards through geotropism,
so as almost to touch the zinc plate. As far as we could roughly ascertain
by measurements made with compasses on other seeds, the tip alone, for a
length of only 2/100 to 3/100 of an inch, is acted on by geotropism. But
the tracing shows that the basal part of the radicle continued to
circumnutate irregularly during the whole time. The actual extreme amount
of movement of the bead at the end of the filament was nearly .05 inch, but
to what extent the movement of the radicle was magnified by the filament,
which was nearly 3/4 inch in length, it was impossible to estimate.

Another seed was treated and observed in the same manner, but the radicle
in this case protruded .1 inch, and was not

fastened so as to project quite vertically upwards. The filament was
affixed close to its base. The tracing (Fig. 2, reduced by half) shows the
movement from 9 A.M. Jan. 31st to 7 A.M. Feb. 2nd; but it continued to move
during the whole of the

2nd in the same general direction, and in a similar zigzag manner. From the
radicle not being quite perpendicular when the filament was affixed
geotropism came into play at once; but the irregular zigzag course shows
that there was growth (probably preceded by turgescence), sometimes on one
and sometimes on another side. Occasionally the bead remained stationary
for about an hour, and then probably growth occurred on the side opposite
to that which caused the geotropic curvature. In the case previously
