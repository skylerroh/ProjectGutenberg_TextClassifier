Allan Poe. I believe that Poe was perhaps the first to employ this
adjective in the modern sense of eerie or uncanny or bizarre; but
you will find it used in older writers, such as Shakespeare, with
a special application to witchcraft or sorcery. The three Fates
of classic mythology were spoken of as 'the weird sisters,' and
the root-meaning of the word has reference to fate or destiny. As
a noun, it is still sometimes used in the latter sense; and it also
means a prediction of prophecy. The word itself is of Anglo-Saxon
origin, and is related to the old German _wurt_ and Icelandic
_urdhr_."--Clark Ashton Smith

In my filler concerning the origin of the word "weird," you will
remember that I said that its meaning the bizarre originated with
Edgar Allen Poe. I had in mind the other meanings as I wrote it.
Undoubtedly, if Edgar Allan Poe had not used it, the word would not be
popular today.

"I had intended to write since I received the first copy of TFF, but
circumstances made it impossible. I wish to compliment you on the
magazine. It is not perfect, of course--But it is different and that
is a blessing indeed."--Louis C. Smith
