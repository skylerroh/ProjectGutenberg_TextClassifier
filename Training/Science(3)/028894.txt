 The Computer could do no wrong. Then it was asked
 a simple little question by a simple little man.


The little man had a head like an old-fashioned light bulb and a smile
that seemed to say he had secrets from the rest of the world. He didn't
talk much, just an occasional "Oh," "Mm" or "Ah." Krayton figured he
must be all right, though. After all he'd been sent to Computer City by
the Information Department itself, and his credentials must have been
checked in a hundred ways and places.
