Letters from Prominent Educators.


    "I consider the treatment of the subject the most sane and
    practical that I know of, and therefore feel that I can
    conscientiously recommend the book most heartily. There is no
    subject so much hampered by ignorance, misconception and
    prejudice as that with which the book deals. I am sure the
    treatment of the matter will result in a more wholesome and
    healthful conception of the entire subject."--=Dr. Henry F.
    Kallenberg, The Institute and Training School of Young Men's
    Christian Associations.=

    "Chapter four naturally brings everything to a practical focus
    and seems to me admirable. Chapter five, too, impressed me as
    very useful. The topical questions and their answers in the
    appendix was a very happy thought and adds materially to the
    value of the book."--=Dr. G. Stanley Hall, President Clark
    University.=

    "I have gone through the book carefully and I am greatly pleased
    with it. I think it is admirably adapted to the needs and
    temperament of college men, and possibly all men. The topics
    discussed are of prime importance and interest for young men,
    the method of presentation is in all respects commendable, and
    the style is practical and concrete. The book ought to find its
    way into the hands of a great many young men. It should be in
    the hands of fathers and even mothers who have sons in the
    adolescent period."--=Prof. M.V. O'Shea, University of
    Wisconsin.=

    "I have no hesitancy in saying that it is by far the best
    presentation of this very important subject that I have ever
    seen. It answers many important questions for which I have seen
    no answer elsewhere."--=Prof. William R. Manning, Purdue
    University.=

    "I have heard the lecture and read the book and do not hesitate
    to recommend it. It is all that a young man needs to read to
    inform him of his duties and his perils in this matter. The
    ethical ideals are high and the advice sensible and wise."--=Dr.
    Charles R. Henderson, Department of Sociology, University of
    Chicago.=

    "Some day Sexual Hygiene will have a place in the curriculum of
    every college. It is a subject that every college man does
    consider in one way or another, but often ignorantly, or under
    unwise guidance. Dr. Hall's book is so simple and sane as well
    as scientific, that I wish it might be in the hands of every
    college man in the country."--=Dr. George A. Coe, Northwestern
    University.=

    "I consider it admirable in both conception and execution. So
    far as I know, it is unique in its presentation of these
    matters, especially on the hygienic side and shall be pleased to
    recommend it at every opportunity."--=Dr. William T. Belfield,
    Bush Medical College, University of Chicago.=

    "The book seems to me calculated to be very useful, and should
    be in the hands of a large number of college
    undergraduates."--=Dr. Isaac Sharpless, President Haverford
    College.=

    "I have read the book and had other priests read it and all
    concur in my opinion that it is destined to become a powerful
    auxiliary to our young men in their struggle for a purer life.
    The language is not vague, but to the point, and every young man
    will understand it."--=Rev. A.M. Kirsch, University of Notre
    Dame.=

    "I have the strongest praise for the book as a whole--the
    biological foundation, directness, freedom from cant and prudery
    and the practical way in which the author gets to the level of
    his readers."--=Dr. C. Judson Herrick, Denison University,
    Ohio.=

    "I have read Dr. Hall's book with the keenest curiosity and
    interest. Why could not such a book have been in the hands of
    the youth of the past generations? We should have been all the
    better for it. The work seems to me to be simply and plainly
    stated. With such apparent thoroughness and good sense, good
    taste, I am sure the book will commend itself to every
    thoughtful reader."-=-Dr. Chas. M. Stuart, Garrett Biblical
    Institute, Evanston, Illinois.=

        To the YOUNG MAN, who is
        devoting years of his life to
        secure the HIGHEST DEGREE OF
        DEVELOPMENT of those powers
        of BODY and MIND that are to
        be HIS INSTRUMENTS in solving
        LIFE'S PROBLEMS, this little
        volume is DEDICATED in the
        spirit of FRATERNITY.

PREFACE TO SIXTH EDITION.


The cordial reception given to this little book by the medical
profession, by educators, and especially by the young men of the
country, have by their demands for the book necessitated the
appearance of new editions in such rapid succession that no
far-reaching changes in the text have been possible even if they had
been needed. Happily, no extensive changes have been required.

In the second edition several corrections, typographical and verbal,
were made and additions made to the appendix. To the third edition the
chapter on Development was added. The fourth and fifth editions
received verbal changes here and added paragraphs there.

The sixth edition differs from the fifth in the addition of the
author's portrait as a frontispiece, the addition of an answered
question to the appendix and the listing of certain lecture topics,
with press notices and letters.

The book seems to be meeting a demand for accurate information briefly
and clearly stated.

FOREWORD.


Several years ago the author was asked by his students to present to
them some of the facts of Sexual Physiology and Hygiene. The plea of
"not a specialist in that line" was not accepted; so after a few weeks
devoted to a careful study of the literature the subject was
presented. It seemed to be acceptable, and other invitations followed
in successive years not only from the author's own institution but
from many others.

In the last few years the subject has been presented at all of the
leading institutions of learning in the middle west--at some of them
several times and always to large audiences.

In response to repeated requests for "a book" the author has finally
prepared this brief volume in which he has endeavored to present a
difficult subject in the true university spirit, frankly calling
things by their right names, always keeping in close accord with the
latest researches.

It is hoped that the chapter on Hygiene will in itself be a
justification for the book.
