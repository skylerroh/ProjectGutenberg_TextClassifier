TYPE-METAL RELIEF PLATES.
A SUPERIOR SUBSTITUTE FOR WOOD-CUTS
AT MUCH LOWER PRICES.

Persons desiring illustrations for Books, Newspapers, Catalogues,
Advertisements, or for any other purposes, can have their work done by
us promptly and in the best style.

OUR RELIEF PLATES are engraved by photo-chemical means; are mounted on
blocks type-high ready for use on any ordinary press, and will wear
longer than the common stereotype plates.

They have a perfectly smooth printing surface, and the lines are _as
deep, as even,_ and _as sharp_ as they could possibly be cut by hand.

ELECTROTYPES may be made from them in the same manner as from
wood-cuts.

COPY. The engraving is done either from prints or pen-drawings. Almost
all kinds of prints can be re-engraved directly from the copy,
provided they be in _clear, black lines_ or stipple, and on _white_ or
only slightly tinted paper.

Pen drawings, suitable for engraving by us, must be made with
_thoroughly_ BLACK ink, on _smooth, white_ paper. They should usually
be made twice the length and twice the width of the plates desired.

When such drawings cannot be furnished us, we can produce them from
photographs, pencil sketches, or designs of any kind accompanied with
proper instructions. Photographs taken in the usual way, and of any
convenient size, we can use.

CHANGE OF SIZE.--Wood-cut prints of the coarser kind may often be
reduced to half their lineal dimensions, while others will admit of
very little reduction, and some of none at all.

Most lithographic and steel-plate prints will admit of no reduction.

Very fine prints of any kind may be _enlarged_ moderately without
detriment.

Any prints which cannot be satisfactorily reduced or enlarged may be
_redrawn_ and thus brought to any desired size.

In all cases of reduction and enlargement, the relative proportions
remain unchanged.

PROOFS.--Whenever desired, we will furnish tintype proofs of the
drawings made by us, for approval or correction, before engraving. A
printed proof is furnished with each plate.

TIME.--We cannot usually engage to fill an order for a single plate in
less than from three to six days; larger orders will require longer
time.

ESTIMATES will be promptly furnished when desired. That these may be
definite and correct, the copy to be used--whether print, photograph,
sketch, or drawing--should always be submitted for our examination,
together with a distinct statement of the size of plate wanted, and of
any other details to be observed.

TERMS.--To insure attention, all orders must be accompanied by an
advance of half the price charged, the balance to be paid on delivery.

ELECTROTYPING AND PRINTING.--We have recently added to our
establishment excellent facilities for making electrotypes, and also
three power presses specially fitted for printing plates of all sizes
in the finest manner.

ARTIFICIAL LIGHT.--We have just introduced this most important
facility, which enables us to prosecute our work _in cloudy weather_,
and to push forward hurried orders _in the night_.

REFERENCES.--Our plates are now used by the principal publishers in
this city, and by most of the leading houses in every State in the
Union.

OUR GENERAL CIRCULAR contains a few specimens of the various kinds of
our work, and will be sent on receipt of stamp. We have just prepared
five special circulars, as follows:

  No. 1.   Portraits and Figures.
  No. 2.   Buildings and Landscapes.
