
Colonel Meadows and several MPs who were stationed in the wings came out
and dragged him from the platform.

The G.I. audience remained silent a moment longer, then broke into loud,
nervous rumbling. Seconds later Colonel Meadows returned to the
microphone and held up his hand until the confusion died down. He
explained briefly about Dr. Shalt's experiment and how Crawford had been
asked to participate. He told how a human voice had been sent to Mars
for the first time and how Crawford had suffered a temporary shock on
hearing his voice return from this journey.

He assured the audience that Crawford would receive the best medical
care and would probably be back performing at the field in a few short
weeks. He asked the soldiers to remain in their seats and let the show
continue out of respect for a great performer.

The orchestra began the refrain of a popular song and the guest vocalist
appeared wearing a white strapless evening gown. She blew warm, friendly
kisses to the soldiers. The response she received was a healthy one.

And the show went on....
