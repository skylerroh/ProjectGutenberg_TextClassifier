bandana. Briskly, he snapped a tall ten-gallon hat on his head, and
stepped to the Time Door.

Gripping an ebony handle, he tugged upward. The huge metal door oiled
slowly back. "Time," said Cydwick Ohms simply, gesturing toward the gray
nothingness beyond the door.

The reporters and photographers surged forward, notebooks and cameras at
the ready. "What if the door swings shut after you're gone?" one of them
asked.

"A groundless fear, boy," assured Ohms. "I have seen to it that the Time
Door can never be closed. And now--good-bye, gentlemen. Or, to use the
proper colloquialism--_so long, hombres!_"

Ohms bowed from the waist, gave his ten-gallon hat a final tug, and took
a single step forward.

And did _not_ disappear.

He stood, blinking. Then he swore, beat upon the unyielding wall of
grayness with clenched fists, and fell back, panting, to his desk.

"I've failed!" he moaned in a lost voice. "The C. Cydwick Ohms Time Door
is a botch!" He buried his head in trembling hands.

The reporters and photographers began to file out.

Suddenly the professor raised his head. "_Listen!_" he warned.

A slow rumbling, muted with distance, emanated from the dense grayness
of the Time Door. Faint yips and whoopings were distinct above the
rumble. The sounds grew steadily--to a thousand beating drums--to a
rolling sea of thunder!

Shrieking, the reporters and photographers scattered for the stairs.

Ah, another knotty problem to be solved, mused Professor Cydwick Ohms,
swinging, with some difficulty, onto one of three thousand Texas steers
stampeding into the laboratory.
