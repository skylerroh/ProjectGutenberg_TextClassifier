fore-arm;) the _Car'pus_, (wrist;) the _Met-a-car'pus_, (palm of the
hand;) and the _Pha-lan'ges_, (fingers and thumb.)

97. The CLAVICLE is attached, at one extremity, to the sternum; at the
other, it is united to the scapula. It is shaped like the Italic
_[s]_. Its use is to keep the arms from sliding toward the breast.

98. The SCAPULA is situated upon the upper and back part of the chest.
It is flat, thin, and of a triangular form. This bone lies upon and is
retained in its position by muscles. By their contractions it may be
moved in different directions.

99. The HUMERUS is cylindrical, and is joined at the elbow with the
ulna of the fore-arm; at the scapular extremity, it is lodged in the
_glenoid_ cavity, where it is surrounded by a membranous bag, called
the _capsular ligament_.

perfect hinge-joint. This bone is situated on the inner side of the
fore-arm.

101. The RADIUS articulates with the bones of the carpus and forms the
wrist-joint. This bone is situated on the outside of the fore-arm,
(the side on which the thumb is placed.) The ulna and radius, at their
extremities, articulate with each other, by which union the hand is
made to rotate, permitting its complicated and varied movements.

102. The CARPUS is composed of eight bones, ranged in two rows, and so
firmly bound together, as to permit only a small amount of movement.

[Illustration: Fig. 15. U, The ulna. R, The radius. S, The scaphoid bone.

103. The METACARPUS is composed of five bones, upon four of which the
first range of the finger-bones is placed; and upon the other, the
first bone of the thumb. The five metacarpal bones articulate with the
second range of carpal bones.

the thumb has but two.

_Observation._ The wonderful adaptation of the hand to all the
mechanical offices of life, is one cause of man's superiority over the
rest of creation. This arises from the size and strength of the
thumbs, and the different lengths of the fingers.

105. The LOWER EXTREMITIES contain sixty bones--the _Fe'mur_,
(thigh-bone;) the _Pa-tel'la_, (knee-pan;) the _Tib'i-a_, (shin-bone;)
the _Fib'u-la_, (small bone of the leg;) the _Tar'sus_, (instep;) the
_Met-a-tar'sus_, (middle of the foot;) and the _Pha-lan'ges_, (toes.)

106. The FEMUR is the longest bone in the system. It supports the
weight of the head, trunk, and upper extremities. The large, round
head of this bone is placed in the acetabulum. This articulation is a
perfect specimen of the ball and socket joint.

107. The PATELLA is a small bone connected with the tibia by a strong
ligament. The tendon of the _ex-tens'or_ muscles of the leg is
attached to its upper edge. This bone is placed on the anterior part
of the lower extremity of the femur, and acts like a pulley, in the
extension of the limb.

108. The TIBIA is the largest bone of the leg. It is of a triangular
shape, and enlarged at each extremity.

109. The FIBULA is a smaller bone than the tibia, but of similar
shape. It is firmly bound to the tibia, at each extremity.

110. The TARSUS is formed of seven irregular bones, which are so
firmly bound together as to permit but little movement.

_Observation._ The tarsal and metatarsal bones are united so as to
give the foot an arched form, convex above, and concave below. This
structure conduces to the elasticity of the step, and the weight of
the body is transmitted to the ground by the spring of the arch, in a
manner which prevents injury to the numerous organs.

112. The PHALANGES (fig. 19) are composed of fourteen bones; each of
the small toes has three ranges of bones, while the great toe has but
two.

113. The JOINTS form an interesting part of the body. In their
construction, every thing shows the regard that has been paid to the
security and the facility of motion of the parts thus connected
together. They are composed of the extremities of two or more
bones, _Car'ti-lages_, (gristles,) _Syn-o'vi-al_ membrane, and
_Lig'a-ments_.

[Illustration: Fig. 21 The relative position of the bones, cartilages,

114. CARTILAGE is a smooth, solid, elastic substance, of a pearly
whiteness, softer than bone. It forms upon the articular surfaces of
the bones a thin incrustation, not more than the sixteenth of an inch
in thickness. Upon convex surfaces it is the thickest in the centre,
and thin toward the circumference; while upon concave surfaces, an
opposite arrangement is presented.

composed? What is illustrated by fig. 21? By fig. 22? 114. Define
cartilage.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

115. The SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE is a thin, membranous layer, which covers
the cartilages, and is thence bent back, or reflected upon the inner
surfaces of the ligaments which surround and enter into the
composition of the joints. This membrane forms a closed sac, like the
membrane that lines an egg-shell.

tendon of the muscle that extends the leg. 2, The patella. 3, The

(1) to the scapula (4.) The ligaments 5, 6, extend from the scapula to
the first bone of the arm.]

116. Beside the synovial membrane, there are numerous smaller sacs,
called _bur'sae mu-co'sae_. These are often associated with the
articulation. In structure, they are analogous to synovial membranes,
and secrete a similar fluid.

117. The LIGAMENTS are composed of numerous straight fibres, collected
together, and arranged into short bands of various breadths, or so
interwoven as to form a broad layer, which completely surrounds the
articular extremities of the bones, and constitutes a capsular
ligament. These connecting bands are white, glistening, and inelastic.
Most of the ligaments are found exterior to the synovial membrane.

118. The bones, cartilages, ligaments, and synovial membrane are
insensible when in health; yet they are supplied with organic nerves,
as well as with arteries, veins, and lymphatics.

_Observation._ The joints of the domestic animals are similar in their
construction to those of man. To illustrate this part of the body, a
fresh joint of the calf or sheep may be used. After divesting the
joints of the skin, the satin-like bands, or ligaments, will be seen
passing from one bone to the other, under which may be observed the
membranous bag, called the capsular ligament. This is very smooth, as
it is lined with the soft synovial membrane, beneath which will be
seen the cartilage, that may be cut with a knife, and under this the
rough extremity of the ends of the bones.

CHAPTER VI.

PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BONES.


119. The bones are the framework of the system. By their solidity and
form, they not only retain every part of the fabric in its proper
shape, but afford a firm surface for the attachment of the muscles and
ligaments. By means of the bones, the human frame presents to the eye
a wonderful piece of mechanism, uniting the most finished symmetry of
form with freedom of motion, and also giving security to many
important organs.

120. To give a clear idea of the relative uses of the bones and
muscles, we will quote the comparison of another, though, as in other
comparisons, there are points of difference. The "bones are to the
body what the masts and spars are to the ship,--they give support and
the power of resistance. The muscles are to the bones what the ropes
are to the masts and spars. The bones are the levers of the system; by
the action of the muscles their relative positions are changed. As the
masts and spars of a vessel must be sufficiently firm to sustain the
action of the ropes, so the bones must possess the same quality to
sustain the action of the muscles in the human body."

121. Some of the bones are designed exclusively for the protection of
the organs which they enclose. Of this number are those that form the
skull, the sockets of the eye, and the cavity of the nose. Others, in
addition to the protection they give to important organs, are useful
in movements of certain kinds. Of this class are the bones of the
spinal column, and ribs. Others are subservient to motion. Of this
class are the upper and lower extremities.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

119-128. _Give the physiology of the bones._ 119. How may the bones be
considered? 120. To what may the bones be compared? 121. Give the
different offices of the bones.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

122. The bones are subject to growth and decay; to removal of old,
useless matter, and the deposit of new particles, as in other tissues.
This has been tested by the following experiment. Some of the inferior
animals were fed with food that contained madder. In a few days, some
of the animals were killed, and their bones exhibited an unusually
reddish appearance. The remainder of the animals were, for a few
weeks, fed on food that contained no coloring principle. When they
were killed, their bones exhibited the usual color of such animals.
The coloring matter, which had been deposited, had been removed by the
action of the lymphatics.

123. The extremities of the bones that concur in forming a joint,
correspond by having their respective configurations reciprocal. They
are, in general, the one convex, and the other concave. In texture
they are porous, and consequently more elastic than if more compact.
These are covered with a cushion of cartilage. The elastic character
of these parts acts as so many springs, in diminishing the jar which
important organs of the system would otherwise receive.

124. The synovial membrane secretes a viscous fluid, which is called
_syn-o'vi-a_. This lubricating fluid of the joints enables the
surfaces of the bones and tendons to move smoothly upon each other,
thus diminishing the friction consequent on their action.

_Observations._ 1st. In this secretion is manifested the skill and
omnipotence of the Great Architect; for no machine of human invention
supplies to itself, by its own operations, the necessary lubricating
fluid. But, in the animal frame, it is supplied in proper quantities,
and applied in the proper place, and at the proper time.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

122. What is said of the change in bones? How was it proved that there
was a constant change in the osseous fabric? 123. What is said of the
extremities of the bones that form a joint? 124. What is synovia? Its
use? What is said of this lubricating fluid?

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

2d. In some cases of injury and disease, the synovial fluid is
secreted in large quantities, and distends the sac of the joint. This
affection is called dropsy of the joint, and occurs most frequently in
that of the knee.

125. The function of the ligaments is to connect and bind together the
bones of the system. By them the small bones of the wrist and foot, as
well as the large bones, are as securely fastened as if retained by
clasps of steel. Some of them are situated within the joints, like a
central cord, or pivot, (3, fig. 26.) Some surround it like a hood,
and contain the lubricating synovial fluid, (8, 9, fig. 25,) and some
in the form of bands at the side, (5, 6, fig. 23.)

[Illustration: Fig. 25. 8, 9, The ligaments that extend from the hip-bone
(6) to the femur, (5.)]

[Illustration: Fig. 26. 2, The socket of the hip-joint. 5, The head of
the femur, which is lodged in the socket. 3, The ligament within the
socket.]

126. By the ligaments the lower jaw is bound to the temporal bones,
and the head to the neck. They extend the whole length of the spinal
column, in powerful bands, on the outer surface, between the spinal
bones, and from one spinous process to another. They bind the ribs to
the vertebrae, to the transverse process behind, and to the sternum in
front; and this to the clavicle; and this to the first rib and
scapula; and this last to the humerus.

quantities? 125. What is the function of the ligaments? 126. Mention
how the bones of the system are connected.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

127. They also bind the two bones of the fore-arm at the elbow-joint;
and these to the wrist; and these to each other and to those of the
hand; and these last to each other and to those of the fingers and
thumb. In the same manner, they bind the bones of the pelvis together;
and these to the femur; and this to the two bones of the leg and
patella; and so on, to the ankle, foot, and toes, as in the upper
extremities.

[Illustration: Fig. 27. 1, A front view of the lateral ligaments of the
finger-joints. 2, A view of the anterior ligaments (_a_, _b_,) of the
finger-joints. 3, A side view of the lateral ligaments of the finger
joints.]

128. The different joints vary in range of movement, and in complexity
of structure. Some permit motions in all directions, as the shoulder;
some move in two directions, permitting only flexion and extension of
the part, as the elbow; while others have no movement, as the bones of
the head in the adult.

physiology of the bones from fig. 28, or from anatomical outline
plates No. 1 and 2.




CHAPTER VII

HYGIENE OF THE BONES.


129. _The bones increase in size and strength by use, while they are
weakened by inaction._ Exercise favors the deposition of both animal
and earthy matter, by increasing the circulation and nutrition in this
texture. For this reason, the bones of the laborer are dense and
strong, while those who neglect exercise, or are unaccustomed to
manual employment, are deficient in size, and have not a due
proportion of earthy matter to give them the solidity and strength of
the laboring man.

_Observation._ The tendons of the muscles are attached near the
extremities of the bones. Exercise of the muscles increases the action
of the vessels of that part to which the tendons are attached, and
thus increases the nutrition and size of this portion of the bone.
Hence the joints of an industrious mechanic or farmer are larger than
those of an individual who has not pursued manual vocations.

130. _The gelatinous bones of the child are not so well adapted for
labor and severe exercise as those of an adult._ 1st. They are liable
to become distorted. 2d. They are consolidated by the deposition of
earthy material before they are fully and properly developed. If a
young animal, as the colt, be put to severe, continued labor, the
deposition of earthy matter is hastened, and the bones are
consolidated before they attain full growth. Such colts make small and
inferior animals. Similar results follow, if a youth is compelled to
toil unduly before maturity of growth is attained. On the other hand,
moderate and regular labor favors a healthy development and
consolidation of the bones.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

129-148. _Give the hygiene of the bones._ 129. What effect has
exercise upon the bones? What effect has inaction? Why are the joints
of the industrious farmer and mechanic larger than those of a person
unaccustomed to manual employment? 130. Give the first reason why the
bones of the child are not adapted to severe exercise. The second
reason.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

131. _The kind and amount of labor should be adapted to the age,
health, and development of the bones._ Neither the flexible bones of
the child nor the brittle bones of the aged man are adapted, by their
organization, to long-continued, and hard labor. Those of the one bend
too easily, while those of the other fracture too readily. In middle
age, the proportions of animal and earthy matter are, usually, such as
to give the proper degree of flexibility, firmness, and strength for
labor, with little liability to injury.

132. _The imperfectly developed bones of the young child will not bear
long-continued exertions or positions without injury._ Hence the
requisitions of the rigid disciplinarian of schools, are unwise when
he compels his pupils to remain in one position for a long time. He
may have a "quiet school;" but, not unfrequently, by such discipline,
the constitution is impaired, and permanent injury is done to the
pupils.

133. _The lower extremities, in early life, contain but a small
proportion of earthy matter_; they bend when the weight of the body is
thrown upon them for a long time. Hence, the assiduous attempts to
induce children to stand or walk, either naturally or artificially,
when very young, are ill advised, and often productive of serious and
permanent evil. The "bandy" or bow legs are thus produced.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

What effect has moderate, regular labor upon the growing youth? 131.
What remark respecting the kind and amount of labor? At what age are
the bones best fitted for labor? 132. What effect has long-continued
exertions or positions on the bones of a child? What is said of the
requisitions of some teachers, who have the famed "quiet schools"?
133. Why should not the child be induced to stand or walk, either
naturally or artificially, at too early an age?

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

134. _The benches or chairs for children in a school-room should be of
such a height as to permit the feet to rest on the floor._ If the
bench is so high as not to permit the feet to rest upon the floor, the
weight of the limbs below the knee may cause the flexible bone of the
thigh to become curved. The child thus seated, is inclined to lean
forward, contracting an injurious and ungraceful habit. Again, when
the feet are not supported, the child soon becomes exhausted,
restless, and unfit for study. In the construction of a school-room,
the benches should be of different heights, so as to be adapted to the
different pupils, and they should also have appropriate backs.

[Illustration: Fig. 29. The position assumed when the seat is of proper
height, and the feet supported.]

[Illustration: Fig. 30. The position a child naturally assumes when the
seat is so high that the feet are not supported.]

134. What is said of the benches or chairs in a school-room? What is
represented by fig. 29? By fig. 30? What is the effect when the lower
limbs are not supported?

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

135. _Compression of the chest should be avoided._ In children, and
also in adults, the ribs are very flexible, and a small amount of
pressure will increase their curvature, particularly at the lower part
of the chest, and thus lessen the size of this cavity. The lower ribs
are united to the breast-bone, by long, yielding cartilages, and
compression may not only contract the chest, but an unseemly and
painful ridge may be produced, by the bending of the cartilages, on
one or both sides of the sternum.

[Illustration: Fig. 31. A natural and well-proportioned chest.]

[Illustration: Fig. 32. A chest fashionably deformed.]

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

135. Why should compression of the chest be avoided? What is
represented by fig. 31? By fig. 32?

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

136. Again, the cartilages on one side may be bent outward, while
those on the opposite side are bent inward, thus forming a depression
parallel with the sternum. In some instances, the anterior extremity
of the lower ribs on each side are brought nearly or quite together.
In these instances, the movable extremities of the ribs are drawn down
toward the haunch-bones, while the space between the ribs is lessened.
All this may be effected by tight or "snug" clothing. Therefore the
apparel of a child should be loose, and supported over the shoulders,
to avoid the before-mentioned evils. The same may be said of the
clothing for adults.

137. _The erect position in sitting and standing should be assiduously
observed._ The spinal column, in its natural position, curves from
front to back, but not from side to side The admirable arrangement of
the bones, alternating with cartilages, permits a great variety of
motions and positions; and when the spine is inclined to either side,
the elasticity of its cartilages tends to restore it to its natural
position. For this reason we may incline the spinal column in any
direction for a short time, without danger of permanent curvature, if,
afterward, the erect position is assumed.[4]

   [4] Compare 1, 1, Fig. 28, with 2, 2, 2, Fig. 48.

138. But if a stooping position, or a lateral curved posture, is
continued for a long time, the spinal column does not easily recover
its proper position, for the compressed edges of the cartilages lose
their power of reaction, and finally one side of the cartilage becomes
thinned, while the other is thickened; and these wedge-shaped
cartilages produce a permanent curvature of the spinal column. In a
similar way, the student, seamstress, artisan, and mechanic acquire a
stooping position, and become round shouldered, by inclining forward
to bring their books or work nearer the eyes.

136. May simply "snug" clothing compress the cartilages? How should
the apparel of a child be worn? 137. In what direction does the spinal
column, in its natural position, curve? What restores it to its
natural position when curved laterally? 138. What is the effect if a
lateral curved position of the spinal column is continued for a long
time? 139. When one shoulder is elevated for a long time, what is the
effect upon the spinal column?

139. Pupils, while writing, drawing, and sometimes while studying,
frequently incline the spinal column to one side, in order to
accommodate themselves to the desks at which they are seated. Often,
these are higher than the elbow as it hangs from the shoulder while at
rest. This attitude elevates one shoulder while it depresses the
other; consequently, the upper part of the spinal column is inclined
toward the elevated shoulder, and the lower part is curved in the
opposite direction, giving the form of the letter _S_ to the
supporting column of the body.

[Illustration: Fig. 33. The table is of proper height, the position is
correct, and the spinal column, 1, 1, is straight, while the shoulders
are of equal height.]

_Experiment._ Let a pupil be placed at a desk or table with one elbow
raised, as is frequently seen while writing, or at study, and observe
the condition of the shoulder and spinal column in this position.
Place another pupil at a table no higher than the elbow when it hangs
by the side while sitting, and observe the appearance of the shoulders
and spinal column. By a comparison of the two attitudes, the preceding
remarks will be comprehended and appreciated.

[Illustration: Fig. 34. The table is too high, and the position is
oblique and improper. The right shoulder is seen higher than the left,
while the spinal column, 1, 1, exhibits three curves.]

140. One shoulder may be elevated, and no injurious results follow,
provided care is taken not to keep it in the raised position too long,
or if the opposite shoulder is elevated for the same period of time.
The right shoulder projects more frequently than the left. This arises
from the greater use of the right hand with the shoulder elevated, and
not unfrequently the oblique positions assumed in performing the daily
vocations of life. With proper care, and by calling into action the
left shoulder, this deformity can be prevented.
