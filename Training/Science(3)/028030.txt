RELUCTANT GENIUS

By O. H. LESLIE


    _It is said that Life crawled up from the slime of the sea-bottoms
    and became Man because of inherent greatness bred into him before
    the dawn of time. But perhaps this urge was not as formless as we
    think._


Buos was chastising Laloi as they sped through the ionosphere of the
green planet. But like the airy creature she was, Laloi ignored the
criticism and rippled zephyr-like through a clump of daffodils when they
completed their descent.
