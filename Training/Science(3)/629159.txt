Steel-Blues was rising silently from the asteroid.

Up and up it rose, then flames flickered in a circle about its curious
shape. The ship disappeared, suddenly accelerating.

Jon Karyl strained his eyes.

Finally he looked away from the heavens to the two Steel-Blues who stood
negligently outside the goldfish bowl.

Once more, Jon used the stubray pistol. He marched out of the plastic
igloo and ran toward the service station.

He didn't know how weak he was until he stumbled and fell only a few
feet from his prison.

The Steel-Blues just watched him.

He crawled on, around the circular pit in the sward of the asteroid
where one Steel-Blue had shown him the power of his weapon.

He'd been crawling through a nightmare for years when the quiet voice
penetrated his dulled mind.

"Take it easy, Karyl. You're among friends."

He pried open his eyes with his will. He saw the blue and gold of a
space guard's uniform. He sighed and drifted into unconsciousness.

       *       *       *       *       *

He was still weak days later when Capt. Ron Small of SP-101 said,

"Yes, Karyl, it's ironical. They fed you what they thought was sure
death, and it's the only thing that kept you going long enough to warn
us."

"I was dumb for a long time," Karyl said. "I thought that it was the
acid, almost to the very last. But when I drank that last glass, I knew
they didn't have a chance.

"They were metal monsters. No wonder they feared that liquid. It would
rust their joints, short their wiring, and kill them. No wonder they
stared when I kept alive after drinking enough to completely annihilate
a half-dozen of them.

"But what happened when you met the ship?"

The space captain grinned.

"Not much. Our crew was busy creating a hollow shell filled with _water_
to be shot out of a rocket tube converted into a projectile thrower.

"These Steel-Blues, as you call them, put traction beams on us and
started tugging us toward the asteroid. We tried a couple of atomic
shots but when they just glanced off, we gave up.

"They weren't expecting the shell of water. When it hit that blue ship,
you could almost see it oxidize before your eyes.

"I guess they knew what was wrong right away. They let go the traction
beams and tried to get away. They forgot about the force field, so we
just poured atomic fire into the weakening ship. It just melted away."

Jon Karyl got up from the divan where he'd been lying. "They thought I
was a metal creature, too. But where do you suppose they came from?"

The captain shrugged. "Who knows?"

Jon set two glasses on the table.

"Have a drink of the best damn water in the solar system?" He asked
Capt. Small.

"Don't mind if I do."

The water twinkled in the two glasses, winking as if it knew just what
it had done.
