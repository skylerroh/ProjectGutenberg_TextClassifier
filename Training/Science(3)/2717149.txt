Kekule tells how he discovered the constitution of benzene in the
_Berichte der Deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft_, V. XXIII, I, p. 1306.
I have quoted it with some other instances of dream discoveries in _The
Independent_ of Jan. 26, 1918. Even this innocent scientific vision has
not escaped the foul touch of the Freudians. Dr. Alfred Robitsek in
"Symbolisches Denken in der chemischen Forschung," _Imago_, V. I, p. 83,
has deduced from it that Kekule was morally guilty of the crime of
OEdipus as well as minor misdemeanors.

The pamphlet containing a synopsis of the lectures by the late Alois von
Isakovics on "Synthetic Perfumes and Flavors," published by the Synfleur
Scientific Laboratories, Monticello, New York, is immensely interesting.
Van Dyk & Co., New York, issue a pamphlet on the composition of oil of
