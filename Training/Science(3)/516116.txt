    leaves are covered with insect galls.

Value for planting: It is extensively planted as a shade tree in the
    Middle West, and is frequently seen as an ornamental tree in the
    East.

Commercial value: It has little economic value except for fuel.

Other characters: The _fruit_ is berry-like, with a hard pit. The fleshy
    outer part is sweet.

Other common names: _Nettle tree_; _sugarberry_.



GROUP VIII. THE OAKS AND CHESTNUT

How to tell them from other trees: The oaks are rather difficult to
    identify and, in studying them it will often be necessary to look
    for more than one distinguishing character. The oaks differ from
    other trees in bearing _acorns_. Their _leaves_ have many lobes and
    their upper lateral _buds_ cluster at the top of the twigs. The
    general contour of each oak presents a characteristic branching and
    sturdiness uncommon in other trees.

    The chestnut differs from other trees in bearing _burs_ and its
    _bark_ is also distinctly characteristic.

How to tell them from each other: There are two groups of oaks, the
    _white oak_ and the _black oak_. The white oaks mature their acorns
    in one year and, therefore, only acorns of the same year can be
    found on trees of this group. The black oaks take two years in which
    to mature their acorns and, therefore, young acorns of the present
    year and mature acorns of the previous year may be found on the same
    tree at one time. The _leaves_ of the white oaks have rounded
    margins and rounded lobes as in Fig. 57, while those of the black
    oaks have pointed margins and sharp pointed lobes as shown in Figs.
    60, 62 and 64. The _bark_ of the white oaks is light colored and
    breaks up in loose flakes as in Fig. 58, while that of the black
    oaks is darker and deeply ridged or tight as in Figs. 59 and 61. The
    white oak is the type of the white oak group and the black, red and
    pin oaks are types of the other. For the characterization of the
    individual species, the reader is referred to the following pages.

[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Leaf and Fruit of White Oak. (Quercus alba.)]


WHITE OAK (_Quercus alba_)

Distinguishing characters: The massive ramification of its branches is
    characteristic of this species and often an easy clue to its
    identification. The *bark* has a *light gray color*--lighter than
    that of the other oaks--and breaks into soft, loose flakes as in
    Fig. 58. The *leaves are deeply lobed* as in Fig. 57. The *buds are
    small, round and congested* at the end of the year's growth. The
    acorns usually have no stalks and are set in shallow, rough cups.
    The kernels of the acorns are white and palatable.

Form and size: The white oak grows into a large tree with a
    wide-spreading, massive crown, dissolving into long, heavy, twisted
    branches. When grown in the open it possesses a short sturdy trunk;
    in the forest its trunk is tall and stout.

Range: Eastern North America.

[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Bark of White Oak. (Quercus alba.)]

Soil and location: The white oak thrives in almost any well-drained,
    good, deep soil except in a very cold and wet soil. It requires
    plenty of light and attains great age.

Enemies: The tree is comparatively free from insects and disease except
    in districts where the Gipsy moth is common, in which case the
    leaves of the white oak are a favorite food of its caterpillars.

[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Bark of Black Oak. (Quercus velutina).]

Value for planting: The white oak is one of the most stately trees. Its
    massive form and its longevity make the tree suitable for both lawn
    and woodland planting but it is not used much because it is
    difficult to transplant and grows rather slowly.

Commercial value: The wood is of great economic importance. It is heavy,
    hard, strong and durable and is used in cooperage, construction
    work, interior finish of buildings and for railroad ties, furniture,
    agricultural implements and fuel.

Comparisons: The _swamp white oak_ (_Quercus platanoides_) is similar to
    the white oak in general appearance of the bark and form and is
    therefore liable to be confused with it. It differs from the white
    oak, however, in possessing a more straggly habit and in the fact
    that the bark on the under side of its branches shags in loose,
    large scales. Its buds are smaller, lighter colored and more downy
    and its acorns are more pointed and with cups more shallow than
    those of the white oak. The tree also grows in moister ground,
    generally bordering swamps.

[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Leaf and Fruit of Black Oak. (Quercus
velutina).]


BLACK OAK (_Quercus velutina_)

Distinguishing characters: The *bark* is black, rough and cut up into
    firm *ridges* especially at the base of the tree, see Fig. 59. The
    _inner bark_ has a _bright yellow color_: the *leaves* have _sharp
    points_ and are wider at the base than at the tip as shown in Fig.
    60. The buds are _large, downy_ and _sharp pointed_. The acorns are
    small and have deep, scaly cups the inner margins of which are
    downy. The kernels are yellow and bitter.

Form and size: The tree grows in an irregular form to large size, with
    its branches rather slender as compared with the white oak and with
    a more open and narrow crown.

Range: Eastern North America.

Soil and location: It will grow in poor soils but does best where the
    soil is rich and well drained.

Enemies: None of importance.

Value for planting: The black oak is the poorest of the oaks for
    planting and is rarely offered by nurserymen.

Commercial value: The wood is heavy, hard and strong, but checks readily
    and is coarse grained. It is of little value except for fuel. The
    bark is used for tannin.

Other common names: _Yellow oak_.

Comparisons: The black oak might sometimes be confused with the _red_
    and _scarlet oaks_. The yellow, bitter inner bark will distinguish
    the black oak from the other two. The light-colored, smooth bark of
    the red oak and the dark, ridged bark of the black oak will
    distinguish the two, while the bark of the scarlet oak has an
    appearance intermediate between the two. The buds of the three
    species also show marked differences. The buds of the black oak are
    covered with hairs, those of the scarlet oak have fewer hairs and
    those of the red are practically free from hairs. The leaves of each
    of the three species are distinct and the growth habits are
    different.


RED OAK (_Quercus rubra_)

Distinguishing characters: The *bark* is perpendicularly fissured into
    long, _smooth, light gray strips_ giving the trunk a characteristic
    *pillar effect* as in Figs. 61 and 94. It has the straightest trunk
    of all the oaks. The leaves possess _more lobes_ than the leaves of
    any of the other species of the black oak group, see Fig. 62. The
    acorns, the largest among the oaks, are semispherical with the cups
    extremely shallow. The buds are large and sharp pointed, but not as
    large as those of the black oak. They also have a few fine hairs on
    their scales, but are not nearly as downy as those of the Black oak.

[Illustration: FIG. 61--Bark of Red Oak.]

Form and size: The red oak is the largest of the oaks and among the
    largest of the trees in the northern forests. It has a straight
    trunk, free from branches to a higher point than in the white oak,
    see Fig. 94. The branches are less twisted and emerge at sharper
    angles than do those of the white oak.

Range: It grows all over Eastern North America and reaches north farther
    than any of the other oaks.

Soil and location: It is less fastidious in its soil and moisture
    requirements than the other oaks and therefore grows in a great
    variety of soils. It requires plenty of light.

[Illustration: FIG. 62.--Leaf and Fruit of Red Oak.]

Enemies: Like most of the other oaks, this species is comparatively free
    from insects and disease.

Value for planting: The red oak grows faster and adapts itself better to
    poor soil conditions than any of the other oaks and is therefore
    easy to plant and easy to find in the nurseries. It makes an
    excellent street tree, is equally desirable for the lawn and is
    hardly surpassed for woodland planting.

Commercial value: The wood is hard and strong but coarse grained, and is
    used for construction timber, interior finish and furniture. It is
    inferior to white oak where strength and durability are required.


PIN OAK (_Quercus palustris_)

Distinguishing characters: Its method of *branching* will characterize
    the tree at a glance. It develops a well-defined _main_ ascending
    _stem_ with numerous _drooping_ side _branches_ as in Fig. 63. The
    buds are very small and sharp pointed and the leaves are small as in
    Fig. 64. The bark is dark, firm, smooth and in close ridges. The
    acorn is small and carries a light brown, striped nut, wider than
    long and bitter. The cup is shallow, enclosing only the base of the
    nut.

[Illustration: FIG. 63.--Pin Oaks in Winter.]

Form and size: The pin oak is a medium-sized tree in comparison with
    other oaks. It develops a tall, straight trunk that tapers
    continuously through a pyramidal crown of low, drooping tender,
    branches.

Range: Eastern North America.

Soil and location: It requires a deep, rich, moist soil and grows
    naturally near swamps. Its roots are deep and spreading. The tree
    grows rapidly and is easily transplanted.

Enemies: None of importance.

Value for planting: The pin oak is an extremely graceful tree and is
    therefore extensively used for planting on lawns and on certain
    streets where the tree can find plenty of water and where conditions
    will permit its branches to droop low.

Commercial value: The wood is heavy and hard but coarse grained and
    liable to check and warp. Its principal use is in the construction
    of houses and for shingles.

[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Leaf and Fruit of Pin Oak.]


CHESTNUT (_Castanea dentata_)

Distinguishing characters: The *bark* in young trees is smooth and of a
    marked reddish-bronze color, but when the tree grows older, the bark
    breaks up into *diamond-shaped ridges*, sufficiently characteristic
    to distinguish the tree at a glance, see Fig. 65. A close
    examination of the _terminal twig_ will show _three ridges_ and _two
    grooves_ running down along the stem from the base of each leaf or
    leaf-scar. The twig has no true terminal bud. The fruit, a large,
    round *bur*, prickly without and hairy within and enclosing the
    familiar dark brown, sweet edible nuts is also a distinguishing mark
    of the tree.

Leaf: The leaves are distinctly long and narrow. They are from 6 to 8
    inches long.

Form and size: The chestnut is a large tree with a massive trunk and
    broad spreading crown. The chestnut tree when cut, sprouts readily
    from the stump and therefore in places where the trees have once
    been cut, a group of two to six trees may be seen emerging from the
    old stump.

[Illustration: FIG. 65.--Trunk of Chestnut Tree.]

Range: Eastern United States.

Soil and location: It will grow on rocky as well as on fertile soils and
    requires plenty of light.

Enemies: During the past nine years nearly all the chestnut trees in the
    United States have been attacked by a fungus disease (_Diaporthe
    parasitica_, Mur.) which still threatens the entire extinction of
    the chestnut trees in this country. No remedy has been discovered
    and all affected trees should be cut down and the wood utilized
    before it decays and becomes worthless. No species of chestnut tree
    is entirely immune from this disease, though some species are highly
    resistant.

Value for planting: The chestnut is one of the most rapidly growing
    hardwood trees but, on account of its disease, which is now
    prevalent everywhere, it is not wise to plant chestnut trees for the
    present.

Commercial value: The wood is light, not very strong and liable to warp.
    It is durable when brought in contact with the soil and is therefore
    used for railroad ties, fence-posts, poles, and mine timbers. It is
    also valuable for interior finish in houses and for fuel. Its bark
    is used in the manufacture of tanning extracts and the nuts are sold
    in cities in large quantities.

HOW TO IDENTIFY TREES--(Continued)



GROUP IX. THE HICKORIES, WALNUT AND BUTTERNUT

How to tell them from other trees and from each other: The hickory
    trees, though symmetrical, have a rugged _appearance_ and the
    _branches_ are so sturdy and black as to give a special distinction
    to this group. The _buds_ are different from the buds of all other
    trees and sufficiently characteristic to distinguish the various
    species of the group. The _bark_ is also a distinguishing character.

    The walnut and butternut have _chambered piths_ which distinguish
    them from all other trees and from each other.


SHAGBARK HICKORY (_Hicoria ovata_)

Distinguishing characters: The yellowish brown *buds* nearly as large as
    those of the mockernut hickory, _are each provided with two long,
    dark, outer scales_ which stand out very conspicuously as shown in
    Fig. 67. The *bark* in older specimens *shags* off in rough strips,
    sometimes more than a foot long, as shown in Fig. 68. These two
    characters will readily distinguish the tree at all seasons of the
    year.

[Illustration: FIG. 66.--A Shagbark Hickory Tree.]

Leaf: The leaf is compound, consisting of 5 or 7 leaflets, the terminal
    one generally larger.

Form and size: A tall, stately tree--the tallest of the hickories--of
    rugged form and fine symmetry, see Fig. 66.

Range: Eastern North America.

Soil and location: The shagbark hickory grows in a great variety of
    soils, but prefers a deep and rather moist soil.

Enemies: The _hickory bark borer_ (_Scolytus quadrispinosus_) is its
    principal enemy. The insect is now killing thousands of hickory
    trees in the vicinity of New York City and on several occasions has
