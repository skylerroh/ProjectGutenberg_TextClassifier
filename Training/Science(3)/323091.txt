to Kutrov, "You would find them quite understandable."

I wandered over to the window, in search of air, and noted that someone
had indiscreetly left a comfortable chair vacant. I was near the door,
so that I could hear Jocelyn say to Fayliss: "It was--very moving. Why,
I could almost feel that you were singing about us."

Fayliss smiled again. "That is as it should be."

"Of course," chimed in Loring, who'd come up to ask Fayliss if he could
have a copy of the score, "that's the test of expert performance."

The lights were dimmed again by the fog of tobacco smoke, and I could
see the street quite clearly by moonlight. I decided I would watch
Fayliss, and see if his eyes did glow in the dark. I saw him go down the
sidewalk, with that graceful stride of his, his hands in his pockets.
But I couldn't see his eyes at all.

Then a gust of wind tugged his hat, and, for an instant I thought he'd
have to go scrambling after it. But, quick as a rapier thrust, a tail
darted out from beneath his dress coat, caught the hat, and set it back
upon his head.
