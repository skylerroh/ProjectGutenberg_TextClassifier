Ezekiel must have been something of a numerologist. He points out that
there are four creatures, and each of the four has four faces each,
and each has four wings each--but not four hands.


_9. Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they
went; they went every one straight forward._

He is not saying that the wings of one creature are joined to the
wings of another creature. He is saying that each wing is joined to
another wing, not directly to the creature.

The second and third parts of this verse present a mystery. We do not
know what the "theys" refer to. There are three "theys" in this verse,
one after another and we are given very few clues to which refer to
_creatures_ and which refer to wings. The first "they" most likely is
tied to the first part of the verse and therefore refers to the wings.
Given this, there are still three interpretations:

     1. _The wings_ turned not when _the wings_ went; _The wings_
     went every one straight forward.

     2. _The wings_ turned not when _the creatures_ went; _The
     wings_ went every one straight forward.

     3. _The wings_ turned not when _the creatures_ went; _The
     creatures_ went every one straight forward.

None of these three statements make much of a point, whether the
creatures have helicopter wings, or bird-angel wings. Let us assume
then that the first "they" refers to the creatures:

     1. _The creatures_ turned not when _the creatures_ went;
     _The creatures_ went every one straight forward.

     2. _The creatures_ turned not when _the wings_ went; _The
     wings_ went every one straight forward.

     3. _The creatures_ turned not when _the wings_ went; _The
     creatures_ went every one straight forward.

This last statement would pretty well describe the action of the
blades of an inoperative helicopter being carried forward in a
straight line. It would strike Ezekiel as odd that the wings might
move and turn without turning the men under them. You might wonder why
he would say "... wings went ..." instead of "... wings turned...."
When a light breeze moves the blades of an inoperative helicopter the
blades not only turn, but they change their pitch and plane in a most
random manner.

Although Ezekiel has not completed his description of the creatures,
we can try now to form a picture of what he saw. No matter how we bend
and squeeze, we are not going to get a Michelangelo-type angel. Look
at figure one. Go back over the points that Ezekiel has described. You
will see that it fits quite well.


_10. As for the likeness of the faces, they four had the face of a
man, and the face of a lion, on the right side; and they four had the
face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an
eagle._

This again does not sound very man-like. You wonder what could have
kept him from pronouncing them demons. If you will study figure two,
you will see what Ezekiel described. Now look at figure three. How
much better could a man living six centuries before Christ describe
figure three?


_11. Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; Two
wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their
bodies._

See figure one again. The arrangement is like he describes. Notice
that when he talks about "... the wings ..." of one creature, he
apparently means the whole system of wings and attachments.


_12. And they went every one straight forward: wither the spirit was
to go, they went; and they turned not as they went._

Again we have trouble with the "theys." Notice however, that the first part
of this verse repeats the last part of verse nine. If we were right in that
verse, the first "they" in this refers to the creatures again. The second
part of this verse contains a new idea, "whither the spirit was to go ...",
has an opposite meaning from "... they went ... straight forward ..."
and, "... they turned not when they went." The first and last part sounds
like the four creatures were marching purposefully in one direction. If
then the second or middle part refers to the wings, we could read it:

     "And _the creatures_ went every one straight forward:
     whither the spirit was to go, _the wings_ went; and _the
     creatures_ turned not when _the wings_ went."

Again we have a picture of four men walking with their inoperative
helicopters moving in several different ways as the breeze and the
men's motions cause them to move slightly.

Notice that Ezekiel seems to be more impressed with the wings and
their motion than with any other feature of what he witnessed.


_13. As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was
like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went
up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and
out of the fire went forth lightning._

[Illustration]

Here he is describing their over-all appearance. We can assume that
creatures that look like men but has a surface that resembles lights,
coals and fire must be wearing suits with a brightly colored metallic
surface. The modern anodized aluminium coatings glisten and sparkle
with an effect like he describes. If these are space-suits, there is a
good reason for making them gaudy. If they were worn in space while
working on and around a ship, they should be as bright and
eye-catching as possible, in the case the man became detached and
floated away. He would be quite visible against the blackness of
space.
