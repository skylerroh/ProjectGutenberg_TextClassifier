
"I'm sure they didn't mean to be unkind," Slood assured him. "Naturally,
you were a strange creature to them and they're only--"

"_Unkind?_" Narli gave a bitter laugh. "They practically killed me with
kindness! It was fuss, fuss, fuss all the time."

"Now, Narli, I do wish you wouldn't be quite so sarcastic."

"I'm _not_ being sarcastic. And I wasn't a strange creature to them. It
seems there's a sort of popular child's toy on Earth known as a--" he
winced--"teddy bear. I aroused pleasant childhood memories in them, so
they showered me with affection and edibles."

Slood closed his eyes in anguish. "You are very brave, Narli," he said
almost reverently. "Very brave and wise and good. Certainly that would
be the best thing to tell our people. After all, the Terrestrials are
our allies; we don't want to stir up public sentiment against them. But
you can be honest with _me_, Narli. Did they refuse to serve you in
restaurants? Were you segregated in public vehicles? Did they shrink
from you when you came close?"

Narli beat the desk with all four hands. "I was hardly ever given the
chance to be alone! They crawled all over me! Restaurants begged for my
trade! I had to hire private vehicles because in public ones I was
mobbed by admirers!"

"Such a short time," Slood murmured, "and already suspicious of even me,
your oldest friend. But don't talk about it if you don't want to,
Narli.... Tell me, though, did they sneer at you and whisper
half-audible insults? Did they--"

"You're right!" Narli snapped. "I _don't_ want to talk about it."

Slood placed a comforting hand upon his shoulder. "Perhaps that's
wisest, until the shock of your experience has worn off."

Narli made an irritable noise.

"The Perzils are giving a vilbar party tonight," Slood said. "But I know
how you feel about parties. I've told them you're exhausted from your
trip and won't be able to make it."

"Oh, you did, did you?" Narli asked ironically. "What makes you think
you know how I feel about parties?"

"But--"

"There's an interesting saying on Earth: 'Travel is so broadening.'" He
looked down at his bulges with tolerant amusement. "In more than one
way, in case the meaning eludes you. Very sound psychologically. I've
discovered that I _like_ parties. I _like_ being _liked_. If you'll
excuse me, I'm going to inform the Perzils that I shall be delighted to
come to their party. Care to join me?"

"Well," Slood mumbled, "I'd like to, but I have so much work--"

"Introvert!" said Narli, and he began dialing the Perzils.
