"Yes. It is an aspect you have not considered, Mr. Kinderwood." The
sociologist's face seemed haggard. "Even a few generations ago, Earth as
it is today would have seemed like a concept of heaven. We know now it
is not enough, but we don't know why. Perhaps, if we can reach the stars
the problem will cease to be critical. By the same token, life from the
stars may come here first.

"We have no remotest idea what such an eventuality would entail. It may
provide a solution. It may quite conceivably send man back to the
forests and jungles.

"You have experienced our only answer to the latter possibility. While
providing man with everything to which he has aspired for milleniums, we
instill in him, through the media of entertainment, knowledge of all the
survival practices known to the backtimers who painfully nurtured
civilization from an embryonic idea to its present pinnacle. We can do
no more."

Allen flexed his arms involuntarily at the sheer enormity of the idea.
It was one thing to let a useless race expire, quite another to think of
its being forced back to-- "But--can't anyone think of anything else to
do?"

"Whoever is capable of devising anything else," the old doctor said
resignedly, "will undoubtedly be able to carry it out with or without
our assistance." He pressed more buttons and there was a muted sound of
the voder calling a number. "The exit over there, Mr. Kinderwood.
And--much happiness."

Allen's thoughts swirled in tumultuous confusion. Dimly, he realized
that man had outstripped himself, and saw with intense bitterness that
there was no answer on Earth for any ordinary citizen. Or was there? And
if there was, was it worth trying to find? He flung open the door to the
corridor violently, as though the force could quiet his mind. Maybe, if
he didn't use the permit, he could stay and figure out an answer. Nedda
would be sympathetic and patient while-- And then he stopped. Across the
wide hallway, Nedda stood beneath a window, looking at him. And the
blond youth held her with flushed understanding, impatiently waiting,
caressing her arm with his hand, binding her to him with the one bond
she could not break.

She watched Allen start slowly down the corridor. Once, when he
stumbled, she gave a stifled sob, and tears brimmed and spilled silently
when he passed through the door marked _Kansas City Department of
Euthanasia_.
