the dead in the snows, her naked body gleaming like ivory and her golden
hair like a blinding flame in the moonlight. I lay and howled like a
dying dog because I could not crawl after her. She lures men from
stricken fields into the wastelands to be slain by her brothers, the
ice-giants, who lay men's red hearts smoking on Ymir's board. Amra has
seen Atali, the frost-giant's daughter!"

"Bah!" grunted Horsa. "Old Gorm's mind was turned in his youth by a
sword cut on the head. Amra was delirious with the fury of battle. Look
how his helmet is dinted. Any of those blows might have addled his
brain. It was an hallucination he followed into the wastes. He is from
the south; what does he know of Atali?"

"You speak truth, perhaps," muttered Amra. "It was all strange and
weird--by Crom!"

He broke off, glaring at the object that still dangled from his clenched
left fist; the others gaped silently at the veil he held up--a wisp of
gossamer that was never spun by human distaff.
