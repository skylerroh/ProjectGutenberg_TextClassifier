PROSPECTUS
OF THE
SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN
For 1877,
THE MOST POPULAR SCIENTIFIC PAPER IN
THE WORLD.
----
THIRTY-SECOND YEAR.
----
VOLUME XXXVI.--NEW SERIES.
----

The publishers of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN beg to announce that on the
sixth day of January, 1877, a new volume was commenced. It will
continue to be the aim of the publishers to render the contents of the
new volume more attractive and useful than any of its predecessors.

_To the Mechanic and Manufacturer._ No person engaged in any of the
mechanical pursuits should think of doing without the SCIENTIFIC
AMERICAN. Every number contains from six to ten engravings of new
machines and inventions which cannot be found in any other
publication.

TERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION. One copy of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN will be
sent for _one year_, 52 numbers, POSTAGE PREPAID, to any subscriber in
the United States or Canada, on receipt of _three dollars and twenty
cents_ by the publishers.

_One extra copy_ of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN will be supplied gratis
_for every club of five subscribers_ at $3.20 each; or six copies for
$16.50 without extra copy. Postage free.

THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.

A weekly paper, uniform in size with the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, but a
distinct publication. It contains working drawings of engineering
works, and elaborate treatises on every branch of Science and
Mechanics, by eminent writers, at home and abroad. An illustrated
cover protects the handsomely printed sheets. Price, $5.00 per annum.
Single copies 10 cents.

_One copy of the_ SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN _and one copy of the_ SCIENTIFIC
AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT will be sent for one year, postage prepaid, to any
subscriber in the United States or Canada, on receipt of _seven
Dollars_ by the publishers.

The safest way to remit is by Postal-Order, Draft, or Express. Money
carefully placed inside of envelopes, securely sealed, and carefully
addressed, seldom goes astray; but it is at the sender's risk. Address
all letters and make all orders, drafts, etc., payable to

 MUNN & CO., 37 PARK ROW, NEW YORK.

       *       *       *       *       *
