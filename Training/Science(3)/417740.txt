
DYESTUFFS AND COLOURS


_Classification._--In classifying the different dyestuffs and colouring
matters it is, of course, necessary to consider first the properties of
those colouring matters generally, and secondly the particular reason
for making such classification. The scientific chemist, for example,
would classify them according to theoretical considerations, as members
of certain typical groups; the representative of medical science or
hygiene would naturally classify them as poisonous and non-poisonous
bodies; whilst the dyer will as naturally seek to arrange them according
to their behaviour when applied to textile fabrics. But this behaviour
on applying to textile fibres, if varied in character according to the
chemical nature of the colouring matter, as well as the chemical and
physical nature of the fabric--and it is so varied--will make such
classification, if it is to be thorough-going, not a very simple matter.
I may tell you that it is not a simple matter, and, moreover, the best
classification and arrangement is that one which depends both on the
action of the dyes on the fibres, and also on the intrinsic chemical
character of the dyestuffs themselves. Since the higher branches of
organic chemistry are involved in the consideration of the structure and
dispositions, and consequently more or less of the properties of these
dyes, you will readily comprehend that the thorough appreciation and use
of that highest and best method of classification, particularly in the
case of the coal-tar dyes, will be, more or less, a sealed book except
to the student of organic chemistry. But it may be asked, "How does that
highest and best method of classifying the dyestuffs affect the users,
the dyers, in their processes?" In reply, I would say, "I believe that
the dyer who so understands the chemical principles involved in the
processes he carries out, and in the best methods of classifying the
dyes as chemical substances, so as to be able to act independently of
the prescriptions and recipes given him by the dye manufacturers, and so
be master of his own position, will, _ceteris paribus_, be the most
economical and successful dyer." Many manufacturers of dyestuffs have
said the very same thing to me, but, independently of this, I know it,
and can prove it with the greatest ease. Let me now, by means of an
experiment or two, prove to you that at least some classification is
necessary to begin with. So different and varied are the substances used
as colouring matters by the dyer, both as regards their chemical and
physical properties, that they even act differently towards the same
fibre. I will take four pieces of cotton fabric; three of them are
simple white cotton, whilst the fourth cotton piece has had certain
metallic salts mixed with thickening substances like gum, printed on it
in the form of a pattern, which at present cannot readily be discerned.
We will now observe and note the different action on these pieces of
cotton--(i.) of a Turmeric bath, (ii.) a Magenta bath, and (iii.) a
madder or Alizarin bath. The Turmeric dyes the cotton a fast yellow, the
Magenta only stains the cotton crimson, and on washing with water alone,
almost every trace of colour is removed again; the madder, however,
stains the cotton with no presentable shade of colour at all, produces a
brownish-yellow stain, removed at once by a wash in water. But let us
take the printed piece of cotton and dye that in the Alizarin bath, and
then we shall discover the conditions for producing colours with such a
dyestuff as madder or Alizarin. Different coloured stripes are
produced, and the colours are conditioned by the kind of metallic salts
used. Evidently the way in which, the turmeric dyes the cotton is
different from that in which the madder dyes it. The first is a yellow
dyestuff, but it would be hard to assign any one shade or tint to
Alizarin as a dyestuff. In fact Alizarin (the principle of madder) is of
itself not a dye, but it forms with each of several metals a differently
coloured compound; and thus the metallic salt in the fabric is actually
converted into a coloured compound, and the fabric is dyed or printed.
The case is just the same with logwood black dyeing: without the
presence of iron ("copperas," etc.), sulphate of copper ("bluestone"),
or bichrome, you would get no black at all. We will now try similar
experiments with woollen fabrics, taking three simple pieces of flannel,
and also two pieces, the one having been first treated with a hot
solution of alum and cream of tartar, and the other with copperas or
sulphate of iron solution, and then washed. Turmeric dyes the first
yellow, like it did the cotton. Magenta, however, permanently dyes the
woollen as it did not the cotton. Alizarin only stains the untreated
woollen, whilst the piece treated with alumina is dyed red, and that
with iron, purple. If, however, the pieces treated with iron and alumina
had been dyed in the Magenta solution, only one colour would have been
the result, and that a Magenta-red in each case. Here we have, as proved
by our experiments, two distinct classes of colouring matters. The one
class comprises those which are of themselves the actual colour. The
colour is fully developed in them, and to dye a fabric they only require
fixing in their unchanged state upon that fabric. Such dyes are termed
_monogenetic_, because they can only generate or yield different shades
of but one colour. Indigo is such a dye, and so are Magenta, Aniline
Black, Aniline Violet, picric acid, Ultramarine Blue, and so on.
Ultramarine is not, it is true, confined to blue; you can get
Ultramarine Green, and even rose-coloured Ultramarine; but still, in
the hands of the dyer, each shade remains as it came from the
colour-maker, and so Ultramarine is a monogenetic colour. Monogenetic
means capable of generating one. Turning to the other class, which
comprises, as we have shown, Alizarin, and, besides, the colouring
principle of logwood (Haematein), Gallein, and Cochineal, etc., we have
bodies usually possessed of some colour, it is true, but such colour is
of no consequence, and, indeed, is of no use to dyers. These bodies
require a special treatment to bring out or develop the colours, for
there may be several that each is capable of yielding. We may consider
them as colour-giving principles, and so we term them _polygenetic_
colours. Polygenetic means capable of generating several or many. In the
various colours and dyes we have all phases, and the monogenetic shades
almost imperceptibly into the polygenetic. The mode of application of
the two classes of colours is, of course, in each case quite essentially
different, for in the case of the monogenetic class the idea is mainly
either to dye at once and directly upon, the unprepared fibre, or having
subjected the fabric to a previous preparation with a metallic or other
solution, to fix directly the one colour on that fabric, on which,
without such preparation, it would be loose. In the case of the
polygenetic class, the idea is necessarily twofold. The dyeing materials
are not colours, only colour generators. Hence in all cases the fabric
must be prepared with the twofold purpose--first, of using a metallic or
other agent, capable of yielding, with the dye material, the desired
colour; and secondly, of yielding it on the fibre in an insoluble and
permanent form. Now, though I have gone so far into this mode of
classification, because it does afford some information and light, yet I
can go no farther without getting into a territory that presupposes a
knowledge and acquaintance with the chemical structure of the colouring
matters as organic substances, which would be, at present, beyond us. I
shall now turn to another mode of classification, which, if not so
far-reaching as the other, is at least an exceedingly useful one. The
two methods may be combined to a considerable extent. By the latter plan
the colours may be conveniently divided into three groups: I.,
substantive colours; II., adjective colours; III., mineral and pigment
colours.

_Substantive Dyestuffs._--The substantive colours fix themselves readily
and directly on animal fibres and substances, but only a few amongst
them will dye vegetable fibres like cotton and linen directly. Almost
all substantive colours may, however, be fixed on cotton and linen by
first preparing or mordanting those vegetable fibres. Silk, wool, fur,
etc., act like fibre and mordant together, for they absorb and fix the
substantive colours firmly. In our experiments we saw that turmeric is
one of the few substantive colours fixing itself on both cotton and
wool, without any aid from a mordant or fixing agent. Magenta was also a
substantive colour, but Alizarin was certainly not one of this class.

_Adjective Dyestuffs._--Some of these substances are definitely coloured
bodies, but in some of them the colour is of no consequence or value,
and is quite different and distinct from the colour eventually formed on
the fibre, which colour only appears in conjunction with a special
mordant; but, again, some of them are not coloured, and would not colour
the fibre directly at all, only in conjunction with some mordant. All
the polygenetic colours are, of course, comprised in this class, for
example Alizarin and logwood (Haematein), whilst such monogenetic colours
as annatto and turmeric are substantive, for they will fix themselves
without a mordant on cotton and wool. The adjective colours can be
conveniently subdivided into--(_a_) those existing in nature, as logwood
(Haematein) and Cochineal; (_b_) those artificially formed from coal-tar
products, as Alizarin (madder), Gallein, etc.

_Mineral and Pigment Dyestuffs._--These colours are insoluble in water
and alcohol. They are either fixed on the fibre by mechanical means or
by precipitation. For example, you use blacklead or plumbago to colour
or darken your hats, and you work on this pigment colour by mechanical
means. I will show you by experiment how to fix a coloured insoluble
pigment in the fibre. I take a solution of acetate of lead (sugar of
lead), and to it I add some solution of bichrome (potassium bichromate).
Acetate of lead (soluble in water) with bichromate of potash (also
soluble in water) yields, on mixing the two, acetate of potash (soluble
in water), and chromate of lead, or chrome yellow (insoluble in water),
and which is consequently precipitated or deposited. Now suppose I boil
some of that chrome-yellow precipitate with lime-water, I convert that
chrome yellow into chrome orange. This, you see, takes place without any
reference to textile fibres. I will now work a piece of cotton in a lead
solution, so that the little tubes of the cotton fibre shall be filled
with it just as the larger glass tube or vessel was filled in the first
experiment. I next squeeze and wash the piece, so as to remove
extraneous solution of lead, just as if I had filled my glass tube by
roughly dipping it bodily into the lead solution, and then washed and
cleansed the outside of that tube. Then I place the fabric in a warm
solution of bichromate of potash (bichrome), when it becomes dyed a
chrome yellow, for just as chromate of lead is precipitated in the glass
tube, so it is now precipitated in the little tubes of the cotton fibre
(see Lecture I.). Let us see if we can now change our chrome yellow to
chrome orange, just as we did in the glass vessel by boiling in
lime-water. I place the yellow fabric in boiling lime-water, when it is
coloured or dyed orange. In each little tubular cotton fibre the same
change goes on as went on in the glass vessel, and as the tube or glass
vessel looks orange, so does the fabric, because the cotton fibres or
tubes are filled with the orange chromium compound. You see this is
quite a different process of pigment colouring from that of rubbing or
working a colour mechanically on to the fibre.

Let us now turn to the substantive colours (Group I.), and see if we can
further sub-divide this large group for the sake of convenience. We can
divide the group into two--(_a_) such colours as exist ready formed in
nature, and chiefly occur in plants, of which the following are the most
important: indigo, archil or orchil, safflower, turmeric, and annatto;
(_b_) the very large sub-group of the artificial or coal-tar colours. We
will briefly consider now the dyestuffs mentioned in Group (_a_).

_Natural Substantive Colours._--Indigo, one of the most valuable dyes,
is the product of a large number of plants, the most important being
different species of _indigofera_, which belong to the pea family. None
of the plants (of which _indigofera tinctoria_ is the chief) contain the
colouring matter in the free state, ready-made, so to say, but only as a
peculiar colourless compound called _indican_, first discovered by
Edward Schunck. When this body is treated with dilute mineral acids it
splits up into Indigo Blue and a kind of sugar. But so easily is this
change brought about that if the leaf of the plant be only bruised, the
decomposition ensues, and a blue mark is produced through separation of
the Indigo Blue. The possibility of dyeing with Indigo so readily and
easily is due to the fact that Indigo Blue absorbs hydrogen from bodies
that will yield it, and becomes, as we say, reduced to a body without
colour, called Indigo White, a body richer in hydrogen than Indigo Blue,
and a body that is soluble. If this white body (Indigo White) be exposed
to the air, the oxygen of the air undoes what the hydrogen did, and
oxidises that Indigo White to insoluble Indigo Blue. Textile fabrics
dipped in such reduced indigo solutions, and afterwards exposed to the
air, become blue through deposit in the fibres of the insoluble Indigo
Blue, and are so dyed. This is called the indigo-vat method. We can
reduce this indigo so as to prepare the indigo-vat by simply mixing
Indigo Blue, copperas (ferrous sulphate) solution, and milk of lime in a
closely-stoppered bottle with water, and letting the mixture stand. The
clear liquor only is used. A piece of cotton dipped in it, and exposed
to the air, quickly turns blue by absorbing oxygen, and is thus dyed.
The best proportions for the indigo-vat are, for cloth dyeing, 4000
parts of water, 40 of indigo, 60 to 80 of copperas crystals, and 50 to
100 of dry slaked lime. The usual plan is to put in the water first,
then add the indigo and copperas, which should be dissolved first, and
finally to add the milk of lime, stirring all the time. Artificial
indigo has been made from coal-tar products. The raw material is a
coal-tar naphtha called toluene or toluol, which is also the raw
material for saccharin, a sweetening agent made from coal-tar. This
artificial indigo is proving a formidable rival to the natural product.

Orchil paste, orchil extract, and cudbear are obtained by exposing the
plants (species of lichens) containing the colouring principle, called
_Orcin_, itself a colourless substance, to the joint action of ammonia
and air, when the oxygen of the air changes that orcin by oxidising it
into _Orcein_, which is the true red colouring matter contained in the
preparations named. The lichens thus treated acquire gradually a deep
purple colour, and form the products called "cudbear." This dye works
best in a neutral bath, but it will do what not many dyes will, namely,
dye in either a slightly alkaline or slightly acid bath as well. Orchil
is not applicable in cotton dyeing. Being a substantive colour no
mordants are needed in dyeing silk and wool with it. The colour produced
on wool and silk is a bright magenta-red with bluish shade.

Litmus is also obtained from the same lichens as yield orchil. It is not
used in dyeing, and is a violet-blue colouring matter when neither acid
nor alkaline, but neutral as it is termed. It turns red with only a
trace of acid, and blue with the least trace of alkali, and so forms a
very delicate reagent when pieces of paper are soaked with it, and
dipped into the liquids to be tested.

Safflower: This vegetable dyeing material, for producing pink colours on
cotton without the aid of a mordant, consists of the petals of the
flower of _carthamus tinctorius_. It contains a principle termed
"Carthamin" or "carthamic acid," which can be separated by exhausting
safflower with cold acidulated water (sulphuric acid) to dissolve out a
yellow colouring matter which is useless. The residue after washing free
from acid is treated with a dilute solution of soda crystals, and the
liquid is then precipitated by an acid. A red precipitate is obtained,
which fixes itself directly on cotton thread immersed in the liquid, and
dyes it a delicate rose pink, which is, unfortunately, very fugitive.
Silk can be dyed like cotton. The colour is not fast against light.

Turmeric is the root portion of a plant called _curcuma tinctoria_, that
grows in Southern Asia. The principle forming the colouring matter is
"Curcumin." It is insoluble in cold water, not much soluble in hot, but
easily soluble in alcohol. From the latter solution it separates in
brilliant yellow crystals. Although the colour it yields is very
fugitive, the wool and silk dyers still use it for producing especially
olives, browns, and similar compound shades. It produces on cotton and
wool a bright yellow colour without the aid of any mordant. To show you
how easily dyeing with turmeric is effected, I will warm some powdered
turmeric root in a flask with alcohol, and add the extract to a vessel
of water warmed to about 140 deg. F. (60 deg. C.), and then dip a piece of
cotton in and stir it about, when it will soon be permanently dyed a
fine bright yellow. A piece of wool similarly worked in the bath is also
dyed. However, the unfortunate circumstance is that this colour is fast
neither to light nor alkalis. Contact with soap and water, even, turns
the yellow-dyed cotton, reddish-brown.

Annatto is a colouring principle obtained from the pulpy matter
enclosing the seeds of the fruit of a tree, the _Bixa orellana_, growing
in Central and Southern America. The red or orange colour it yields is
fugitive, and so its use is limited, being chiefly confined to silk
dyeing. The yellow compound it contains is called "Orellin," and it also
contains an orange compound called "Bixin," which is insoluble in water,
but readily soluble in alkalis and in alcohol with a deep yellow colour.
To dye cotton with it, a solution is made of the colour in a boiling
solution of carbonate of soda. The cotton is worked in the diluted
alkaline solution whilst hot. By passing the dyed cotton through water
acidulated with a little vitriol or alum, a redder tint is assumed. For
wool and silk, pale shades are dyed at 106 deg. F. (50 deg. C.) with the
addition of soap to the bath, dark shades at 200 deg. to 212 deg. F. (80 deg. to
100 deg. C.).




LECTURE X

DYESTUFFS AND COLOURS--_Continued_


_Artificial Substantive Dyestuffs._--You may remember that in the last
lecture we divided the colouring matters as follows: I. Substantive
colours, fixing themselves directly on animal fibres without a mordant,
only a few of them doing this, however, on vegetable fibres, like
cotton. We sub-divided them further as--(_a_) those occurring in nature,
and (_b_) those prepared artificially, and chiefly, but not entirely,
the coal-tar colouring matters. II. Adjective colours, fixing themselves
only in conjunction with a mordant or mordants on animal or vegetable
fibres, and including all the polygenetic colours. III. Mineral or
pigment colours. I described experiments to illustrate what we mean by
monogenetic and polygenetic colours, and indicating that the monogenetic
colours are mainly included in the group of substantive colours, whilst
the polygenetic colours are mainly included in the adjective colours.
But I described also an illustration of Group III., the mineral or
pigment colours, by which we may argue that chromate of lead is a
polygenetic mineral colour, for, according to the treatment, we were
able to obtain either chrome yellow (neutral lead chromate) or chrome
orange (basic lead chromate). I also said there was a kind of borderland
whichever mode of classification be adopted. Thus, for example, there
are colours that are fixed on the fibre either directly like indigo, and
so are substantive, or they may be, and generally are, applied with a
mordant like the adjective and polygenetic colours; examples of these
are Coerulein, Alizarin Blue, and a few more. We have now before us a
vast territory, namely, that of the _b_ group of substantive colours,
or, the largest proportion, indeed almost all of those prepared from
coal-tar sources; Alizarin, also prepared from coal-tar, belongs to the
adjective colours. With regard to the source of these coal-tar colours,
the word "coal-tar," I was going to say, speaks volumes, for the
destructive and dry distillation of coal in gas retorts at the highest
temperatures to yield illuminating gas, also yields us tar. But, coal
distilled at lower temperatures, as well as shale, as in Scotland, will
yield tar, but tar of another kind, from which colour-generating
substances cannot be obtained practically, but instead, paraffin oil and
paraffin wax for making candles, etc. Coal-tar contains a very large
number of different substances, but only a few of them can be extracted
profitably for colour-making. All the useful sources of colours and dyes
from coal-tar are simply compounds of carbon and hydrogen--hydrocarbons,
as they are called, with the exception of one, namely, phenol, or
carbolic acid. I am not speaking here of those coal-tar constituents
useful for making dyes, but of those actually extracted from coal-tar
for that purpose, _i.e._ extracted to profit. For example, aniline is
contained in coal-tar, but if we depended on the aniline contained ready
made in coal-tar for our aniline dyes, the prices of these dyes would
place them beyond our reach, would place them amongst diamonds and
precious stones in rarity and cost, so difficult is it to extract the
small quantity of aniline from coal-tar. The valuable constituents
actually extracted are then these: benzene, toluene, xylene,
naphthalene, anthracene, and phenol or carbolic acid. One ton of
Lancashire coal, when distilled in gas retorts, yields about 12 gallons
of coal-tar. Let us now learn what those 12 gallons of tar will give us
in the shape of hydrocarbons and carbolic acid, mentioned as extracted
profitably from tar. This is shown very clearly in the following table
(Table A).

The 12 gallons of tar yield 1-1/10 lb. of benzene, 9/10 lb. of toluene,
1-1/2 lb. of carbolic acid, between 1/10 and 2/10 lb. of xylene, 6-1/2
lb. of naphthalene, and 1/2 lb. of anthracene, whilst the quantity of
pitch left behind is 69-1/2 lb. But our table shows us more; it
indicates to us what the steps are from each raw material to each
colouring matter, as well as showing us each colouring matter. We see
here that our benzene yields us an equal weight of aniline, and the
toluene (9/10 lb.) about 3/4 lb. of toluidine, the mixture giving, on
oxidation, between 1/2 and 3/4 lb of Magenta. From carbolic acid are
obtained both Aurin and picric acid, and here is the actual quantity of
Aurin obtainable (1-1/4 lb.). From naphthalene, either naphthylamine (a
body like aniline) or naphthol (resembling phenol) may be prepared. The
amounts obtainable you see in the table. There are two varieties of
naphthol, called alpha- and beta-naphthol, but only one phenol, namely,
carbolic acid. Naphthol Yellow is of course a naphthol colour, whilst
Vermilline Scarlet is a dye containing both naphthylamine and naphthol.
You see the quantities of these dyes, namely 7 lb. of Scarlet and 9-1/2
lb. of the Naphthol Yellow. The amount of pure anthracene obtained is
1/2 lb. This pure anthracene exhibits the phenomenon of fluorescence,
that is, it not only looks white, but when the light falls on it, it
seems to reflect a delicate violet or blue light. Our table shows us
that from the 12 gallons of tar from 1 ton of coal we may gain 2-1/4 lb.
of 20 per cent. Alizarin paste. Chemically pure Alizarin crystallises in
bright-red needles; it is the colouring principle of madder, and also of
Alizarin paste. But the most wonderful thing about substantive coal-tar
colours is their immense tinctorial power, _i.e._ the very little
quantity of each required compared with the immense superficies of cloth
it will dye to a full shade.

The next table (see Table B) shows you the dyeing power of the colouring
matters derived from 1 ton of Lancashire coal, which will astonish any
thoughtful mind, for the Magenta will dye 500 yards of flannel, the
Aurin 120 yards, the Vermilline Scarlet 2560 yards, and the Alizarin 255
yards (Turkey-red cotton cloth).

The next table (Table C) shows the latent dyeing power resident, so to
speak, in 1 lb. of coal.

By a very simple experiment a little of a very fine violet dye can be
made from mere traces of the materials. One of the raw materials for
preparing this violet dye is a substance with a long name, which itself
was prepared from aniline. This substance is
tetramethyldiamidobenzophenone, and a little bit of it is placed in a
small glass test-tube, just moistened with a couple of drops of another
aniline derivative called dimethylaniline, and then two drops of a
fuming liquid, trichloride of phosphorus, added. On simply warming this
mixture, the violet dyestuff is produced in about a minute. Two drops of
the mixture will colour a large cylinder of water a beautiful violet.
The remainder (perhaps two drops more) will dye a skein of silk a bright
full shade of violet. Here, then, is a magnificent example of enormous
tinctorial power. I must now draw the rein, or I shall simply transport
you through a perfect wonderland of magic, bright colours and apparent
chemical conjuring, without, however, an adequate return of solid
instruction that you can carry usefully with you into every-day life and
practice.

Before we go another step, I must ask and answer, therefore, a few
questions. Can we not get some little insight into the structure and
general mode of developing the leading coal-tar colours which serve as
types of whole series? I will try what can be done with the little
knowledge of chemistry we have so far accumulated. In our earlier
lectures we have learnt that water is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen,
and in its compound atom or molecule we have two atoms of hydrogen
combined with one of oxygen, symbolised as H_{2}O. We also learnt that
ammonia, or spirits of hartshorn, is a compound of hydrogen with
nitrogen, three atoms of hydrogen being combined with one of nitrogen,
thus, NH_{3}. An example of a hydrocarbon or compound of carbon and
hydrogen, is marsh gas (methane) or firedamp, CH_{4}. Nitric acid, or
_aqua fortis_, is a compound of nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, one atom
of the first to three of the second and one of the third--NO_{3}H. But
this nitric acid question forces me on to a further statement, namely,
we have in this formula or symbol, NO_{3}H, a twofold idea--first, that
of the compound as a whole, an acid; and secondly, that it is formed
from a substance without acid properties by the addition of water,
H_{2}O, or, if we like, HOH. This substance contains the root or radical
of the nitric acid, and is NO_{2}, which has the power of replacing one
of the hydrogen atoms, or H, of water, and so we get, instead of HOH,
NO_{2}OH, which is nitric acid. This is chemical replacement, and on
such replacement depends our powers of building up not only colours, but
many other useful and ornamental chemical structures. You have all heard
the old-fashioned statement that "Nature abhors a vacuum." We had a very
practical example of this when in our first lecture on water I brought
an electric spark in contact with a mixture of free oxygen and hydrogen
in a glass bulb. These gases at once united, three volumes of them
condensing to two volumes, and these again to a minute particle of
liquid water. A vacuum was left in that delicate glass bulb whilst the
pressure of the atmosphere was crushing with a force of 15 lb. on the
square inch on the outside of the bulb, and thus a violent crash was the
result of Nature's abhorrence. There is such a kind of thing, though,
and of a more subtle sort, which we might term a chemical vacuum, and it
is the result of what we call chemical valency, which again might be
defined as the specific chemical appetite of each substance.

Let us now take the case of the production of an aniline colour, and let
us try to discover what aniline is, and how formed. I pointed to benzene
or benzol in the table as a hydrocarbon, C_{6}H_{6}, which forms a
principal colour-producing constituent of coal-tar. If you desire to
produce chemical appetite in benzene, you must rob it of some of its
hydrogen. Thus C_{6}H_{5} is a group that would exist only for a moment,
since it has a great appetite for H, and we may say this appetite would
go the length of at once absorbing either one atom of H (hydrogen) or of
some similar substance or group having a similar appetite. Suppose, now,
I place some benzene, C_{6}H_{6}, in a flask, and add some nitric acid,
which, as we said, is NO_{2}OH. On warming the mixture we may say a
tendency springs up in that OH of the nitric acid to effect union with
an H of the C_{6}H_{6} (benzene) to form HOH (water), when an appetite
is at once left to the remainder, C_{6}H_{5}--on the one hand, and the
NO_{2}--on the other, satisfied by immediate union of these residues to
form a substance C_{6}H_{6}NO_{2}, nitro-benzene or "essence of
mirbane," smelling like bitter almonds. This is the first step in the
formation of aniline.

I think I have told you that if we treat zinc scraps with water and
vitriol, or water with potassium, we can rob that water of its oxygen
and set free the hydrogen. It is, however, a singular fact that if we
liberate a quantity of fresh hydrogen amongst our nitrobenzene
C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2}, that hydrogen tends to combine, or evinces an
ungovernable appetite for the O_{2} of that NO_{2} group, the tendency
being again to form water H_{2}O. This, of course, leaves the residual
C_{6}H_{5}N: group with an appetite, and only the excess of hydrogen
present to satisfy it. Accordingly hydrogen is taken up, and we get
C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2} formed, which is aniline. I told you that ammonia is
NH_{3}, and now in aniline we find an ammonia derivative, one atom of
hydrogen (H) being replaced by the group C_{6}H_{5}. I will now describe
the method of preparation of a small quantity of aniline, in order to
illustrate what I have tried to explain in theory. Benzene from coal-tar
is warmed with nitric acid in a flask. A strong action sets in, and on
adding water, the nitrobenzene settles down as a heavy oil, and the acid
water can be decanted off. After washing by decantation with water once
or twice, and shaking with some powdered marble to neutralise excess of
acid, the nitrobenzene is brought into contact with fresh hydrogen gas
by placing amongst it, instead of zinc, some tin, and instead of
vitriol, some hydrochloric acid (spirits of salt). To show you that
aniline is formed, I will now produce a violet colour with it, which
only aniline will give. This violet colour is produced by adding a very
small quantity of the aniline, together with some bleaching powder, to a
mixture of chalk and water, the chalk being added for the purpose of
destroying acidity. This aniline, C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2}, is a base, and forms
the foundation of all the so-called basic aniline colours. If I have
made myself clear so far, I shall be contented. It only remains to be
said that for making Magenta, pure aniline will not do, what is used
being a mixture of aniline, with an aniline a step higher, prepared from
toluene. If I were to give you the formula of Magenta you would be
astonished at its complexity and size, but I think now you will see that
it is really built up of aniline derivatives. Methyl Violet is a colour
we have already referred to, and its chemical structure is still more
complex, but it also is built up of aniline materials, and so is a basic
aniline colour. Now it is possible for the colour-maker to prepare a
very fine green dye from this beautiful violet (Methyl Violet). In fact
he may convert the violet into the green colour by heating the first
under pressure with a gas called methyl chloride (CH_{3}Cl). Methyl
Violet is constructed of aniline or substituted aniline groups; the
addition of CH_{3}Cl, then, gives us the Methyl Green. But one of the
