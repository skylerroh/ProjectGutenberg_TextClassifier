"We are not on Earth," she said firmly, in her soft, mellow voice. "We
don't have to follow terrestrial customs, and we shouldn't. There's only

"And that is...?" asked Marguerite drily.

"Polygamy, of course. He must belong to us all."

Betsy shuddered but, surprisingly, she nodded.

"That's well and good," agreed Marguerite, "but we have to agree that no
one of us will be favored above the others. He has to understand that
from the start."

"That's fair," said Alice, pursing her lips. "Yes, that's fair. But I
agree with Marguerite: he must be divided equally among the four of us."

face. As always, Herbert had not required a direct command to accede to
their wishes.

The man was divided into four quarters, one for each of them. It was a
very neat surgical job.
