 About Meyer Moldeven


Meyer (Mike) Moldeven was a civilian logistics
technician with the United States Air Force
from 1941 until 1974. He was an aircraft
emergency survival equipment specialist
in the Pacific Area during World War II and a
technical writer for several years afterwards.
During the Cold War he transferred to a USAF
base in North Africa where he developed logistics
plans for USAF-NATO emergency maintenance
of disabled aircraft that would land along the
North African coast after returning from missions
in any future war with the USSR. During the U.S.
post-Sputnik initiatives to create a national space
program, he critiqued aerospace industries' logistics
concepts on future space systems organization,
infrastructure and support. Among the studies
he critiqued was 'Space Logistics, Operations,
Maintenance and Rescue' (Project SLOMAR).
During the Viet Nam War, he was the senior
civilian in the Inspector General's Office at
McClellan Air Force Base, a major logistics
installation near Sacramento, California. As
part of his 'added' duties during 'Viet Nam' Mike
was a hotline volunteer in a suicide prevention
center and consequently, an advocate for
professionally-staffed 'suicide prevention'
capabilities throughout the entire Department
of Defense. He compiled documentation,
published, and widely distributed copies of
his book, "Military-Civilian Teamwork in
Suicide Prevention" (1971, 1985 and 1994.)
Mike's updated essay on suicide prevention
in the U.S. Armed Forces has been included
in his collection of memoirs, "Hot War/Cold War
-- Back-of-the-Lines Logistics", which is at:

 The Preface


 "It is difficult to say
 what is impossible,
 for the dream of yesterday
 is the hope of today and
 the reality of tomorrow."
 -- Dr. Robert H. Goddard


 "There is no way back into the past;
 the choice, as H. G. Wells once said,
 is the universe -- or nothing.
 Though men and civilizations
 may yearn for rest, for the
 dream of the lotus-eaters,
 that is a desire that merges
 imperceptibly into death.
 The challenge of the great
 spaces between the worlds
 is a stupendous one; but
 if we fail to meet it,
 the story of our race will
 be drawing to its close."
 -- Arthur C. Clarke





 The Prologue


 The Present

A conclusion in the Report to the Club of Rome:
The Limits to Growth states: "...within a time span
of less than 100 years with no major change in
the physical, economic, or social relationships that
have traditionally governed world development,
society will run out of the nonrenewable resources
on which the industrial base depends. When the
resources have been depleted, a precipitous
collapse of the economic system will result,
manifested in massive unemployment, decreased
food production, and a decline in population as the
death rate soars. There is no smooth transition,
no gradual slowing down of activity; rather, the
economic system consumes successively larger
amounts of the depletable resources until they
are gone. The characteristic behavior of the
system is overshoot and collapse."

Jeremy Rifkin, President of the Foundation on
Economic Trends and the Greenhouse Crisis
Foundation, in Biosphere Politics: A New
Consciousness for a New Century (Crown Publishers,
New York 1991) reports how industrialized and
developed nations exploit the sea beds of the world
for their rich deposits of industrial minerals and
metals. He notes that the struggle between rich
and poor nations and multinational corporations over
minerals in the vast oceanic seabed is likely to be
heated in the years to come, especially as reserves
of land-based minerals approach exhaustion.

News media reported in October 2000 that the
People's Republic of China announced plans to
explore Earth's moon for useful substances. On
October 15, 2003 the PRC launched into Earth
orbit its first manned rocket.

In a speech on January 14, 2004 the President of
the United States of America unveiled a new vision
for space exploration. He called on the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to
"...gain a new foothold on the moon and to prepare
for new journeys to worlds beyond our own."

"We do not know where this journey will end," said
the President, "yet we know this: Human beings are
headed into the cosmos." White House Press Release,
January 14, 2004.

 The Future

 The Interstellar Mining and Teleport System

The System consists of two terminals, each of
which includes an integral, fully robotized capability
to conduct internal command-and-control,
self-maintenance and repair, and logistical,
teleportation, communications and other functions
and operations essential to its unique mission. The
terminal positioned in orbit above Alpha Centauri is
designated the Extractor and the terminal positioned
along the Solar System's rim is designated the
Collector.

The Extractor selects and draws pre-designated
elements, minerals and other usable substances
from the Alpha Centauri star system, and collects,
accumulates, converts and channels the matter
into its spunnel transmission subsystem for direct
interstellar transfer to the Collector.

The Collector receives the product, converts
it into its original form, identifies, classifies,
quantifies and records constituents and mass;
refines and ejects the raw product for transport
to and storage along the solar rim or at a location
that Authority determines to be more suitable.

The Extractor and Collector terminals are
constructed four million kilometers beyond Planet
Pluto. During the System's research, development,
test, evaluation, engineering, construction, launch
and voyage phases, the terminals are spunnel-linked
and tested both as separate machines with their
support systems, and as the integrated master
scheme.

During construction the System is linked to Planet
Pluto, employing mass attractors, orbital dynamics
controls and stabilizers, and other means, as
appropriate.

The System Authority possesses and Commands a
Self-Defense Force under Powers delegated by the
President of the United Inner Planetary System
(UIPS).

At launch, disengage the Extractor fleet from the
Solar System's gravitational and other constraints
employing Planet Pluto's outbound orbital momentum
plus augmentation thrusters in a manner that the
Extractor fleet retains its integrity in transit to
destination, and on station in perpetuity.

Position the Extractor in orbit above Alpha
Centauri at a location commensurate with data
provided previously by drone scouts. Authority,
at all times, maintains surveillance and exercises
control over operations and support systems, and
analyses of the Extractor's functions, structures
and equipment.

The Collector is positioned along the solar rim, or
elsewhere, as determined by Authority. The Collector
is fixed to the Extractor's product launch nodes,
functions and operations, and to the Extractor's
orbital dynamics at destination.

The Extractor, operating at destination, analyzes,
selects, and draws substance from proximate
asteroids, comets, satellites, planetoids, space
debris, swarms, star surfaces, subsurface and other
accessible bodies and strata, reduces the substance
to teleportable constituents (the product), loads
the product into launch hoppers and dispatches
it to the Collector.

Critical to the program's success is timing the
Extractor's launch. Piggy-backed to Planet Pluto
during construction, the Extractor uses the
planet's orbital momentum for launch. The launch
window is precise and short-lived along Planet
Pluto's outbound orbit; there is only one launch
opportunity in centuries for the Extractor.

Disengaged from Pluto, the Extractor fleet
accelerates along its course to optimum velocity
through integrated thrust of augmented thrusters
or other more advanced propulsion systems that
are or become available in time to accomplish the
Objective.

 ##

The Terminals and their command and control,
supporting research and development schemes
and projects, facilities, spunnel teleport and other
logistics and communications networks, surface and
space stations and outposts is formally designated
The Interstellar Mining and Transport System.
Authority acknowledges that the mission, launch and
assets acquisition processes intrigued the whimsical
fancy of the solar community during pre-program
definition studies and the System was nicknamed
"Slingshot".





 THE UNIVERSE
 -- or nothing





 Chapter ONE


The recon-patroller's leg and torso-pads fine-tuned
their tensions as Lieutenant Pete O'Hare shifted
position. His eyes ranged the banks of flickering
lights around him. An aberrant indicator caught his
eye and he mind-stroked a sensor control. Satisfied,
he moved on; the greens held firm.

Planet Pluto arced into view from starboard, half
a million kay distant. The mottled moonlet, Charon,
orbited the mother planet tightly. Only tanktown
Coldfield's dome and its hard unblinking lights
broke Pluto's drab crust. A dozen or so rutted
trails formed a network that connected encapsulated
outposts to each other and to Pluto's solitary city.

The recon-patroller's omni-directional screen
displayed the huge cylinder that floated in space
behind him, its gravity-enhanced rotation barely
perceptible to O'Hare's vision. Five-meter high
orange letters glowed brightly along its blunt
bow and stern, and on each quarter sector of its
exposed surface, proclaiming the huge cylinder
as the UIPS SLINGSHOT LOGISTICS DEPOT.

Space transports, no two alike, rode their
magnetic-beam's moorings along the Depot's flanks.
Space tugs and barges labored in all directions,
taxis charged about, and space-cranes swayed above
dozens of platforms that protruded from the Depot's
hull.

Leviathans off-loaded to barges as other ships in a
multitude of shapes and sizes grappled with cargo
from flex-conveyers that snaked from the Depot's
gaping portals. Slender, multi-armed space cranes
raised and lowered crates, bundles and modules, and
arranged, aligned, connected and disconnected gear
and cargo in all directions.

Aggregations of netted or tethered girders,
platforms, multi-meter-wide conduits in hundreds
of shapes and lengths, and modules linked by
stabilizer-beams crossed open spaces, pulled or
pushed by robot tugs controlled from the station's
cargo control centers. In trains or clusters,
machines traversed the open stretches between
the Depot's portals and nearby transports in their
final step toward a long journey.

The brightly checkered Depot slipped from O'Hare's
screen. A deployment station to O'Hare and hundreds
of his colleagues, and to more than four centuries
of his predecessors, the Depot was as much home
to him as his permanent station afloat in space
between Earth and Luna.

"Time," O'Hare silently flashed the code that
opened his spunnel channel to Keeper. "This is a
Slingshot Tac Ops from Red Fox to Keeper. I am hot
to trot on Point Charlie off Fandango Force Field.
All coordinates green for Scout Operation Xray
Delta slash Four. Time for go is 2112 slash 14
Solar. Keyed to transmit status on Spunnel Channel
9212, scramble 38. Confirm. Over."

The response was equally silent, registered
directly in his consciousness. The message's
clarity was unaffected by passage through
hundreds of spunnel boosters that linked O'Hare
to a shielded bunker beneath Luna's surface.

"Keeper to Red Fox. Your orders to scout Planet
Pluto Zone confirmed. You are cleared to start
at 2112 slash 14 Solar. Spunnel 9212 slash 38 is
