
"What ho?" came a cheery voice, which he recognized as belonging to
Huges, commander of the _Los Angeles_.

Breathing a sigh of relief, he explained the situation. Busy days
followed. _Hexoxen_ and Europium from the _San Francisco_ were
transferred to the other ships, with as much of the treasure collected
by the pirates as could be loaded into the cramped quarters.

With Huges and Rogers assisting, Holden revised the schedule for
planting the charges.

"We simply haven't time," he explained, "to set the charges as close
together as I had planned. There's nothing to do but get all of them in
that we can, and then hope that conditions in the interior of the moon
will be of a nature to promote the action of the _hexoxen_."

The ships' crews understood only too well the importance and danger of
their work, and during the days that followed they toiled like a gang of
madmen. Parties raced each other over the rough surface of the dead
satellite, grimly determined that their efforts to save the world should
not be in vain. Even the men of the party which had been rescued,
weakened as they were by their long stay in the pirate cave, insisted on
giving what help they could.

Finally came the day when the first charges were set to go off. Holden
sat in the pilot room of the _Ganymede_, his eyes on the chronometer,
while Captain Linet swept the desolate plain with powerful binoculars
for the cloud of dust which would signal the return of the last party.

"Five minutes yet, Captain," Holden said in a low voice. "Tell the _Los
Angeles_ to pull out. The first charges are scarcely two hundred miles
from here, and I'm not certain how fast the reaction will travel."

Five minutes. Two minutes. The silver shape of the _Los Angeles_ was
already fading in the distance. Suddenly a sharp shock rocked the stony
bed on which the _Ganymede_ was resting. Simultaneously five figures
appeared, racing at full speed for the ship. Shock after shock tore at
the ground beneath their feet. Holden stood at the controls, waiting for
the signal that his five comrades were safely aboard. To his tensed
nerves it seemed hours before the welcome sound came to his ears, and
with a sigh of relief he opened the power into the stern tubes, and
laughed happily as the huge ship shot away from the heaving surface of
the dying moon.

Anxious seconds passed. From the height to which they had risen, a great
part of the moon was visible, and for the first time Holden realized the
full power of the chemical which his ingenuity had devised. Immense
tongues of flame ripped through the dust and rock of the satellite,
sending dense clouds of vapor bellowing out into space. Mighty mountains
disappeared in an instant.

The _Ganymede_ was traveling at full speed, and yet it seemed as though
at any moment the conflagration might reach out, consuming the space
ship in that all-engulfing reaction. Holden manipulated the controls
with flying fingers, seeking to get every available bit of speed from
the metal monster which was carrying its precious cargo of human beings
away from a terrible death.

Far ahead he could see the shape of the _Los Angeles_, now safely
outside the danger zone. Thin clouds of vapor floated around the
_Ganymede_, then suddenly cleared.

Captain Linet gave a shout of joy as he read the distance recorded on
the dials. "Jack, my boy, we're safe. We're outside the limit to which
the reaction can extend."

With the three ships playing their deadly beams on the moon, Holden
watched the immense craters, the towering mountains, and the desolate
plains of the moon slowly vaporize.

It was an awe-inspiring sight, as this dead world slowly melted into the
nothingness of space, as though a disease of matter were wasting it
inexorably away.

No doubt, on the earth, as the contours of the moon slowly blurred and
became indistinct, with the accumulation of vapor around its now ragged
rim, there must have been terror and consternation. And as the moon
slowly evaporated in the skies a virtual panic must have ensued among
the Earth's people.

The hand of a terrible fate, or the coming of the end of the world, must
have been shouted from city to city as the only explanation of this
apparent disaster in the heavens.

But the work had to go on....

For days, the _Ganymede_ and the _Los Angeles_ cruised through the thin
clouds, spreading between them the anti-gravitational shield, while the
sections of vapor, freed of their mutual attraction, drifted out into
uncharted space.

It was slow, dangerous work, cutting those sections off from the main
mass, and maintaining the proper position until they had floated off
into space. Occasional particles of rock, small but deadly, clattered
against the hard shell of the space ship. Fortunately, no fragments of
appreciable size were encountered; the _hexoxen_ had done its work
thoroughly. For eight days the powerful ray sliced and repelled. Under
its influence huge clouds of vapor, the ghostly remains of the calm
globe which had innocently threatened the earth, hurtled off into the
farthest reaches of space, there to sink at last into the substance of
some flaming star.

At last the work was finished, and the two ships, saviors of the Earth,
turned their bows toward home to carry to the awestruck people of Earth
the glad news that interplanetary commerce would be as free of pirates
thereafter as the Earth would be free of the disastrous quakes.

And Jack Holden, at last, faced with a light heart the honors that would
be his, knowing that he could now share them with the girl of his
dreams.
