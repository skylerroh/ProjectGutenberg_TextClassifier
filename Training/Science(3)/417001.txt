
*89. Circumscribed triangle.*  The hexagon may further degenerate into a
triangle, giving the theorem (Fig. 24) _The lines joining the vertices to
the points of contact of the opposite sides of a triangle circumscribed
about a conic all meet in a point._




*90.*  Brianchon's theorem may also be used to solve the following
problems:

_Given four tangents and the point of contact on any one of them, to
construct other tangents to a conic. Given three tangents and the points
of contact of any two of them, to construct other tangents to a conic._




*91. Harmonic tangents.*  We have seen that a variable tangent cuts out on
any two fixed tangents projective point-rows. It follows that if four
tangents cut a fifth in four harmonic points, they must cut every tangent
in four harmonic points. It is possible, therefore, to make the following
definition:

_Four tangents to a conic are said to be harmonic when they meet every
other tangent in four harmonic points._




*92. Projectivity and perspectivity.*  This definition suggests the
possibility of defining a projective correspondence between the elements
of a pencil of rays of the second order and the elements of any form
heretofore discussed. In particular, the points on a tangent are said to
be _perspectively related_ to the tangents of a conic when each point lies
on the tangent which corresponds to it. These notions are of importance in
the higher developments of the subject.

                                 FIG. 25




*93.*  Brianchon's theorem may also be applied to a degenerate conic made
up of two points and the lines through them. Thus(Fig. 25),

_If __a__, __b__, __c__ are three lines through a point __S__, and __a'__,
__b'__, __c'__ are three lines through another point __S'__, then the
lines __l = (ab', a'b)__, __m = (bc', b'c)__, and __n = (ca', c'a)__ all
meet in a point._




*94. Law of duality.*  The observant student will not have failed to note
the remarkable similarity between the theorems of this chapter and those
of the preceding. He will have noted that points have replaced lines and
lines have replaced points; that points on a curve have been replaced by
tangents to a curve; that pencils have been replaced by point-rows, and
that a conic considered as made up of a succession of points has been
replaced by a conic considered as generated by a moving tangent line. The
theory upon which this wonderful _law of duality_ is based will be
developed in the next chapter.

3. Given any five lines in the plane, construct on each the point of
contact with the conic tangent to them all.

the conic.

problems 6 to 10 inclusive, parallel lines are to be drawn.)





CHAPTER VI - POLES AND POLARS




*95. Inscribed and circumscribed quadrilaterals.*  The following theorems
have been noted as special cases of Pascal's and Brianchon's theorems:

_If a quadrilateral be inscribed in a conic, two pairs of opposite sides
and the tangents at opposite vertices intersect in four points, all of
which lie on a straight line._

_If a quadrilateral be circumscribed about a conic, the lines joining two
pairs of opposite vertices and the lines joining two opposite points of
contact are four lines which meet in a point._

                               [Figure 26]

                                 FIG. 26




*96. Definition of the polar line of a point.*  Consider the quadrilateral
_K_, _L_, _M_, _N_ inscribed in the conic (Fig. 26). It determines the
four harmonic points _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_ which project from _N_ in to the
four harmonic points _M_, _B_, _K_, _O_. Now the tangents at _K_ and _M_
meet in _P_, a point on the line _AB_. The line _AB_ is thus determined
entirely by the point _O_. For if we draw any line through it, meeting the
conic in _K_ and _M_, and construct the harmonic conjugate _B_ of _O_ with
respect to _K_ and _M_, and also the two tangents at _K_ and _M_ which
meet in the point _P_, then _BP_ is the line in question. It thus appears
that the line _LON_ may be any line whatever through _O_; and since _D_,
_L_, _O_, _N_ are four harmonic points, we may describe the line _AB_ as
the locus of points which are harmonic conjugates of _O_ with respect to
the two points where any line through _O_ meets the curve.




*97.*  Furthermore, since the tangents at _L_ and _N_ meet on this same
line, it appears as the locus of intersections of pairs of tangents drawn
at the extremities of chords through _O_.




*98.*  This important line, which is completely determined by the point
_O_, is called the _polar_ of _O_ with respect to the conic; and the point
_O_ is called the _pole_ of the line with respect to the conic.




*99.*  If a point _B_ is on the polar of _O_, then it is harmonically
conjugate to _O_ with respect to the two intersections _K_ and _M_ of the
line _BC_ with the conic. But for the same reason _O_ is on the polar of
_B_. We have, then, the fundamental theorem

_If one point lies on the polar of a second, then the second lies on the
polar of the first._




*100. Conjugate points and lines.*  Such a pair of points are said to be
_conjugate_  with respect to the conic. Similarly, lines are said to be
_conjugate_  to each other with respect to the conic if one, and
consequently each, passes through the pole of the other.

                               [Figure 27]

                                 FIG. 27




*101. Construction of the polar line of a given point.* Given a point _P_,
if it is within the conic (that is, if no tangents may be drawn from _P_
to the conic), we may construct its polar line by drawing through it any
two chords and joining the two points of intersection of the two pairs of
tangents at their extremities. If the point _P_ is outside the conic, we
may draw the two tangents and construct the chord of contact (Fig. 27).




*102. Self-polar triangle.*  In Fig. 26 it is not difficult to see that
_AOC_ is a _self-polar_ triangle, that is, each vertex is the pole of the
opposite side. For _B_, _M_, _O_, _K_ are four harmonic points, and they
project to _C_ in four harmonic rays. The line _CO_, therefore, meets the
line _AMN_ in a point on the polar of _A_, being separated from _A_
harmonically by the points _M_ and _N_. Similarly, the line _CO_ meets
_KL_ in a point on the polar of _A_, and therefore _CO_ is the polar of
_A_. Similarly, _OA_ is the polar of _C_, and therefore _O_ is the pole of
_AC_.




*103. Pole and polar projectively related.*  Another very important
theorem comes directly from Fig. 26.

_As a point __A__ moves along a straight line its polar with respect to a
conic revolves about a fixed point and describes a pencil projective to
the point-row described by __A__._

For, fix the points _L_ and _N_ and let the point _A_ move along the line
_AQ_; then the point-row _A_ is projective to the pencil _LK_, and since
_K_ moves along the conic, the pencil _LK_ is projective to the pencil
_NK_, which in turn is projective to the point-row _C_, which, finally, is
projective to the pencil _OC_, which is the polar of _A_.




*104. Duality.*  We have, then, in the pole and polar relation a device
for setting up a one-to-one correspondence between the points and lines of
the plane--a correspondence which may be called projective, because to four
harmonic points or lines correspond always four harmonic lines or points.
To every figure made up of points and lines will correspond a figure made
up of lines and points. To a point-row of the second order, which is a
conic considered as a point-locus, corresponds a pencil of rays of the
second order, which is a conic considered as a line-locus. The name
'duality' is used to describe this sort of correspondence. It is important
to note that the dual relation is subject to the same exceptions as the
one-to-one correspondence is, and must not be appealed to in cases where
the one-to-one correspondence breaks down. We have seen that there is in
Euclidean geometry one and only one ray in a pencil which has no point in
a point-row perspective to it for a corresponding point; namely, the line
parallel to the line of the point-row. Any theorem, therefore, that
involves explicitly the point at infinity is not to be translated into a
theorem concerning lines. Further, in the pencil the angle between two
lines has nothing to correspond to it in a point-row perspective to the
pencil. Any theorem, therefore, that mentions angles is not translatable
into another theorem by means of the law of duality. Now we have seen that
the notion of the infinitely distant point on a line involves the notion
of dividing a segment into any number of equal parts--in other words, of
_measuring_. If, therefore, we call any theorem that has to do with the
line at infinity or with the measurement of angles a _metrical_ theorem,
and any other kind a _projective_ theorem, we may put the case as follows:

_Any projective theorem involves another theorem, dual to it, obtainable
by interchanging everywhere the words 'point' and 'line.'_




*105. Self-dual theorems.*  The theorems of this chapter will be found,
upon examination, to be _self-dual_; that is, no new theorem results from
applying the process indicated in the preceding paragraph. It is therefore
useless to look for new results from the theorem on the circumscribed
quadrilateral derived from Brianchon's, which is itself clearly the dual
of Pascal's theorem, and in fact was first discovered by dualization of
Pascal's.




*106.*  It should not be inferred from the above discussion that
one-to-one correspondences may not be devised that will control certain of
the so-called metrical relations. A very important one may be easily found
that leaves angles unaltered. The relation called _similarity_ leaves
ratios between corresponding segments unaltered. The above statements
apply only to the particular one-to-one correspondence considered.




PROBLEMS


1. Given a quadrilateral, construct the quadrangle polar to it with
respect to a given conic.

2. A point moves along a straight line. Show that its polar lines with
respect to two given conics generate a point-row of the second order.

3. Given five points, draw the polar of a point with respect to the conic
passing through them, without drawing the conic itself.

4. Given five lines, draw the polar of a point with respect to the conic
tangent to them, without drawing the conic itself.

5. Dualize problems 3 and 4.

6. Given four points on the conic, and the tangent at one of them, draw
the polar of a given point without drawing the conic. Dualize.

7. A point moves on a conic. Show that its polar line with respect to
another conic describes a pencil of rays of the second order.

_Suggestion._ Replace the given conic by a pair of protective pencils.

8. Show that the poles of the tangents of one conic with respect to
another lie on a conic.

9. The polar of a point _A_ with respect to one conic is _a_, and the pole
of _a_ with respect to another conic is _A'_. Show that as _A_ travels
along a line, _A'_ also travels along another line. In general, if _A_
describes a curve of degree _n_, show that _A'_ describes another curve of
the same degree _n_. (The degree of a curve is the greatest number of
points that it may have in common with any line in the plane.)





CHAPTER VII - METRICAL PROPERTIES OF THE CONIC SECTIONS




*107. Diameters. Center.*  After what has been said in the last chapter
one would naturally expect to get at the metrical properties of the conic
sections by the introduction of the infinite elements in the plane.
Entering into the theory of poles and polars with these elements, we have
the following definitions:

The polar line of an infinitely distant point is called a _diameter_, and
the pole of the infinitely distant line is called the _center_, of the
conic.




*108.*  From the harmonic properties of poles and polars,

_The center bisects all chords through it (§ 39)._

_Every diameter passes through the center._

_All chords through the same point at infinity (that is, each of a set of
parallel chords) are bisected by the diameter which is the polar of that
infinitely distant point._




*109. Conjugate diameters.*  We have already defined conjugate lines as
lines which pass each through the pole of the other (§ 100).

_Any diameter bisects all chords parallel to its conjugate._

_The tangents at the extremities of any diameter are parallel, and
parallel to the conjugate diameter._

_Diameters parallel to the sides of a circumscribed parallelogram are
conjugate._

All these theorems are easy exercises for the student.




*110. Classification of conics.*  Conics are classified according to their
relation to the infinitely distant line. If a conic has two points in
common with the line at infinity, it is called a _hyperbola_; if it has no
point in common with the infinitely distant line, it is called an
_ellipse_; if it is tangent to the line at infinity, it is called a
_parabola_.




*111.* _In a hyperbola the center is outside the curve_ (§ 101), since the
two tangents to the curve at the points where it meets the line at
infinity determine by their intersection the center. As previously noted,
these two tangents are called the _asymptotes_ of the curve. The ellipse
and the parabola have no asymptotes.




*112.*  _The center of the parabola is at infinity, and therefore all its
diameters are parallel,_ for the pole of a tangent line is the point of
contact.

_The locus of the middle points of a series of parallel chords in a
parabola is a diameter, and the direction of the line of centers is the
same for all series of parallel chords._

_The center of an ellipse is within the curve._

                               [Figure 28]

                                 FIG. 28




*113. Theorems concerning asymptotes.*  We derived as a consequence of the
theorem of Brianchon (§ 89) the proposition that if a triangle be
circumscribed about a conic, the lines joining the vertices to the points
of contact of the opposite sides all meet in a point. Take, now, for two
of the tangents the asymptotes of a hyperbola, and let any third tangent
cut them in _A_ and _B_ (Fig. 28). If, then, _O_ is the intersection of
the asymptotes,--and therefore the center of the curve,-- then the triangle
_OAB_ is circumscribed about the curve. By the theorem just quoted, the
line through _A_ parallel to _OB_, the line through _B_ parallel to _OA_,
and the line _OP_ through the point of contact of the tangent _AB_ all
meet in a point _C_. But _OACB_ is a parallelogram, and _PA = PB_.
Therefore

_The asymptotes cut off on each tangent a segment which is bisected by the
point of contact._




*114.*  If we draw a line _OQ_ parallel to _AB_, then _OP_ and _OQ_ are
conjugate diameters, since _OQ_ is parallel to the tangent at the point
where _OP_ meets the curve. Then, since _A_, _P_, _B_, and the point at
infinity on _AB_ are four harmonic points, we have the theorem

_Conjugate diameters of the hyperbola are harmonic conjugates with respect
to the asymptotes._




*115.*  The chord _A"B"_, parallel to the diameter _OQ_, is bisected at
_P'_ by the conjugate diameter _OP_. If the chord _A"B"_ meet the
asymptotes in _A'_, _B'_, then _A'_, _P'_, _B'_, and the point at infinity
are four harmonic points, and therefore _P'_ is the middle point of
_A'B'_. Therefore _A'A" = B'B"_ and we have the theorem

_The segments cut off on any chord between the hyperbola and its
asymptotes are equal._




*116.*  This theorem furnishes a ready means of constructing the hyperbola
by points when a point on the curve and the two asymptotes are given.

                               [Figure 29]

                                 FIG. 29




*117.*  For the circumscribed quadrilateral, Brianchon's theorem gave (§
88) _The lines joining opposite vertices and the lines joining opposite
points of contact are four lines meeting in a point._ Take now for two of
the tangents the asymptotes, and let _AB_ and _CD_ be any other two (Fig.
29). If _B_ and _D_ are opposite vertices, and also _A_ and _C_, then _AC_
and _BD_ are parallel, and parallel to _PQ_, the line joining the points
of contact of _AB_ and _CD_, for these are three of the four lines of the
theorem just quoted. The fourth is the line at infinity which joins the
point of contact of the asymptotes. It is thus seen that the triangles
_ABC_ and _ADC_ are equivalent, and therefore the triangles _AOB_ and
_COD_ are also. The tangent AB may be fixed, and the tangent _CD_ chosen
arbitrarily; therefore

_The triangle formed by any tangent to the hyperbola and the two
asymptotes is of constant area._




*118. Equation of hyperbola referred to the asymptotes.* Draw through the
point of contact _P_ of the tangent _AB_ two lines, one parallel to one
asymptote and the other parallel to the other. One of these lines meets
_OB_ at a distance _y_ from _O_, and the other meets _OA_ at a distance
_x_ from _O_. Then, since _P_ is the middle point of _AB_, _x_ is one half
of _OA_ and _y_ is one half of _OB_. The area of the parallelogram whose
adjacent sides are _x_ and _y_ is one half the area of the triangle _AOB_,
and therefore, by the preceding paragraph, is constant. This area is equal
to _xy . __sin__ {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}_, where {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} is the constant angle between the asymptotes.
It follows that the product _xy_ is constant, and since _x_ and _y_ are
the oblique cooerdinates of the point _P_, the asymptotes being the axes of
reference, we have

_The equation of the hyperbola, referred to the asymptotes as axes, is
__xy =__ constant._

This identifies the curve with the hyperbola as defined and discussed in
works on analytic geometry.




                               [Figure 30]

                                 FIG. 30


*119. Equation of parabola.* We have defined the parabola as a conic which
is tangent to the line at infinity (§ 110). Draw now two tangents to the
curve (Fig. 30), meeting in _A_, the points of contact being _B_ and _C_.
These two tangents, together with the line at infinity, form a triangle
circumscribed about the conic. Draw through _B_ a parallel to _AC_, and
through _C_ a parallel to _AB_. If these meet in _D_, then _AD_ is a
diameter. Let _AD_ meet the curve in _P_, and the chord _BC_ in _Q_. _P_
is then the middle point of _AQ_. Also, _Q_ is the middle point of the
chord _BC_, and therefore the diameter _AD_ bisects all chords parallel to
_BC_. In particular, _AD_ passes through _P_, the point of contact of the
tangent drawn parallel to _BC_.

Draw now another tangent, meeting _AB_ in _B'_ and _AC_ in _C'_. Then
these three, with the line at infinity, make a circumscribed
quadrilateral. But, by Brianchon's theorem applied to a quadrilateral (§
88), it appears that a parallel to _AC_ through _B'_, a parallel to _AB_
through _C'_, and the line _BC_ meet in a point _D'_. Also, from the
similar triangles _BB'D'_ and _BAC_ we have, for all positions of the
tangent line _B'C_,

                         _B'D' : BB' = AC : AB,_
