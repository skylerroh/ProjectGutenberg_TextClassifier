number of people for so few and such small houses. I think the
village is mostly underground, and the houses are just entrances,
soundproofed, to shelter them from uncomfortable natural
noises--thunderstorms, for instance."

The horn was braying in the snooper-screen speaker; somebody
wondered what it was for. Gofredo laughed.

"I thought, at first, that it was a war-horn. It isn't. It's a
peace-horn," he said. "Public tranquilizer. The first day, they
brought it out and blew it at us to make us peaceable."

"Now I see why Sonny is rejected and persecuted," Anna was saying.
"He must make all sorts of horrible noises that he can't hear ...
that's not the word; we have none for it ... and nobody but his
mother can stand being near him."

"Like me," Lillian said. "Now I understand. Just think of the most
revolting thing that could be done to you physically; that's what I
do to them every time I speak. And I always thought I had a nice
voice," she added, pathetically.

"You have, for Terrans," Ayesha said. "For Svants, you'll just
have to change it."

"But how--?"

"Use an analyzer; train it. That was why I took up sonics, in
the first place. I had a voice like a crow with a sore throat,
but by practicing with an analyzer, an hour a day, I gave myself
an entirely different voice in a couple of months. Just try to
get some pump-sound frequencies into it, like Luis'."

"But why? I'm no use here. I'm a linguist, and these people haven't
any language that I could ever learn, and they couldn't even learn
ours. They couldn't learn to make sounds, as sounds."

"You've been doing very good work with Mom on those ideographs,"
Meillard said. "Keep it up till you've taught her the Lingua Terra
Basic vocabulary, and with her help we can train a few more. They
can be our interpreters; we can write what we want them to say to
the others. It'll be clumsy, but it will work, and it's about the
only thing I can think of that will."

"And it will improve in time," Ayesha added. "And we can make
vocoders and visibilizers. Paul, you have authority to requisition
personnel from the ship's company. Draft me; I'll stay here and
work on it."

The rumpus in the village plaza was getting worse. The Lord Mayor
and his adherents were being out-shouted by the opposition.

"Better do something about that in a hurry, Paul, if you don't want
a lot of Svants shot," Gofredo said. "Give that another half hour
and we'll have visitors, with bows and spears."

"Ayesha, you have a recording of the pump," Meillard said. "Load a
record-player onto a jeep and fly over the village and play it for
them. Do it right away. Anna, get Mom in here. We want to get her to
tell that gang that from now on, at noon and for a couple of hours
after sunset, when the work's done, there will be free public
pump-concerts, over the village plaza."

       *       *       *       *       *

Ayesha and her warrant-officer helper and a Marine lieutenant
went out hastily. Everybody else faced the screen to watch. In
fifteen minutes, an airjeep was coming in on the village. As it
circled low, a new sound, the steady _thugg-thugg, thugg-thugg_
of the pump, began.

The yelling and twittering and the blaring of the peace-horn died out
almost at once. As the jeep circled down to housetop level, the two
contending faction-clumps broke apart; their component individuals
moved into the center of the plaza and squatted, staring up, letting
the delicious waves of sound caress them.

"Do we have to send a detail in a jeep to do that twice a day?"
Gofredo asked. "We keep a snooper over the village; fit it with
a loud-speaker and a timer; it can give them their _thugg-thugg_,
on schedule, automatically."

"We might give the Lord Mayor a recording and a player and let him
decide when the people ought to listen--if that's the word--to it,"
Dorver said. "Then it would be something of their own."

"No!" He spoke so vehemently that the others started. "You know
what would happen? Nobody would be able to turn it off; they'd
all be hypnotized, or doped, or whatever it is. They'd just sit
in a circle around it till they starved to death, and when the
power-unit gave out, the record-player would be surrounded by
a ring of skeletons. We'll just have to keep on playing it for
them ourselves. Terrans' Burden."

"That'll give us a sanction over them," Gofredo observed. "Extra
_thugg-thugg_ if they're very good; shut it off on them if they act
nasty. And find out what Lillian has in her voice that the rest of
us don't have, and make a good loud recording of that, and stash it
away along with the rest of the heavy-weapons ammunition. You know,
you're not going to have any trouble at all, when we go down-country
to talk to the king or whatever. This is better than fire-water ever
was."

"We must never misuse our advantage, Luis," Meillard said seriously.
"We must use it only for their good."

He really meant it. Only--You had to know some general history to
study technological history, and it seemed to him that that pious
assertion had been made a few times before. Some of the others who
had made it had really meant it, too, but that had made little
difference in the long run.

Fayon and Anna were talking enthusiastically about the work ahead of
them.

"I don't know where your subject ends and mine begins," Anna was
saying. "We'll just have to handle it between us. What are we going
to call it? We certainly can't call it hearing."

"Nonauditory sonic sense is the only thing I can think of," Fayon
said. "And that's such a clumsy term."

"Mark; you thought of it first," Anna said. "What do you think?"

"Nonauditory sonic sense. It isn't any worse than Domesticated
Type C, and that got cut down to size. _Naudsonce._"
