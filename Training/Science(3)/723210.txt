
"And _that_ told you where the _Delphinus_ was?"

"No. But it fitted my hunch about these Gienahns. I'd kind of felt from
the first minute of meeting them that they had a culture like the
Indians of ancient Terra."

"Why?"

"They came in like a primitive raiding party. The leader dropped right
onto the hood of my sled. An act of bravery, no less. Counting coup, you
see?"

"I guess so."

"Then he said he was High Path Chief. That wasn't on the language list,
either. But it was easy: _Raider Chief._ There's a word in almost every
language in history that means raider and derives from a word for road,
path or highway."

"Highwaymen," said Stetson.

"Raid itself," said Orne. "An ancient Terran language corruption of
road."

"Yeah, yeah. But where'd all this translation griff put--"

"Don't be impatient. Glass-blowing culture meant they were just out of
the primitive stage. That, we could control. Next, he said their moon
was _Chiranachuruso_, translated as _The Limb of Victory_. After that it
just fell into place."

"How?"

"The vertical-slit pupils of their eyes. Doesn't that mean anything to
you?"

"Maybe. What's it mean to you?"

"Night-hunting predator accustomed to dropping upon its victims from
above. No other type of creature ever has had the vertical slit. And
Tanub said himself that the _Delphinus_ was hidden in the best place in
all of their history. History? That'd be a high place. Dark, likewise.
Ergo: a high place on the darkside of their moon."

"I'm a pie-eyed greepus," whispered Stetson.

Orne grinned, said: "You probably are ... sir."
