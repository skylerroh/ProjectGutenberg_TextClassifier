     Time-traveler from the Twentieth Century: "So this is the
     year 24,000 A.D.?"

     Time-Traveler: "Say, Sulsu-D-9, has Astounding Stories
     brought out a Quarterly yet?"

     Sulsu-D-9: "No, Man from the Long Ago, but it looks like
     we'll have one within the next five years!"--Forrest J.

_An Employment Non-Solution_

     Dear Editor:

     Owing to the fact that I have been a constant Reader of
     Astounding Stories since the first day it appeared on the
     news-stands, I think that it is about time for me to drop a
     few lines to you to show my appreciation for the many, many
     good stories that you have given the Readers of Science
     Fiction in the pages of your mag.

     I agree very strongly with Mr. Sager of Bessemer, Ala.,
     about the paper in the book. If the stories are interesting,
     why in the name of Seven Kinds of Hades should anyone worry
     about the kind of paper as long as the print is readable.
     What is that old saying about the best articles not being
     always in the best wrapped parcels? I am here to say that
     Astounding Stories is the best of its kind.

     What I have to say now is by no means a criticism. I am
     merely asking for an explanation. I have no regard for those
     people who are continually looking for flaws to peck about
     in various stories.

     In the May, 1931, issue my choice of all the fine stories
     was "Dark Moon." That was a super-story and I enjoyed it
     from start to finish, even the third or fourth time I read
     it. If a story is worth reading once it is worth reading
     several times, is my belief. But now comes the question.
     Will some other kind Reader endeavor to explain it to me?

     How could the intrepid explorers on the Dark Moon see the
     light of Earth and the other planets if the light from the
     Dark Moon could not pass the gaseous formation to Earth,
     etc.? And how could the Dark Moon receive the light that it
     did? [Mr. Diffin did not explain that; perhaps he intends to
     do so in a sequel. Who knows?--_Ed._].

     One main fault I have to find with Astounding Stories is
     that it is not published twice a month, if not oftener. By
     the way, would that not be a plan to help out unemployment.
     It would put more men to work and I am sure that all of us
     Readers could scrape up 20c more a month for this wonderful
     magazine. How about it? [But this, I think, would _increase_
     unemployment!--_Ed._].

     I would like to hear from some of the Readers in the near
     future. Best wishes for the continued prosperity of the
     magazine.--Christen G. Davis, 531 South Millard, Chicago,
     Ill.


_Doggoned If He Didn't!_

     Dear Editor:

     The stories, being the most important part of the magazine,
     come first:

     "Dark Moon," by Charles W. Diffin, is the best novelette you
     have yet published, and that's saying a lot for it, isn't
     it?

     Next comes "The Exile of Time," by Ray Cummings, another
     impossible time-traveling story, but nevertheless
     interesting.

     Welcome to Astounding Stories, Mr. Schachner and Mr. Zagat.
     Your story "The Death Cloud" was great. I hope you'll favor
     us with another story very soon.

     And if here isn't Capt. Meek with another Dr. Bird story!
     Captain Meek, if you stop writing them, I'll never read
     another of your marvelous stories.

     The moon turned green, and I'll be doggone if Hal K. Wells
     didn't go and write a nice little story telling us all about
     it. That was nice of you, Mr. Wells; I enjoyed it very, very
     much.

     Now let's take a look at the cover. Mr. Wesso, you certainly
     have a marvelous imagination. You are an excellent cover
     artist. It isn't everyone that can illustrate Science
     Fiction stories, I do wish that you will illustrate Science
     Fiction stories only, as that is where you are at your best.
     Almost any artist can illustrate detective story magazines,
     so don't waste your talent on them.

     Ha! Here we are at the "In the Next Issue" page.

     Hurrah! Hurrah! Arthur J. Burks is back again! Can't you
     manage to get next month's issue out a little earlier, Mr.
     Bates? R. F. Starzl's also back again; and there's to be
     another story by Charles W. Diffin. Isn't this a grand old
     world?

     I will close with this suggestion. Let's have more
     illustrations. At least two for each installment of the
     serials and two for each long novelette. Make the extra
     illustrations full page ones.--Jack Darrow, 4225 N.
     Spaulding Ave., Chicago, Ill.


"--_And Amusing_"

     Dear Editor:

     I have just finished the May issue of A. S. and I want to
     tell you that "Dark Moon," by Charles W. Diffin, was fine.
     Let's have more stories like that. Your "The Readers'
     Corner" sure is interesting--and amusing. I like to read
     letters from Readers.

     A bouquet: A. S. is a really fine magazine. I think it's one
     of the best of its kind. Of course, it can be improved--but
     what can't? There's no sense in criticizing a magazine as
     some Readers do. I think if the Editor could make his
     magazine any better, he would do it without
     hesitation.--Charles Strada, 503 Olive Street, Kansas City,
     Mo.


_Cummings and Wagner_

     Dear Editor:

     Astounding Stories is in my estimation the best magazine on
     the market. Words are feeble when an accurate description of
     the pleasure that I receive from every issue of Astounding
     Stories is needed. However, I will say that next to my
     extreme appreciation of classical music, I rate Astounding
     Stories as being the best outlet of my emotions. As in the
     music of that great German composer, Richard Wagner, whom I
     rate as the greatest of all composers, so do I find an
     outlet of my emotions by reading a novelette by Cummings,
     Vincent, Leinster and many other of your excellent Authors.

     For example, I shall take the overture to "The Flying
     Dutchman." In the beginning of this overture we hear the
     opening call played by the trombones with the string section
     accompanying this principal motive with wild crescendo. This
     excites the brain so that a taste of the supreme motives is
     like an appetizer at dinner. So, taking the novel by Ray
     Cummings entitled "Beyond the Vanishing Point," we find that
     in the opening paragraphs there is also an "appetizer" to
     the rest of the story which is to follow.

     Now, returning to our "Flying Dutchman" overture, we find
     that after the introduction by the wild calls by the
     trombones and the string accompaniment, we gradually drift
     into a somewhat pensive mood; so in the story, for the next
     few pages we find more or less quiet reading. Gradually,
     however, this quiet mood in the music gives way to rolls on
     the kettle-drums announcing a grand climax; finally the
     music becomes wilder and wilder until at last the storm
     breaks and we actually picture this ghost-ship riding over
     the waves in a terrific storm. Lightning flashes, thunder
     roars, huge waves sweep over the deck of the ship as we see
     the Dutchman at the wheel laughing out his defiance in
     diabolical fury.

     And so in the story we are finally led up to a grand climax
     which actually grips anyone with an ounce of red blood in
     his veins.

     And now I would like to ask the following questions:

     Is there some Reader of Astounding Stories who no longer has
     any use for the old issues of Astounding Stories and would
     be so kind as to send me these? From the first issue up to
     the November, 1930, issue and also the December, 1930, issue
     are the magazines that I should like to have.

     Leave your magazine as is, only have one good long
     novelette, not two fairly good ones as in your April issue,
     which was not up to the standard set by your previous
     magazines.--Walter G. Diehl, 145-38 Eighth Ave., Malba, L.
     I., N. Y.


_This Time-Traveling Traffic_

     Dear Editor:

     Many times during the past months, while reading your really
     remarkable magazine, I have come across contradictions in
     explanations throughout the stories, which, while not very
     serious, tend to give me the impression that the Authors
     either did not care about or did not see through the errors
     they committed. I did not complain about them, considering
     them but minor mistakes.

     But in Ray Cummings' latest current novel, "The Exile of
     Time," there exists such a monstrosity as I believe calls
     for an explanation.

     Mr. Cummings' story, you know, centers around his
     time-traveling machine. If such a thing were possible, would
     it not be reasonable to believe that a holder of the secret
     of time-traveling could go back into the past and prevent
     some catastrophe or tragedy as his historical knowledge of
     the event would make possible?

     According to this theory then, a person could go back into
     the past and divert the hand of Wilkes Booth on April 15,
     1865, about to assassinate Lincoln.

     But this shows its own impossibilities: that of two
     contradicting absolute truths for the world to believe.

     Likewise, a person could travel into the future, learn of
     his own death, go back into his own time and take measures
     to prevent it. In the same way, this could not be. [But Mr.
     Cummings explains that these things are impossible.--_Ed._]

     I do not mean to be critical, but it would lend much more
     interest to the story if the authors would be a bit more
     careful.--Robert W. Conrad, Rush City, Minn.


_Tripe?_

     Dear Editor:

     In the short time your mag. has been out, it has already
     established itself as the best in the field. I got a real
     kick out of most of your stories.

     In the May issue, two yarns are outstanding: Charles W.
     Diffin's splendid "Dark Moon" and Nat Schachner and Arthur
     L. Zagat's especially fine "The Death Cloud." These two are
     as thrilling stories as I have ever read. Mr. Diffin I've
     read before and always enjoyed; but Messrs. Schachner and
     Zagat are new to me. I am looking forward to seeing more of
     their stuff.

     But what has happened to Cummings? He used to be aces up,
     but now comes this tripe of his called "The Exile of Time";
     especially the current installment with its long-winded rot
     about mysticism and theosophy and the Lord knows what. Where
     was the Editor when this blew in? Surely there are plenty of
     Swami sheets for that truck; it has no place in Astounding
     Stories.

     Give us more of Diffin, Leinster, Schachner, Zagat and
     Rousseau, and you'll keep us all satisfied.--D. Kay,
     Standish Arms, Brooklyn, N. Y.


_For Rocket Fans_

     Dear Editor:

     It may interest your Readers to know that the American
     Interplanetary Society has just completed its first year of
     existence, and looks forward to a most energetic second year
     in pursuing its aims.

     The Society has practically completed the first lap of its
     research on the possibilities and limitations of the rocket,
     and intends to continue this research for another year
     before publishing a complete report which shall be the first
     extensive survey of the rocket in English.

     We plan also to extend the size and scope of our monthly
     Bulletin, to make of it a real magazine that shall publish
     all the news, both of America and abroad, dealing with
     developments in astronautics and rocketry. It will also
     contain the reports of the Society's members on the rocket,
     as well as interesting general articles on the various
     phases of interplanetary travel.

     Plans are also maturing for a campaign of mutual
     experimentation on the rocket which we shall be ready to
     carry out before the end of this year. The Society is also
     completing plans for the formation of an International
     Interplanetary Commission which shall coordinate the work of
     the national societies and plan to solve the problems of
     astronautics on a world-wide basis.

     While the growth of the Society during the past year was
     very promising we hope to extend during this year the scope
     and field of our activities and membership. We have members
     now in thirty-six states, in Canada, Mexico, France and
     Russia. To your readers we offer our active and associate
     memberships, giving to lovers of Science Fiction a chance to
     assist in the bringing to realization the dream of all
     interplanetary travel.

     Information about the Society and the classes of membership
     can be obtained by writing to the secretary at the address
     below.--Nathan Schachner, Sec., American Interplanetary
     Society. 113 West 42nd St., New York City.
