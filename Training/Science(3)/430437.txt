"How did you know I was in trouble?" I asked curiously. "How did you
know we had those crooks on board?"

"Why--why," Lucky sputtered, "that was simple. I just happened to look
behind me and I saw those boys piling into you. So I did a little fast
thinking and then I whipped the ship into a few maneuvers and, like the
chief says, they caught his eye all right."

The chief was beaming fondly and I turned my head to hide the smile on
my lips. "So you just looked behind you," I muttered. "Well, Lucky, you
certainly are--and were."

He grinned down at me and winked. "You said it, kid."

I wanted to ask him a question then, but I decided to wait until we were
alone. I closed my eyes and smiled again, thinking of his expression
when I would ask him how he had been able to look behind him and see me
struggling with those crooks, _when the door of the pilot's chamber was
closed all the time_....
