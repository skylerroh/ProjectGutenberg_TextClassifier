PREFACE.


Several cases which I witnessed led me to believe, some years ago, that
inflammation of the brain, or its membranes, might be produced in
children, owing to their being suckled for an undue length of time.
Since that period, having enjoyed opportunities of observing infantile
diseases on a much more extended scale, and my attention being expressly
directed to the point in question, I not only became fully convinced of
the correctness of my previous conclusions, but was induced to carry
them still farther.

My opinions on this subject were briefly drawn up and published in the
_Medical and Physical Journal_ for August 1827, and have not passed
altogether unnoticed by my professional brethren[1], some of whom have
done me the honour to speak of them in flattering terms, while no one, I
believe, has attempted to disprove the existence of the important fact I
was the first to announce.

[1] Vide Medico-Chirurgical Review, Gazette of Health, Dendy on
Cutaneous Diseases, &c.

The bare statement of that fact was, indeed, nearly all that my
approaching departure from England, at the time last mentioned, left in
my power: upon the present occasion I have offered arguments for, and
endeavoured to anticipate those against, the deductions I then made
public; and however imperfect may have been my success in either, the
welfare of society at large is too deeply involved in the establishment
of my opinions with respect to the custom I condemn, (if those opinions
be correct,) for me to hesitate while again committing them to the press
in a more extended form.

These considerations, I respectfully submit, will render any apology for
the appearance of the following pages unnecessary, and will, I trust,
secure for them a candid and favourable reception from the Profession
and the Public.
