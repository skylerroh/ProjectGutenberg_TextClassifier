
"Funny," said one of the younger scientists, "that the moonplant went so
far afield for meteors, and yet did not disturb the delicate
gravitational balance between Earth and the moon, its own Satellite."

"Let us hope," said an older scientist, "that this enormous Australian
network has not been saving itself for us." He laughed at this little
pleasantry, but no one joined him, because someone had just peered
through a telescope and noticed that Australia seemed to be getting
larger.

"You know what?" said the young scientist, finally. "We're falling to
the Earth, to form the largest pockmark of all!"

"What a spectacle!" cried another scientist. "Pity we won't be alive to
witness it. I wonder why the Peter W. Merrill Moonplant saved us for
last?"

"Possibly," said the young scientist, "because--as with a wedding--the
groom asks all his relatives to come and see him married, and finally
picks out the person who is to be the Best Man. The moonplant probably
considers the moon an old buddy."

The older scientists, however, gave this statement the stoniest of
non-replies, and refused even to speak to the hapless young man for the
duration of their journey downward to squashy death against the home
planet.

Romanticism and Science just don't mix.
