"So they hauled her back to Terra, I suppose."

"Oh, no. The relatives are fighting that out, too. So, until the judges
get their injunctions shuffled and dealt, little Kathi is sitting out
there viewing the Rockies and the stars."

He looked up at Dudley's stifled exclamation.

"Well, it's good and cold out there," he said defensively. "We don't
have any spare space around here to store delayed shipments, you know.
We're waitin' to see who gets possession."

Dudley rose, his face white. He was abruptly conscious once more of
other conversations around them, as he stalked toward the exit.

"Hey," Fisher called after him, "that redhead, Eileen, told me to ask
if you're taking her out tonight."

Dudley paused. He ran a hand over his face. "Yeah, I guess so," he said.

He went out, thinking, _I should have taken her. The hell with
regulations and Jack's theories about her being born too soon to be
useful on Mars. She might have straightened out._

He headed for the tunnel that led to the loading domes.

Ericsson was a large crater, over a hundred miles across and with a
beautifully intact ringwall, so it took him some hours, even with the
tractor he borrowed, to go as far as the edge of the crater. Jack Fisher
was waiting for him in the surface dome when he returned hours later.

"Welcome back," he said, chewing nervously on his cigar. "I was
wondering if we'd have to go looking for you." He looked relieved.

"How did she look?" he asked casually, as Dudley climbed out of his
space suit in the locker room.

Dudley peeled off the one-piece suit he had worn under the heating pads.
He sniffed.

"Chee-rist, I need a shower after that.... She looked all right. Pretty
cute, in a way. Like she was happy here on Luna."

He picked up towel and soap. "So I fixed it so she could stay," he
added.

"What do you mean?"

He looked at Fisher. "Are you asking as a friend or as a cop?"

"What difference does it make?" asked Fisher.

"Well, I don't think you could have tracked me with your radar past the
ringwall, so maybe I just went for a ride and a little stroll, huh? You
didn't see me bring back a shovel, did you?"

"No," said Fisher, "I didn't see you bring it back. But some people are
going to get excited about this, Pete. Where did you bury her?"

"Blood-suckers!" said Dudley. "Let them get excited! Luna is full of
mysteries."

"All right," said Fisher. "For my own curiosity, then, I'm asking as a
friend."

"I found a good place," said Dudley. "I kind of forget where, in the
middle of all those cliffs and rills, but it had a nice view of the
stars. They'll never find her to take her back! I think I owed her that
much."

"Ummm," grunted Fisher.

As Dudley entered the shower, the other began to unwrap a new cigar, a
not-displeased expression settling over his square, pudgy face.

Under the slow-falling streams of warm water, Dudley gradually began to
relax. He felt the stiffness ease out of his jaw muscles. He turned off
the bubbling water before he could begin imagining he was hearing a
scared voice pleading again for passage to Mars....
