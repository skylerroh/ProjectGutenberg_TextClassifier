that shall he also reap." [30]

Because God is Mind, and this Mind is good, all
is good and all is Mind. God is the sum total of the

[Page 106.]

universe. Then what and where are sin, sickness, and [1]
death?

Christian Science and Christian Scientists will, _must_,
have a history; and if I could write the history in poor
parody on Tennyson's grand verse, it would read [5]
thus:--


    Traitors to right of them,
    M. D.'s to left of them,
    Priestcraft in front of them,
      Volleyed and thundered! [10]
    Into the jaws of hate,
    Out through the door of Love,
    On to the blest above,
      Marched the one hundred.




Extract From My First Address In The Mother Church, May 26, 1895


_Friends and Brethren_:--Your Sunday Lesson, com-
posed of Scripture and its correlative in "Science and
Health with Key to the Scriptures," has fed you. In addi- [20]
tion, I can only bring crumbs fallen from this table of
Truth, and gather up the fragments.

It has long been a question of earnest import, How
shall mankind worship the most adorable, but most
unadored,--and where shall begin that praise that shall
never end? Beneath, above, beyond, methinks I hear [25]
the soft, sweet sigh of angels answering, "So live, that
your lives attest your sincerity and resound His praise."

Music is the harmony of being; but the music of Soul
affords the only strains that thrill the chords of feeling
and awaken the heart's harpstrings. Moved by mind, [30]
your many-throated organ, in imitative tones of many

[Page 107.]

instruments, praises Him; but even the sweetness and [1]
beauty in and of this temple that praise Him, are earth's
accents, and must not be mistaken for the oracles of God.
Art must not prevail over Science. Christianity is not
superfluous. Its redemptive power is seen in sore trials, [5]
self-denials, and crucifixions of the flesh. But these come
to the rescue of mortals, to admonish them, and plant
the feet steadfastly in Christ. As we rise above the seem-
ing mists of sense, we behold more clearly that all the
heart's homage belongs to God. [10]

More love is the great need of mankind. A pure af-
fection, concentric, forgetting self, forgiving wrongs and
forestalling them, should swell the lyre of human love.

Three cardinal points must be gained before poor
humanity is regenerated and Christian Science is dem- [15]
onstrated: (1) A proper sense of sin; (2) repentance;
(3) the understanding of good. Evil is a negation: it
never started with time, and it cannot keep pace with
eternity. Mortals' false senses pass through three states
and stages of human consciousness before yielding error. [20]
The deluded sense must first be shown its falsity through
a knowledge of evil as evil, so-called. Without a sense
of one's oft-repeated violations of divine law, the in-
dividual may become morally blind, and this deplorable
mental state is moral idiocy. The lack of seeing one's [25]
deformed mentality, and of _repentance_ therefor, deep,
never to be repented of, is retarding, and in certain mor-
bid instances stopping, the growth of Christian Scientists.
Without a knowledge of his sins, and repentance so severe
that it destroys them, no person is or can be a Christian [30]
Scientist.

Mankind thinks either too much or too little of sin.

[Page 108.]

The sensitive, sorrowing saint thinks too much of it: the [1]
sordid sinner, or the so-called Christian asleep, thinks too
little of sin.

To allow sin of any sort is anomalous in Christian
Scientists, claiming, as they do, that good is infinite, All. [5]
Our Master, in his definition of Satan as a liar from the
beginning, attested the absolute powerlessness--yea,
nothingness--of evil: since a lie, being without founda-
tion in fact, is merely a falsity; spiritually, literally, it
_is nothing_. [10]

Not to know that a false claim is false, is to be in danger
of believing it; hence the utility of knowing evil aright,
then reducing its claim to its proper denominator,--
nobody and nothing. Sin should be conceived of only
as a delusion. This true conception would remove mortals' [15]
ignorance and its consequences, and advance the second
stage of human consciousness, repentance. The first
state, namely, the knowledge of one's self, the proper
knowledge of evil and its subtle workings wherein evil
seems as real as good, is indispensable; since that which [20]
is truly conceived of, we can handle; but the misconcep-
tion of what we need to know of evil,--or the concep-
tion of it at all as something real,--costs much. Sin
needs only to be known for what it is not; then we are
its master, not servant. Remember, and act on, Jesus' [25]
definition of sin as a _lie_. This cognomen makes it less
dangerous; for most of us would not be seen believing
in, or adhering to, that which we know to be untrue.
What would be thought of a Christian Scientist who be-
lieved in the use of drugs, while declaring that they have [30]
no intrinsic quality and that there is no matter? What
should be thought of an individual believing in that

[Page 109.]

which is untrue, and at the same time declaring the unity [1]
of Truth, and its allness? Beware of those who mis-
represent facts; or tacitly assent where they should dis-
sent; or who take me as authority for what I disapprove,
or mayhap never have thought of, and try to reverse, in- [5]
vert, or controvert, Truth; for this is a sure pretext of
moral defilement.

Examine yourselves, and see what, and how much, sin
claims of you; and how much of this claim you admit
as valid, or comply with. The knowledge of evil that [10]
brings on repentance is the most hopeful stage of mortal
mentality. Even a mild mistake must be seen as a mis-
take, in order to be corrected; how much more, then,
should one's sins be seen and repented of, before they
can be reduced to their native nothingness! [15]

Ignorance is only blest by reason of its nothingness;
for seeing the need of somethingness in its stead, blesses
mortals. Ignorance was the first condition of sin in the
allegory of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. Their
mental state is not desirable, neither is a knowledge of [20]
sin and its consequences, repentance, _per se_; but, ad-
mitting the existence of both, mortals must hasten through
the second to the third stage,--the knowledge of good;
for without this the valuable sequence of knowledge
would be lacking,--even the power to escape from the [25]
false claims of sin. To understand good, one must discern
the nothingness of evil, and consecrate one's life anew.

Beloved brethren, Christ, Truth, saith unto you, "Be
not afraid!"--fear not sin, lest thereby it master you;
but only _fear to sin_. Watch and pray for self-knowledge; [30]
since then, and thus, cometh repentance,--and your
superiority to a delusion is won.

[Page 110.]

Repentance is better than sacrifice. The costly balm [1]
of Araby, poured on our Master's feet, had not the value
of a single _tear_.

Beloved children, the world has need of you,--and
more as children than as men and women: it needs your [5]
innocence, unselfishness, faithful affection, uncontami-
nated lives. You need also to watch, and pray that you
preserve these virtues unstained, and lose them not through
contact with the world. What grander ambition is there
than to maintain in yourselves what Jesus loved, and to [10]
know that your example, more than words, makes morals
for mankind!




Address Before The Alumni Of The Massachusetts Metaphysical College, 1895


_My Beloved Students_:--Weeks have passed into [15]
months, and months into years, since last we met; but
time and space, when encompassed by divine presence,
do not separate us. Our hearts have kept time together,
and our hands have wrought steadfastly at the same
object-lesson, while leagues have lain between us. [20]

We may well unite in thanksgiving for the continued
progress and unprecedented prosperity of our Cause. It
is already obvious that the world's acceptance and the
momentum of Christian Science, increase rapidly as
years glide on. [25]

As Christian Scientists, you have dared the perilous de-
fense of Truth, and have succeeded. You have learned
how fleeting is that which men call great; and how per-
manent that which God calls good.

[Page 111.]

You have proven that the greatest piety is scarcely [1]
sufficient to demonstrate what you have adopted and
taught; that your work, well done, would dignify angels.

Faithfully, as meekly, you have toiled all night; and
at break of day caught much. At times, your net has [5]
been so full that it broke: human pride, creeping into
its meshes, extended it beyond safe expansion; then,
losing hold of divine Love, you lost your fishes, and pos-
sibly blamed others more than yourself. But those whom
God makes "fishers of men" will not pull for the shore; [10]
like Peter, they launch into the depths, cast their nets
on the right side, compensate loss, and gain a higher sense
of the true idea. Nothing is lost that God gives: had He
filled the net, it would not have broken.

Leaving the seed of Truth to its own vitality, it propa- [15]
gates: the tares cannot hinder it. Our Master said,
"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall
not pass away;" and Jesus' faith in Truth must not ex-
ceed that of Christian Scientists who prove its power to
be immortal. [20]

The Christianity that is merely of sects, the pulpit, and
fashionable society, is brief; but the Word of God abideth.
Plato was a pagan; but no greater difference existed be-
tween his doctrines and those of Jesus, than to-day exists
between the Catholic and Protestant sects. I love the [25]
orthodox church; and, in time, that church will love
Christian Science. Let me specially call the attention of
this Association to the following false beliefs inclining
mortal mind more deviously:--

The belief in anti-Christ: that somebody in the flesh [30]
is the son of God, or is another Christ, or is a spiritually
adopted child, or is an incarnated babe, is the evil one--

[Page 112.]

in other words, the one evil--disporting itself with the [1]
subtleties of sin!

Even honest thinkers, not knowing whence they come,
may deem these delusions verities, before they know it,
or really look the illusions in the face. The ages are bur- [5]
dened with material modes. Hypnotism, microbes, X-rays,
and ex-common sense, occupy time and thought; and
error, given new opportunities, will improve them. The
most just man can neither defend the innocent nor detect
the guilty, unless he knows _how_ to be just; and this knowl- [10]
edge demands our time and attention.

The mental stages of crime, which seem to belong to
the latter days, are strictly classified in metaphysics as
some of the many features and forms of what is properly
denominated, in extreme cases, moral idiocy. I visited [15]
in his cell the assassin of President Garfield, and found
him in the mental state called moral idiocy. He had no
sense of his crime; but regarded his act as one of simple
justice, and himself as the victim. My few words touched
him; he sank back in his chair, limp and pale; his flip- [20]
pancy had fled. The jailer thanked me, and said, "Other
visitors have brought to him bouquets, but you have
brought what will do him good."

This mental disease at first shows itself in extreme
sensitiveness; then, in a loss of self-knowledge and of [25]
self-condemnation,--a shocking inability to see one's
own faults, but an exaggerating sense of other people's.
Unless this mental condition be overcome, it ends in a
total loss of moral, intellectual, and spiritual discernment,
and is characterized in this Scripture: "The fool hath [30]
said in his heart, There is no God." This state of mind
is the exemplification of total depravity, and the result

[Page 113.]

of sensuous mind in matter. Mind that is God is not in [1]
matter; and God's presence gives spiritual light, wherein
is no darkness.

If, as is indisputably true, "God is Spirit," and Spirit
is our Father and Mother, and that which it includes is [5]
all that is real and eternal, when evil seems to predomi-
nate and divine light to be obscured, free moral agency
is lost; and the Revelator's vision, that "no man might
buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the
beast, or the number of his name," is imminent. [10]

Whoever is mentally manipulating human mind, and
is not gaining a higher sense of Truth by it, is losing in
the scale of moral and spiritual being, and may be car-
ried to the depths of perdition by his own consent. He
who refuses to be influenced by any but the divine Mind, [15]
commits his way to God, and rises superior to sugges-
tions from an evil source. Christian Science shows that
there is a way of escape from the latter-day ultimatum
of evil, through scientific truth; so that all are without
excuse. [20]

Already I clearly recognize that mental malpractice,
if persisted in, will end in insanity, dementia, or moral
idiocy. Thank God! this evil can be resisted by true
Christianity. Divine Love is our hope, strength, and
shield. We have nothing to fear when Love is at the [25]
helm of thought, but everything to enjoy on earth and
in heaven.

The systematized centres of Christian Science are life-
giving fountains of truth. Our churches, _The Christian_
_Science Journal_, and the _Christian Science Quarterly_, [30]
are prolific sources of spiritual power whose intellectual,
moral, and spiritual animus is felt throughout the land.

[Page 114.]

Our Publishing Society, and our Sunday Lessons, are [1]
of inestimable value to all seekers after Truth. The Com-
mittee on Sunday School Lessons cannot give too much
time and attention to their task, and should spare no
research in the preparation of the _Quarterly_ as an educa- [5]
tional branch.

The teachers of Christian Science need to watch inces-
santly the trend of their own thoughts; watch that these
be not secretly robbed, and themselves misguided, and
so made to misteach others. Teachers must conform [10]
strictly to the rules of divine Science announced in the
Bible and their textbook, "Science and Health with Key
to the Scriptures." They must themselves practise, and
teach others to practise, the Hebrew Decalogue, the Ser-
mon on the Mount, and the understanding and enuncia- [15]
tion of these according to Christ.

They must always have on armor, and resist the foe
within and without. They cannot arm too thoroughly
against original sin, appearing in its myriad forms: pass-
sion, appetites, hatred, revenge, and all the _et cetera_ of [20]
evil. Christian Scientists cannot watch too sedulously,
or bar their doors too closely, or pray to God too fer-
vently, for deliverance from the claims of evil. Thus
doing, Scientists will silence evil suggestions, uncover
their methods, and stop their hidden influence upon the [25]
lives of mortals. Rest assured that God in His wisdom
will test all mankind on all questions; and then, if found
faithful, He will deliver us from temptation and show us
the powerlessness of evil,--even its utter nothingness.

The teacher in Christian Science who does not spe- [30]
cially instruct his pupils how to guard against evil and
its silent modes, and to be able, through Christ, the liv-

[Page 115.]

ing Truth, to protect themselves therefrom, is commit- [1]
ting an offense against God and humanity. With Science
and Health for their textbook, I am astounded at the
apathy of some students on the subject of sin and mental
malpractice, and their culpable ignorance of the work- [5]
ing of these--and even the teacher's own deficiency in
this department. I can account for this state of mind in
the teacher only as the result of sin; otherwise, his own
guilt as a mental malpractitioner, and fear of being found
out. [10]

The helpless ignorance of the community on this sub-
ject is pitiable, and plain to be seen. May God enable
my students to take up the cross as I have done, and meet
the pressing need of a proper preparation of heart to prac-
tise, teach, and live Christian Science! Your means of [15]
protection and defense from sin are, constant watchful-
ness and prayer that you enter not into temptation and
are delivered from every claim of evil, till you intelligently
know and demonstrate, in Science, that evil has neither
prestige, power, nor existence, since God, good, is All- [20]
in-all.

The increasing necessity for relying on God to de-
fend us against the subtler forms of evil, turns us more
unreservedly to Him for help, and thus becomes a means
of grace. If one lives rightly, every effort to hurt one [25]
will only help that one; for God will give the ability to
overcome whatever tends to impede progress. Know
this: that you cannot overcome the baneful effects of
sin on yourself, if you in any way indulge in sin; for,
sooner or later, you will fall the victim of your own as [30]
well as of others' sins. Using mental power in the right
direction only, doing to others as you would have them

[Page 116.]

do to you, will overcome evil with good, and destroy [1]
your own sensitiveness to the power of evil.

The God of all grace be with you, and save you from
"spiritual wickedness in high places."

PLEASANT VIEW, CONCORD, N. H., [5]
June 3, 1895




Address Before The Christian Scientist Association Of The Massachusetts
Metaphysical College, In 1893


SUBJECT: _Obedience_ [10]

_My Beloved Students_:--This question, ever nearest
to my heart, is to-day uppermost: Are we filling the
measures of life's music aright, emphasizing its grand
strains, swelling the harmony of being with tones whence
come glad echoes? As _crescendo_ and _diminuendo_ accent [15]
music, so the varied strains of human chords express
life's loss or gain,--loss of the pleasures and pains and
pride of life: gain of its sweet concord, the courage of
honest convictions, and final obedience to spiritual law.
The ultimate of scientific research and attainment in [20]
divine Science is not an argument: it is not merely say-
ing, but doing, the Word--demonstrating Truth--even
as the fruits of watchfulness, prayer, struggles, tears, and
triumph.

Obeying the divine Principle which you profess to un- [25]
derstand and love, demonstrates Truth. Never absent
from your post, never off guard, never ill-humored, never
unready to work for God,--is obedience; being "faith-
ful over a few things." If in one instance obedience be
lacking, you lose the scientific rule and its reward: namely, [30]

[Page 117.]

to be made "ruler over many things." A progressive [1]
life is the reality of Life that unfolds its immortal Prin-
ciple.

The student of Christian Science must first separate the
tares from the wheat; discern between the thought, [5]
motive, and act superinduced by the wrong motive or
the true--the God-given intent and volition--arrest
the former, and obey the latter. This will place him on
the safe side of practice. We always know where to look
for the real Scientist, and always find him there. I agree [10]
with Rev. Dr. Talmage, that "there are wit, humor, and
enduring vivacity among God's people."

Obedience is the offspring of Love; and Love is the
Principle of unity, the basis of all right thinking and
acting; it fulfils the law. We see eye to eye and know as we [15]
are known, reciprocate kindness and work wisely, in
proportion as we love.

It is difficult for me to carry out a divine commission
while participating in the movements, or _modus operandi_,
of other folks. To point out every step to a student and [20]
then watch that each step be taken, consumes time,--
and experiments ofttimes are costly. According to my
calendar, God's time and mortals' differ. The neo-
phyte is inclined to be too fast or too slow: he works
somewhat in the dark; and, sometimes out of season, [25]
he would replenish his lamp at the midnight hour and
borrow oil of the more provident watcher. God is the
fountain of light, and He illumines one's way when one
is obedient. The disobedient make their moves before
God makes His, or make them too late to follow Him. [30]
Be sure that God _directs_ your way; then, hasten to follow
under every circumstance.

[Page 118.]

Human will must be subjugated. We cannot obey [1]
both God, good, and evil,--in other words, the ma-
terial senses, false suggestions, self-will, selfish motives,
and human policy. We shall have no faith in evil
when faith finds a resting-place and scientific under- [5]
standing guides man. Honesty in every condition,
under every circumstance, is the indispensable rule of
obedience. To obey the principle of mathematics ninety-
nine times in one hundred and then allow one numeral
to make incorrect your entire problem, is neither Science [10]
nor obedience.

However keenly the human affections yearn to for-
give a mistake, and pass a friend over it smoothly, one's
sympathy can neither atone for error, advance individual
growth, nor change this immutable decree of Love: "Keep [15]
My commandments." The guerdon of meritorious
faith or trustworthiness rests on being willing to work
alone with God and for Him,--willing to suffer patiently
for error until all error is destroyed and His rod and His
staff comfort you. [20]

Self-ignorance, self-will, self-righteousness, lust, covet-
ousness, envy, revenge, are foes to grace, peace, and
progress; they must be met manfully and overcome,
or they will uproot all happiness. Be of good cheer;
the warfare with one's self is grand; it gives one plenty [25]
of employment, and the divine Principle worketh with
you,--and obedience crowns persistent effort with
everlasting victory. Every attempt of evil to harm good
is futile, and ends in the fiery punishment of the
evil-doer. [30]

Jesus said, "Not that which goeth into the mouth
defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth,

[Page 119.]

this defileth a man." If malicious suggestions whisper [1]
evil through the mind's tympanum, this were no apology
for acting evilly. We are responsible for our thoughts and
acts; and instead of aiding other people's devices by
obeying them,--and then whining over misfortune,-- [5]
rise and overthrow both. If a criminal coax the unwary
man to commit a crime, our laws punish the dupe as ac-
cessory to the fact. Each individual is responsible for
himself.

Evil is impotent to turn the righteous man from his [10]
uprightness. The nature of the individual, more stub-
born than the circumstance, will always be found argu-
ing for itself,--its habits, tastes, and indulgences. This
material nature strives to tip the beam against the spir-
itual nature; for the flesh strives against Spirit,--against [15]
whatever or whoever opposes evil,--and weighs mightily
in the scale against man's high destiny. This conclusion
is not an argument either for pessimism or for optimism,
but is a plea for free moral agency,--full exemption
from all necessity to obey a power that should be and is [20]
found powerless in Christian Science.

Insubordination to the law of Love even in the least,
or strict obedience thereto, tests and discriminates be-
tween the real and the unreal Scientist. Justice, a
prominent statute in the divine law, demands of all [25]
trespassers upon the sparse individual rights which one
justly reserves to one's self,--Would you consent that
others should tear up your landmarks, manipulate your
students, nullify or reverse your rules, countermand
your orders, steal your possessions, and escape the [30]
penalty therefor? No! "Therefore all things what-
soever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even

[Page 120.]

so to them." The professors of Christian Science must [1]
take off their shoes at our altars; they must unclasp
the material sense of things at the very threshold of
Christian Science: they must obey implicitly each and
every injunction of the divine Principle of life's long [5]
problem, or repeat their work in tears. In the words
of St. Paul, "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield your-
selves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye
obey; whether of sin unto death, or of _obedience_ unto
righteousness?" [10]

Beloved students, loyal laborers are ye that have wrought
valiantly, and achieved great guerdons in the vineyard
of our Lord; but a mighty victory is yet to be won, a
great freedom for the race; and Christian success is
under arms,--with armor on, not laid down. Let us [15]
rejoice, however, that the clarion call of peace will at
length be heard above the din of battle, and come more
sweetly to our ear than sound of vintage bells to villagers
on the Rhine.

I recommend that this Association hereafter meet tri- [20]
ennially; many of its members reside a long distance from
Massachusetts, and they are members of The Mother
Church who would love to be with you on Sunday, and
once in three years is perhaps as often as they can afford
to be away from their own fields of labor. [25]




Communion Address, January, 1896


_Friends and Brethren:_--The Biblical record of the
great Nazarene, whose character we to-day commemorate,
is scanty; but what is given, puts to flight every doubt as
to the immortality of his words and works. Though [30]

[Page 121.]

written in a decaying language, his words can never pass [1]
away: they are inscribed upon the hearts of men: they
are engraved upon eternity's tablets.

Undoubtedly our Master partook of the Jews' feast
of the Passover, and drank from their festal wine-cup. [5]
This, however, is not the cup to which I call your at-
tention,--even the cup of martyrdom: wherein Spirit
and matter, good and evil, seem to grapple, and the
human struggles against the divine, up to a point of
discovery; namely, the impotence of evil, and the om- [10]
nipotence of good, as divinely attested. Anciently, the
blood of martyrs was believed to be the seed of the Church.
Stalled theocracy would make this fatal doctrine just
and sovereign, even a divine decree, a law of Love! That
the innocent shall suffer for the guilty, is inhuman. The [15]
prophet declared, "Thou shalt put away the guilt of
innocent blood from Israel." This is plain: that what-
ever belittles, befogs, or belies the nature and essence of
Deity, is not divine. Who, then, shall father or favor
this sentence passed upon innocence? thereby giving the [20]
signet of God to the arrest, trial, and crucifixion of His
beloved Son, the righteous Nazarene,--christened by
John the Baptist, "the Lamb of God."

Oh! shameless insult to divine royalty, that drew
