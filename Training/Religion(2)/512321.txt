It is seldom that a student, if healed in a class, has left it
understanding sufficiently the Science of healing to immediately
enter upon its practice. Why? Because the glad surprise of suddenly
regained health is a shock to the mind; and this holds and satisfies
the thought with exuberant joy.

This renders the mind less inquisitive, plastic, and tractable; and deep
systematic thinking is impracticable until this impulse subsides.

This was the principal reason for advising diseased people not to enter
a class. Few were taken besides invalids for students, until there were
enough practitioners to fill in the best possible manner the department
of healing. Teaching and healing should have separate departments, and
these should be fortified on all sides with suitable and thorough
guardianship and grace.

Only a very limited number of students can advantageously enter a class,
grapple with this subject, and well assimilate what has been taught them.
It is impossible to teach thorough Christian Science to promiscuous and
large assemblies, or to persons who cannot be addressed individually, so
that the mind of the pupil may be dissected more critically than the body
of a subject laid bare for anatomical examination. Public lectures cannot
be such lessons in Christian Science as are required to empty and to fill
anew the individual mind.

If publicity and material control are the motives for teaching, then
public lectures can take the place of private lessons; but the former
can never give a thorough knowledge of Christian Science, and a Christian
Scientist will never undertake to fit students for practice by such means.
Lectures in public are needed, but they must be subordinate to thorough
class instruction in any branch of education.

None with an imperfect sense of the spiritual signification of the Bible,
and its scientific relation to Mind-healing, should attempt overmuch in
their translation of the Scriptures into the "new tongue;" but I see that
some novices, in the truth of Science, and some impostors are committing
this error.


_Is there more than one school of scientific healing?_

In reality there is, and can be, but one school of the Science of
Mind-healing. Any departure from Science is an irreparable loss
of Science. Whatever is said and written correctly on this Science
originates from the Principle and practice laid down in Science and
Health, a work which I published in 1875. This was the first book,
recorded in history, which elucidates a pathological Science purely
mental.

Minor shades of difference in Mind-healing have originated with certain
opposing factions, springing up among unchristian students, who, fusing
with a class of aspirants which snatch at whatever is progressive, call
it their first-fruits, or else _post mortem_ evidence.

A slight divergence is fatal in Science. Like certain Jews whom St. Paul
had hoped to convert from mere motives of self-aggrandizement to the love
of Christ, these so-called schools are clogging the wheels of progress by
blinding the people to the true character of Christian Science,--its moral
power, and its divine efficacy to heal.

The true understanding of Christian Science Mind-healing never originated
in pride, rivalry, or the deification of self. The Discoverer of this
Science could tell you of timidity, of self-distrust, of friendlessness,
toil, agonies, and victories under which she needed miraculous vision to
sustain her, when taking the first footsteps in this Science.

The ways of Christianity have not changed. Meekness, selflessness, and
love are the paths of His testimony and the footsteps of His flock.
