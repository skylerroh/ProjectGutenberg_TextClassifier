    When starlight blends with morning's hue,
    I miss thee as the flower the dew!
    When noonday's length'ning shadows flee,
    I think of thee, I think of thee!

    With evening, memories reappear--
    I watch thy chair, and wish thee here;
    Till sleep sets drooping fancy free
    To dream of thee, to dream of thee!

    Since first we met, in weal or woe
    It hath been thus; and must be so
    Till bursting bonds our spirits part
    And Love divine doth fill my heart.

    Written many years ago.




_MOTHER'S EVENING PRAYER_


    O gentle presence, peace and joy and power;
      O Life divine, that owns each waiting hour,
    Thou Love that guards the nestling's faltering flight!
      Keep Thou my child on upward wing tonight.

    Love is our refuge; only with mine eye
      Can I behold the snare, the pit, the fall:
    His habitation high is here, and nigh,
      His arm encircles me, and mine, and all.

    O make me glad for every scalding tear,
      For hope deferred, ingratitude, disdain!
    Wait, and love more for every hate, and fear
      No ill,--since God is good, and loss is gain.

    Beneath the shadow of His mighty wing;
      In that sweet secret of the narrow way,
    Seeking and finding, with the angels sing:
      "Lo, I am with you alway,"--watch and pray.

    No snare, no fowler, pestilence or pain;
      No night drops down upon the troubled breast,
    When heaven's aftersmile earth's tear-drops gain,
      And mother finds her home and heav'nly rest.




_LOVE_


    Brood o'er us with Thy shelt'ring wing,
      'Neath which our spirits blend
    Like brother birds, that soar and sing,
      And on the same branch bend.
    The arrow that doth wound the dove
    Darts not from those who watch and love.

    If thou the bending reed wouldst break
      By thought or word unkind,
    Pray that his spirit you partake,
      Who loved and healed mankind:
    Seek holy thoughts and heavenly strain,
    That make men one in love remain.

    Learn, too, that wisdom's rod is given
      For faith to kiss, and know;
    That greetings glorious from high heaven,
      Whence joys supernal flow,
    Come from that Love, divinely near,
    Which chastens pride and earth-born fear,
    Through God, who gave that word of might
      Which swelled creation's lay:
    "Let there be light, and there was light."
      What chased the clouds away?
    'Twas Love whose finger traced aloud
    A bow of promise on the cloud.

    Thou to whose power our hope we give,
      Free us from human strife.
    Fed by Thy love divine we live,
      For Love alone is Life;
    And life most sweet, as heart to heart
    Speaks kindly when we meet and part.




_I'M SITTING ALONE_


    I'm sitting alone where the shadows fall
    In somber groups at the vesper-call,
    Where tear-dews of night seek the loving rose,
    Her bosom to fill with mortal woes.

    I'm waiting alone for the bridal hour
    Of nymph and naiad from woodland bower;
    Till vestal pearls that on leaflets lay,
    Ravished with beauty the eye of day.

    I'm watching alone o'er the starlit glow,
    O'er the silv'ry moon and ocean flow;
    And sketching in light the heaven of my youth--
    Its starry hopes and its waves of truth.

    I'm dreaming alone of its changeful sky--
    What rainbows of rapture floated by!
    Of a mother's love, that no words could speak
    When parting the ringlets to kiss my cheek.

    I'm thinking alone of a fair young bride,
    The light of a home of love and pride;
    How the glance of her husband's watchful eye
    Turned to his star of idolatry.

    I'm picturing alone a glad young face,
    Upturned to his mother's in playful grace;
    And the unsealed fountains of grief and joy
    That gushed at the birth of that beautiful boy.

    I'm weeping alone that the vision is fled,
    The leaves all faded, the fruitage shed,
    And wishing this earth more gifts from above,
    Our reason made right and hearts all love.

_THE UNITED STATES TO GREAT BRITAIN_


    Hail, brother! fling thy banner
      To the billows and the breeze;
    We proffer thee warm welcome
      With our hand, though not our knees.

    Lord of the main and manor!
      Thy palm, in ancient day,
    Didst rock the country's cradle
      That wakes thy laureate's lay.

    The hoar fight is forgotten;
      Our eagle, like the dove,
    Returns to bless a bridal
      Betokened from above.

    List, brother! angels whisper
      To Judah's sceptered race,--
    "Thou of the self-same spirit,
      Allied by nations' grace,

    "Wouldst cheer the hosts of heaven;
      For Anglo-Israel, lo!
    Is marching under orders;
      His hand averts the blow."

    Brave Britain, blest America!
      Unite your battle-plan;
    Victorious, all who live it,--
    The love for God and man.

_CHRIST MY REFUGE_


    O'er waiting harpstrings of the mind
      There sweeps a strain,
    Low, sad, and sweet, whose measures bind
      The power of pain,

    And wake a white-winged angel throng
      Of thoughts, illumed
    By faith, and breathed in raptured song,
      With love perfumed.

    Then His unveiled, sweet mercies show
      Life's burdens light.
    I kiss the cross, and wake to know
      A world more bright.

    And o'er earth's troubled, angry sea
      I see Christ walk,
    And come to me, and tenderly,
      Divinely talk.

    Thus Truth engrounds me on the rock,
      Upon Life's shore,
    'Gainst which the winds and waves can shock,
      Oh, nevermore!

    From tired joy and grief afar,
      And nearer Thee,--
    Father, where Thine own children are,
      I love to be.

    My prayer, some daily good to do
      To Thine, for Thee;
    An offering pure of Love, whereto
      God leadeth me.




"_FEED MY SHEEP_"


    Shepherd, show me how to go
      O'er the hillside steep,
    How to gather, how to sow,--
      How to feed Thy sheep;
    I will listen for Thy voice,
      Lest my footsteps stray;
    I will follow and rejoice
      All the rugged way.
