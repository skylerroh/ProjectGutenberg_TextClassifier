[Transcriber's Notes]
I fondly remember singing from the St. Gregory hymnal in grade school.
Looking down from the choir loft in the back of the church and standing
five feet from the shouting organ pipes that stretched from floor to
ceiling leaves a glorious impression on a ten year old!

My skill in Latin consists of two years in high school over fifty years
ago. I remember most of the pronunciation, but the precise meanings and
poetic meter is lost on me. I have carefully compared the printed text
with the transcription, but poetic structure may be incorrect.

My primary goal is to provide a source for singers and musicians who
love the old Latin hymns, as I do. I hope this will help spread the joy
provided by these "Oldies, but goodies."  All the text of the lyrics and
other material have been transcribed to this document for research and
indexing. If you can only remember a few words of a hymn, a simple
search should find the full text.

The Word and PDF version closely approximate the original page layout.

The HTML version provides the original images of the pages suitable for
printing and immediate use. Contrary to the usual Gutenberg guidelines,
the page numbers are left to provide easy reference to the original
pages.

The page images are stored as 1100 X 1600 GIF files to minimize file
size and preserve fidelity. On my computer a single sheet page fills an
8.5 by 11 inch sheet by setting the print scaling factor to 75%. A
scaling factor of 40% produces a page the size of the original book (4.3
X 6.0 inches). Some files are both facing pages because they are read
and sung using both pages. These print in the original size at 40%
scaling in either portrait or landscape format. "Your results may vary."

Where works span several pages, the text is rendered without interruption
and all the included pages are listed at the end of the work to provide
a search target.

The image files are named for easy access. N145_P226.gif is the first
page (226) of hymn number 145. N145_P227.gif is the second page (227)
of hymn number 145.
