      And joy with joy the truest;
    To Thee, O Christ, our praises soar,
    Who art our God for evermore.

    O Zion, lift thine eyes, behold
      The lights that shine around thee
    From east and west, and north and south,
      Thy children now surround thee;
    And in thy streets their praises soar,
    To Thee, O Christ, for evermore.

    Almighty Father! Word Divine!
      O spirit co-eternal!
    In persons three, in nature one,
      O God of power supernal!
    Baptized in Thee, our praises soar,
    And Thee we bless for evermore.

    And lead Thy people safely on
      E'en to their journey's end;
    Thy faithful people hear Thy voice,
    And in that steadfast hope rejoice.

    O Christ, our sacred Paschal feast,
      The Word, the might of God,--
    His wisdom most ineffable
      By Thee is shed abroad;
    O may we feast on Thee for aye
    In Thy blest realm of endless day.




                               _COLLECTS_
                 THE ECTENE AND THE LITANY OF THE DEACON


These Collects hold a most important place in the services of the Eastern
Church. There are few offices in which they are not found imbedded. Their
catholicity is most remarkable. The suffrages are peculiar to no church
service, but common to all liturgies. The people share in them by
responding 'Lord have mercy' at the end of each petition, and 'Amen' at
the close.

                                  HYMNS
                                  FROM
                          THE EARLY GREEK POETS
           NOT FOUND IN THE SERVICE-BOOKS OF THE GREEK CHURCH




                              ST. METHODIUS


Methodius, a prominent name in Ecclesiastical history, and a Father of
the Church, was born about the middle of the third century. He was first
of all Bishop of Olympus in Lycia, and, according to Jerome, became
ultimately Bishop of Tyre. He combated certain views of Origen, but would
seem to have been influenced not a little by the teaching of that great
theologian.

In his principal work, _The Banquet of the Ten Virgins_, the hymn is
found from which the following is a cento. It contains twenty-four
strophes, each beginning with a letter of the Greek alphabet in
alphabetical order, and ending with the same refrain.

Methodius is said to have suffered martyrdom under Diocletian about 311
A.D.

                                    I

    Behold the Bridegroom! Hark the cry,
    The dead, awaking, rends the sky!
        Go, virgins, He is near,
        Your lamps all burning clear;
    He enters where the rising light
    Asunder bursts the gates of night.
        In holy garb, with lamp aglow,
        To meet the Bridegroom forth I go.

                                   II

    The smiles of earth that turn to tears,
    Its empty joys and foolish fears
        I leave, for Thou dost call--
        Thou art my Life, my All;
    I would Thy beauty ever see,
    Then let me, Blessed, cling to Thee.
        In holy garb, with lamp aglow,
        To meet the Bridegroom forth I go.

                                   III

    For Thee I leave the world behind--
    Thou art my Bliss, O Bridegroom kind;
