      The evening shades appear;
    O, may we all remember well
      The night of death draws near!

2     We lay our garments by,
      Upon our beds to rest;
    So death shall soon disrobe us all
      Of what is here possessed.

3     Lord, keep us safe this night,
      Secure from all our fears;
    May angels guard us, while we sleep,
      Till morning light appears!

    Rest with thee in heaven at last.

    You hallelujahs sing on high;
    You joyful hymn the Ever-blest,
    Before the throne, and never rest.

3   I with your choir celestial join,
    In offering up a hymn divine;
    With you in heaven I hope to dwell,
    And bid the night and world farewell.

4   Blest Jesus, thou, on heaven intent,
    Whole nights hast in devotion spent;
    But I, frail creature, soon am tired,
    And all my zeal is soon expired.

5   Shine on me, Lord, new life impart,
    Fresh ardors kindle in my heart:
    One ray of thy all-quickening light
    Dispels the sloth and clouds of night.

      His watchful eye will keep;
    And, safe from violence and fear,
      Will fold his flock to sleep.

    Than earth's our spirits rouse,
    And call us, strengthened by his might,

    The sacred hours of holy rest.

2   Hushed is the tumult of this day,
      And worldly cares and business cease;
    While soft the vesper breezes play,
      To hymn the glad return of peace.
    O season blest! O moment given
    To turn the vagrant thoughts to heaven.

3   Oft as this hallowed hour shall come,
      O raise my thoughts from earthly things,
    And bear them to my heavenly home,
      On living faith's immortal wings--
    Till the last gleam of life decay,
    In one eternal Sabbath day.

2   And dear to me the winged hour,
      Spent in thy hallowed courts, O Lord!
    To feel devotion's soothing power,
      And catch the manna of thy word.

3   And dear to me the loud Amen,
      Which echoes through the blest abode,
    Which swells and sinks, and swells again,
      Dies on the walls, but lives to God.

4   Oft when the world, with iron hands,
      Has bound me in its six days' chain,
    This bursts them, like the strong man's bands,
      And lets my spirit loose again.

5   Go, man of pleasure, strike thy lyre,
      Of broken Sabbaths sing the charms;

      That bears us to a Father's arms.

1   There is a time when moments flow

      And all below, and all above,
    The various forms of Nature, wear
      One universal garb of love.

3   And then the peace that Jesus brought
      The life of grace eternal beams,
    And we, by his example taught,
      Improve the life his love redeems.

4   Delightful scene! a world at rest;
      A God all love; no grief, no fear;
    A heavenly hope, a peaceful breast,

Sabbath Hymn with Nature.


1   King of the world! I worship thee:
      Lord of the mind! the Sabbath's thine:--
    A contrite heart, a bended knee,
      To-day shall be my corn, my wine.
    A choral song for sacrifice
      Will mount as fire, and heavenward own
    The green-leaved earth, through joys and sighs
      A satellite round Mercy's throne.

2   The moon comes up to wake the dew,
      And hang a star on every leaf;
    The sun can take a rainbow hue,
      To kiss away the meadow's grief;
    The wave will lay its buoyance by,
      To let the cloud take anchor there;
    Earth, through her flowers, salutes the sky;
      The sky meets earth in balmy air.

3   And I was born to see and say
      How beauty beams, without, within:
    From the fly, made to gild a day,
      To my own soul, outliving sin.
    Even now I feel thy cherubim
      Have come to me from thee, All-wise!--
    Then, Silence, thou shalt be my hymn,
      And thought, my only sacrifice.

1   To Thee, my God! to thee I bring
    The evening's grateful offering;
    From thee, the source of joy above,
    Flow everlasting streams of love;
    And all the rays of light that shine,
    And bless creation, Lord! are thine.

    The noon, which all creation fills
    With glory; evening's placid fall,
    The twilight and the raven pall
    Of midnight; all alike proclaim
    Thy great, thine all impressive name.

3   And from the little worm, whose light
    Shines palely through the shades of night,
    Up to the sparkling stars that run
    Their evening rounds--or glorious sun,
    Rolling his car to twilight's rest--
    All, all in thee is bright and blest.

4   And over all--above, below,
    We see thee--ever-present thou!
    In every wandering rill that flows,
    In every gentle breeze that blows;
    In every rising, setting sun,
    We trace thee--own thee--holy One!

5   Yes! in the mid-day's fervid beams,
    And in the midnight's shadowy dreams,
    In action and repose, we see,
    We recognize and worship thee;
    To thee our worthiest songs would give,
    And in thee die, and to thee live.

1   Our Father, when beside the tomb

    Thy angels come amid the gloom,
      With solace for our doubt and woe.
    And looking through the shades of death
      To that bright land where none can die,
    How clearly then the eye of faith
      Beholds the portals of the sky!

2   And they whose lives serenely even
      In pleasure's flowery way have kept,
    Have never known the love of heaven,
      As they whose souls have mourned and wept!
    For stricken by the hand of woe,
      The soul must seek a Father's love,
    And they who weep can only know
      What healing balm is found above!

3   And one repentant hour of tears,
      Of sweet communion and of prayer,
    Is worth a thousand, thousand years
      Where pleasure's thoughtless children are!
    And O, if ever man below
      Draws nearer to the eternal throne,
    'Tis when his soul, subdued by woe,
      Seeks refuge with its God above!

2   Loosed from the ark, a heavenly dove,
      The promise-branch of olive bore,--
    Pledge of returning peace and love
      That beamed more brightly than before:--

3   So when affliction's waters glide
      From the enfranchised soul away,
    More peaceful, pure, and sanctified,
      The soul emerges into day.

4   And then, as with the olive bough
      The heavenly dove of old drew near,
    Some gentle words of truth will flow,
      In holy music on the ear.

5   O'er all the transient things of time,
      The oblivious foot of years hath trod;
    But all that's sacred and sublime
      Stands steadfast as the truth of God.

      Thy long-loved olive tree,
    And Salem's shrines were lighted
      For other gods than thee.

3   Then sunk the star of Solyma,
      Then passed her glory's day,
    Like heath that in the wilderness
      The wild wind whirls away.
    Silent and waste her bowers,
      Where once the mighty trod;
    And sunk those guilty towers,
      Where Baal reigned as God.

Remonstrance with the Jews.


1   Why on the bending willows hung,
      Israel! still sleeps thy tuneful string?--
    Still mute remains thy sullen tongue,
      And Zion's song denies to sing?

2   Awake! thy sweetest raptures raise;
      Let harp and voice unite their strains
    Thy promised King his sceptre sways;
      Jesus, thine own Messiah, reigns!

3   No taunting foes the song require:
      No strangers mock thy captive chain:
    But friends provoke the silent lyre,
      And brethren ask the holy strain.

4   Nor fear thy Salem's hills to wrong,
      If other lands thy triumph share:
    A heavenly city claims thy song;
      A brighter Salem rises there.

5   By foreign streams no longer roam;
      Nor, weeping, think of Jordan's flood:
    In every clime behold a home,
      In every temple see thy God.

The Glory of the Redeemed.


1   Hear what God the Lord hath spoken,
      "O my people, faint and few,
    Comfortless, afflicted, broken,
      Fair abodes I build for you;
    Thorns of heart-felt tribulation
      Shall no more perplex your ways;
    Ye shall name your walls, Salvation,
      And your gates shall all be praise.

2   "There, like streams that feed the garden,
      Pleasures without end shall flow;
    For the Lord, your faith rewarding,
      All his bounty shall bestow;
    Still, in undisturbed possession,
      Peace and righteousness shall reign:
    Never shall you feel oppression,
      Hear the voice of war again.

3   "Ye no more your suns descending,
      Waning moons no more shall see;
    But, your griefs forever ending,
      Find eternal noon in me;
    God shall rise, and shining o'er you,
      Change to day the gloom of night;
    He, the Lord, shall be your glory,
      God, your everlasting light."

The Noble Army of Martyrs.


1   The triumphs of the martyred saints
      The joyous lay demand;
    The heart delights in song to dwell
      On that victorious band--
    Those whom the senseless world abhorred,
      Who cast the world aside,
    Deeming it worthless, for the sake
      Of Christ, their Lord and Guide.

2   For him they braved the tyrant's rage,
      The scourge's cruel smart;
    The wild beast's fang their bodies tore,
      But vanquished not the heart;
    Like lambs before the sword they fell,
      Nor cry nor plaint expressed;
    For patience kept the conscious mind
      And armed the fearless breast.

3   What tongue can tell the crown prepared
      The martyr's brow to grace?
    His shining robe, his joys unknown,
      Before thy glorious face?
    Vouchsafe us, Lord, if such thy will.
      Clear skies and seasons calm;
    If not, the martyr's cross to bear,
      And win the martyr's palm.

The Death of Martyrs.


1   Flung to the heedless winds,
      Or on the waters cast,
    Their ashes shall be watched,
      And gathered at the last:
    And from that scattered dust,
      Around us and abroad,
    Shall spring a plenteous seed
      Of witnesses for God.

2   The Father hath received
      Their latest living breath;
    Yet vain is Satan's boast
      Of victory in their death:
    Still, still, though dead, they speak,
      And trumpet-tongued proclaim
    To many a wakening land
      The one availing name.

Thanks for all Saints.


1     For all thy saints, O God,
      Who strove in Christ to live,
    Who followed him, obeyed, adored,
      Our grateful hymn receive.

2     For all thy saints, O God,
      Accept our thankful cry,
    Who counted Christ their great reward,
      And strove in him to die.

3     They all, in life and death,
      With him, their Lord in view,
    Learned from thy Holy Spirit's breath
      To suffer and to do.

4     For this thy name we bless,
      And humbly beg that we
    May follow them in holiness,
      And live and die in thee.

Quiet Religion.


1   Open, Lord, my inward ear,
      And bid my heart rejoice;
    Bid my quiet spirit hear
      The comfort of thy voice;
    Never in the whirlwind found,
      Or where earthquakes rock the place
    Still and silent is the sound,
      The whisper of thy grace.

2   From the world of sin, and noise,
      And hurry, I withdraw;
    For the small and inward voice
      I wait with humble awe;
    Silent I am now and still,
      Dare not in thy presence move;
    To my waiting soul reveal
      The secret of thy love.

"A Hiding-place from the Wind," &c.


1   When dread misfortune's tempests rise,
    And roar through all the darkened skies,
    Where shall the anxious pilgrim gain
    A shelter from the wind and rain?
    Within the covert of thy grace,
    O Lord, there is a hiding-place,
    Where, unconcerned, we hear the sound,
    Though storm and tempest rage around.

2   When, wandering o'er the desert bare
    Of burning sands and sultry air,
    We've sought the cheerless region through,
    But found no stream to meet our view,--
    'Tis then, the rivers of thy love,
    Descending from thy throne above,
    Supply our wants, and soothe our pain,
    And raise our fainting souls again.

3   When in a weary land we tire,
    And our exhausted powers expire,
    With toil, and care, and heat oppressed,
    Where shall our languid spirits rest?
    O, who could bear the blasting ray,
    And all the burden of the day,
    Did not a Rock in Zion stand,
    O'ershading all this weary land!

On Opening an Organ.


1   All nature's works his praise declare
      To whom they all belong;
    There is a voice in every star,
      In every breeze a song.
    Sweet music fills the world abroad
      With strains of love and power;
    The stormy sea sings praise to God--
      The thunder and the shower.

2   To God the tribes of ocean cry,
      And birds upon the wing;
    To God, the powers that dwell on high
      Their tuneful tribute bring.
    Like them let man the throne surround,
      With them loud chorus raise,
    While instruments of loftiest sound
      Assist his feeble praise.

3   Great God! to thee we consecrate
      Our voices and our skill;
    We bid the pealing organ wait
      To speak alone thy will.
    Oh, teach its rich and swelling notes
      To lift our souls on high;
    And while the music round us floats,
      Let earth-born passion die.
