    Men with erring sinners found Thee,
      Found the only sinless One;
    And upon a Cross they bound Thee,
      For the good that Thou hadst done;
          Come, upon the Cross adore Him,
          Let us now fall down before Him.

                                   III

    We have heard the wondrous story
      Of the Resurrection day,--
    Christ our God, to Him be glory,
      For He casts death's bands away.
          Let us worship and adore Him,
          Come and let us fall before Him.

                                   IV

    Come, ye faithful, come with gladness,
      To your God thanksgiving pay;
    For the Cross was shorn of sadness
      On the Resurrection day.
          Let us worship and adore Him,
          Come and let us bow before Him.

    When, O King Immortal,
      Thou didst seek the gloom,
    Tasting death in meekness,
      Resting in the tomb--
    On that dark and woful day,
    Hades owned Thy kingly sway.

                                   II

    Victor! now we hail Thee,
      Hail Thee Christ our God;
    Thou hast burst the barrier
      Of Thy dark abode;
    On that glad and glorious day,
    Hades owned Thy kingly sway.

    They who bore the spices
      In the early hour,
    Heard the salutation
      Of the Lord of power,
    And His followers, sore and sad,
    Found the peace that made them glad.

                                   IV

    Hail the King Immortal!
      Death by death is slain,
    And the weak and fallen
      Rise to life again;
    On this glad and glorious day
    Hades owns the Victor's sway.

    Behold the Bridegroom cometh
      At the hour of midnight drear,
    And blest be he who watcheth
      When his Master shall appear,
    But woe betide the careless one
      Asleep when He is near!

                                   II

    O soul of mine, bestir thee
      Lest thou sink in slumber quite,
    And the Bridegroom find thee sleeping
      When He cometh in His might.
    Awake, awake to praises,
      For He cometh in the night.

                                   III

    That fearful day approacheth,
      Then live, O soul, aright,
    And watch the hour, and trim thy lamp
      And keep it burning bright,
    Lest the voice be heard, 'He cometh!'
      In the middle of the night.

                                   IV

    Beware when slumber binds thee,
      Lest the Bridegroom pass thee by,
    And thou knock without in darkness,
      And for grief and anguish cry;
    Take thy lamp, with oil, and trim it,
      For the hour is drawing nigh.

    O Jesus, Lover of our race,
    How rich the promise of Thy grace
      To Thy disciples made,--
    A holy Paraclete to send,
    To succour, comfort, and befriend
      With His inspiring aid.

    On earth the light is shining clear,
    The Holy Comforter is here,
      To all the faithful given;
    And now, what prophets long foretold,
    In all His fulness we behold
      The Spirit sent from heaven.

    O Jesus, to Thy servants give
      The consolation they require;
    And when the cloud of trouble falls,
      With heavenly hope their souls inspire.
    Be ever near us, Christ, to bless
    And help us in Thy faithfulness.

                                   II

    As Thou wert with Thy saints of old,
      Be with us, ever present, Lord;
    Unite us to Thyself, we pray,
      As Thou hast promised by Thy word;
    Then we shall glorify and laud
    The Holy Spirit sent by God.

      O Christ, to Thee we pray,
    For Thou didst break the bands of death
      When dawned the glorious day.

      Of Thy celestial fire.
