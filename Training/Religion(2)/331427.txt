sary in the one case as in the other. The scientific Prin- [1]
ciple of healing demands such cooperation; but this
unison and its power would be arrested if one were to
mix material methods with the spiritual,--were to min-
gle hygienic rules, drugs, and prayers in the same pro- [5]
cess,--and thus serve "other gods." Truth is as
effectual in destroying sickness as in the destruction
of sin.

It is often asked, "If Christian Science is the same
method of healing that Jesus and the apostles used, [10]
why do not its students perform as instantaneous cures
as did those in the first century of the Christian era?"

In some instances the students of Christian Science
equal the ancient prophets as healers. All true healing
is governed by, and demonstrated on, the same Princi- [15]
ple as theirs; namely, the action of the divine Spirit,
through the power of Truth to destroy error, discord
of whatever sort. The reason that the same results fol-
low not in every ease, is that the student does not in
every case possess sufficiently the Christ-spirit and its [20]
power to cast out the disease. The Founder of Chris-
tian Science teaches her students that they must possess
the spirit of Truth and Love, must gain the power
over sin in themselves, or they cannot be instantaneous
healers. [25]

In this Christian warfare the student or practitioner
has to master those elements of evil too common to other
minds. If it is hate that is holding the purpose to kill
his patient by mental means, it requires more divine
understanding to conquer this sin than to nullify either [30]
the disease itself or the ignorance by which one unin-
tentionally harms himself or another. An element of

[Page 41.]

brute-force that only the cruel and evil can send forth, is [1]
given vent in the diabolical practice of one who, having
learned the power of liberated thought to do good, per-
verts it, and uses it to accomplish an evil purpose. This
mental malpractice would disgrace Mind-healing, were it [5]
not that God overrules it, and causes "the wrath of man"
to praise Him. It deprives those who practise it of the
power to heal, and destroys their own possibility of
progressing.

The honest student of Christian Science is purged [10]
through Christ, Truth, and thus is ready for victory in
the ennobling strife. The good fight must be fought by
those who keep the faith and finish their course. Mental
purgation must go on: it promotes spiritual growth,
scales the mountain of human endeavor, and gains the [15]
summit in Science that otherwise could not be reached,
--where the struggle with sin is forever done.

_Can all classes of disease be healed by your method?_

We answer, Yes. Mind is the architect that builds
its own idea, and produces all harmony that appears. [20]
There is no other healer in the case. If mortal mind,
through the action of fear, manifests inflammation and a
belief of chronic or acute disease, by removing the cause
in that so-called mind the effect or disease will disappear
and health will be restored; for health, _alias_ harmony, [25]
is the normal manifestation of man in Science. The
divine Principle which governs the universe, including
man, if demonstrated, is sufficient for all emergencies.
But the practitioner may not always prove equal to
bringing out the result of the Principle that he knows to [30]
be true.

[Page 42.]

_After the change called death takes place, do we meet_ [1]
_those gone before?--or does life continue in thought only_
_as in a dream?_

Man is not annihilated, nor does he lose his identity,
by passing through the belief called death. After the [5]
momentary belief of dying passes from mortal mind, this
mind is still in a conscious state of existence; and the in-
dividual has but passed through a moment of extreme
mortal fear, to awaken with thoughts, and being, as
material as before. Science and Health clearly states [10]
that spiritualization of thought is not attained by the death
of the body, but by a conscious union with God. When
we shall have passed the ordeal called death, or destroyed
this last enemy, and shall have come upon the same plane
of conscious existence with those gone before, then we [15]
shall be able to communicate with and to recognize them.

If, before the change whereby we meet the dear de-
parted, our life-work proves to have been well done, we
shall not have to repeat it; but our joys and means of ad-
vancing will be proportionately increased. [20]

The difference between a belief of material existence
and the spiritual fact of Life is, that the former is a dream
and unreal, while the latter is real and eternal. Only
as we understand God, and learn that good, not evil,
lives and is immortal, that immortality exists only in [25]
spiritual perfection, shall we drop our false sense of Life
in sin or sense material, and recognize a better state of
existence.

_Can I be treated without being present during treatment?_

Mind is not confined to limits; and nothing but our [30]
own false admissions prevent us from demonstrating this

[Page 43.]

great fact. Christian Science, recognizing the capabili- [1]
ties of Mind to act of itself, and independent of matter,
enables one to heal cases without even having seen the
individual,--or simply after having been made ac-
quainted with the mental condition of the patient. [5]

_Do all who at present claim to be teaching Christian_
_Science, teach it correctly?_

By no means: Christian Science is not sufficiently un-
derstood for that. The student of this Science who under-
stands it best, is the one least likely to pour into other [10]
minds a trifling sense of it as being adequate to make safe
and successful practitioners. The simple sense one gains
of this Science through careful, unbiased, contemplative
reading of my books, is far more advantageous to the
sick and to the learner than is or can be the spurious [15]
teaching of those who are spiritually unqualified. The
sad fact at this early writing is, that the letter is gained
sooner than the spirit of Christian Science: time is re-
quired thoroughly to qualify students for the great ordeal
of this century. [20]

If one student tries to undermine another, such sinister
rivalry does a vast amount of injury to the Cause. To
fill one's pocket at the expense of his conscience, or to
build on the downfall of others, incapacitates one to
practise or teach Christian Science. The occasional tem- [25]
porary success of such an one is owing, in part, to the im-
possibility for those unacquainted with the mighty Truth
of _Christian_ Science to recognize, as such, the barefaced
errors that are taught--and the damaging effects these
leave on the practice of the learner, on the Cause, and [30]
on the health of the community.

[Page 44.]

Honest students speak the truth "according to the [1]
pattern showed to thee in the mount," and live it: these
are not working for emoluments, and may profitably
teach people, who are ready to investigate this subject,
the rudiments of Christian Science. [5]

_Can Christian Science cure acute cases where there is_
_necessity for immediate relief, as in membranous croup?_

The remedial power of Christian Science is positive,
and its application direct. It cannot fail to heal in
every case of disease, when conducted by one who un- [10]
derstands this Science sufficiently to demonstrate its
highest possibilities.

_If I have the toothache, and nothing stops it until I_
_have the tooth extracted, and then the pain ceases, has_
_the mind, or extracting, or both, caused the pain to_ [15]
_cease?_

What you thought was pain in the bone or nerve, could
only have been a belief of pain in matter; for matter
has no sensation. It was a state of mortal thought made
manifest in the flesh. You call this body matter, when [20]
awake, or when asleep in a dream. That matter can re-
report pain, or that mind is _in_ matter, reporting sensa-
tions, is but a dream at all times. You believed that if
the tooth were extracted, the pain would cease: this de-
mand of mortal thought once met, your belief assumed [25]
a new form, and said, There is no more pain. When
your belief in pain ceases, the pain stops; for matter
has no intelligence of its own. By applying this men-
tal remedy or antidote directly to your belief, you scien-

[Page 45.]

tifically prove the fact that Mind is supreme. This is not [1]
done by will-power, for that is not Science but mesmerism.
The full understanding that God is Mind, and that mat-
ter is but a belief, enables you to control pain. Chris-
tian Science, by means of its Principle of metaphysical [5]
healing, is able to do more than to heal a toothache;
although its power to allay fear, prevent inflammation,
and destroy the necessity for ether--thereby avoiding
the fatal results that frequently follow the use of that
drug--render this Science invaluable in the practice [10]
of dentistry.

_Can an atheist or a profane man be cured by metaphysics,_
_or Christian Science?_

The moral status of the man demands the remedy of
Truth more in this than in most cases; therefore, under [15]
the deific law that supply invariably meets demand, this
Science is effectual in treating moral ailments. Sin is
not the master of divine Science, but _vice versa_; and
when Science in a single instance decides the conflict,
the patient is better both morally and physically. [20]

_If God made all that was made, and it was good, where_
_did evil originate?_

It never originated or existed as an entity. It is but a
false belief; even the belief that God is not what the
Scriptures imply Him to be, All-in-all, but that there [25]
is an opposite intelligence or mind termed evil. This
error of belief is idolatry, having "other gods before me."
In John i. 3 we read, "All things were made by Him;
and without Him was not anything made that was made."

[Page 46.]

The admission of the reality of evil perpetuates the belief [1]
or faith in evil. The Scriptures declare, "To whom ye
yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are."
The leading self-evident proposition of Christian Science
is: good being real, evil, good's opposite, is unreal. This [5]
truism needs only to be tested scientifically to be found
true, and adapted to destroy the appearance of evil to an
extent beyond the power of any doctrine previously
entertained.

_Do you teach that you are equal with God?_ [10]

A reader of my writings would not present this ques-
tion. There are no such indications in the premises or
conclusions of Christian Science, and such a misconcep-
tion of Truth is not scientific. Man is not equal with
his Maker; that which is formed is not cause, but effect, [15]
and has no power underived from its creator. It is pos-
sible, and it is man's duty, so to throw the weight of his
thoughts and acts on the side of Truth, that he be ever
found in the scale _with_ his creator; not weighing
equally with Him, but comprehending at every point, in [20]
divine Science, the full significance of what the apostle
meant by the declaration, "The Spirit itself beareth wit-
ness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and
if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
Christ." In Science, man represents his divine Prin- [25]
ciple,--the Life and Love that are God,--even as the
idea of sound, in tones, represents harmony; but thought
has not yet wholly attained unto the Science of being,
wherein man is perfect even as the Father, his divine
Principle, is perfect. [30]

[Page 47.]

_How can I believe that there is no such thing as matter,_ [1]
_when I weigh over two hundred pounds and carry about_
_this weight daily?_

By learning that matter is but manifest mortal mind.
You entertain an adipose belief of yourself as substance; [5]
whereas, substance means more than matter: it is the
glory and permanence of Spirit: it is that which is
hoped for but unseen, that which the material senses
cannot take in. Have you never been so preoccupied in
thought when moving your body, that you did this with- [10]
out consciousness of its weight? If never in your waking
hours, you have been in your night-dreams; and these
tend to elucidate your day-dream, or the mythical nature
of matter, and the possibilities of mind when let loose
from its own beliefs. In sleep, a sense of the body ac- [15]
companies thought with less impediment than when
awake, which is the truer sense of being. In Science,
body is the servant of Mind, not its master: Mind is
supreme. Science reverses the evidence of material
sense with the spiritual sense that God, Spirit, is the only [20]
substance; and that man, His image and likeness, is
spiritual, not material. This great Truth does not de-
stroy but substantiates man's identity,--together with
his immortality and preexistence, or his spiritual co-
existence with his Maker. That which has a beginning [25]
must have an ending.

_What should one conclude as to Professor Carpenter's_
_exhibitions of mesmerism?_

That largely depends upon what one accepts as either
useful or true. I have no knowledge of mesmerism, [30]

[Page 48.]

practically or theoretically, save as I measure its demon- [1]
strations as a false belief, and avoid all that works ill. If
mesmerism has the power attributed to it by the gentle-
man referred to, it should neither be taught nor practised,
but should be conscientiously condemned. One thing [5]
is quite apparent; namely, that its so-called power is
despotic, and Mr. Carpenter deserves praise for his public
exposure of it. If such be its power, I am opposed to it,
as to every form of error,--whether of ignorance or
fanaticism, prompted by money-making or malice. It [10]
is enough for me to know that animal magnetism is neither
of God nor Science.

It is alleged that at one of his recent lectures in Bos-
ton Mr. Carpenter made a man drunk on water, and
then informed his audience that he could produce the [15]
effect of alcohol, or of any drug, on the human system,
through the action of mind alone. This honest declara-
tion as to the animus of animal magnetism and the pos-
sible purpose to which it can be devoted, has, we trust,
been made in season to open the eyes of the people to the [20]
hidden nature of some tragic events and sudden deaths
at this period.

_Was ever a person made insane by studying meta-_
_physics?_

Such an occurrence would be impossible, for the [25]
proper study of Mind-healing would cure the insane.
That persons have gone away from the Massachusetts
Metaphysical College "made insane by Mrs. Eddy's
teachings," like a hundred other stories, is a baseless
fabrication offered solely to injure her or her school. [30]
The enemy is trying to make capital out of the follow-

[Page 49.]

ing case. A young lady entered the College class who, [1]
I quickly saw, had a tendency to monomania, and re-
quested her to withdraw before its close. We are cred-
ibly informed that, before entering the College, this
young lady had manifested some mental unsoundness, [5]
and have no doubt she could have been restored by
Christian Science treatment. Her friends employed a
homoeopathist, who had the skill and honor to state, as his
opinion given to her friends, that "Mrs. Eddy's teach-
ings had not produced insanity." This is the only case [10]
that could be distorted into the claim of insanity ever
having occurred in a class of Mrs. Eddy's; while ac-
knowledged and notable cases of insanity have been
cured in her class.

_If all that is mortal is a dream or error, is not_ [15]
_our capacity for formulating a dream, real; is it not_
_God-made; and if God-made, can it be wrong, sinful, or_
_an error?_

The spirit of Truth leads into all truth, and enables
man to discern between the real and the unreal. Enter- [20]
taining the common belief in the opposite of goodness,
and that evil is as real as good, opposes the leadings of
the divine Spirit that are helping man Godward: it pre-
vents a recognition of the nothingness of the dream, or
belief, that Mind is in matter, intelligence in non-intel- [25]
ligence, sin, and death. This belief presupposes not
only a power opposed to God, and that God is not All-
in-all, as the Scriptures imply Him to be, but that the
capacity to err proceeds from God.

That God is Truth, the Scriptures aver; that Truth [30]
never created error, or such a capacity, is self-evident;

[Page 50.]

that God made all that was made, is again Scriptural; [1]
therefore your answer is, that error is an illusion of
mortals; that God is not its author, and it cannot be
real.

_Does __"__Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures__"_ [5]
_explain the entire method of metaphysical healing, or is_
_there a secret back of what is contained in that book, as_
_some say?_

"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures"
is a complete textbook of Christian Science; and its [10]
metaphysical method of healing is as lucid in presenta-
tion as can be possible, under the necessity to express
the metaphysical in physical terms. There is absolutely
no additional secret outside of its teachings, or that gives
one the power to heal; but it is essential that the student [15]
gain the spiritual understanding of the contents of this
book, in order to heal.

_Do you believe in change of heart?_

We do believe, and understand--which is more--
that there must be a change from human affections, de- [20]
sires, and aims, to the divine standard, "Be ye therefore
perfect;" also, that there must be a change from the be-
lief that the heart is matter and sustains life, to the
understanding that God is our Life, that we exist in
Mind, live thereby, and have being. This change of [25]
heart would deliver man from heart-disease, and ad-
vance Christianity a hundredfold. The human affections
need to be changed from self to benevolence and love
for God and man; changed to having but _one_ God and
loving Him supremely, and helping our brother man. [30]

[Page 51.]

This change of heart is essential to Christianity, and [1]
will have its effect physically as well as spiritually,
healing disease. Burnt offerings and drugs, God does
not require.

_Is a belief of nervousness, accompanied by great mental_ [5]
_depression, mesmerism?_

All mesmerism is of one of three kinds; namely, the
ignorant, the fraudulent, or the malicious workings of
error or mortal mind. We have not the particulars of
the case to which you may refer, and for this reason can- [10]
not answer your question professionally.

_How can I govern a child metaphysically? Doesn't the_
_use of the rod teach him life in matter?_

The use of the rod is virtually a declaration to the
child's mind that sensation belongs to matter. Motives [15]
govern acts, and Mind governs man. If you make clear
to the child's thought the right motives for action, and
cause him to love them, they will lead him aright: if you
educate him to love God, good, and obey the Golden
Rule, he will love and obey you without your having to [20]
resort to corporeal punishment.


    ""When from the lips of Truth one mighty breath
    Shall, like a whirlwind, scatter in its breeze
    The whole dark pile of human mockeries;
    Then shall the reign of Mind commence on earth, [25]
    And starting fresh, as from a second birth,
    Man in the sunshine of the world's new spring,
    Shall walk transparent like some holy thing."


_Are both prayer and drugs necessary to heal?_

The apostle James said, "Ye ask, and receive not, [30]
because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your

[Page 52.]

lusts." This text may refer to such as seek the material [1]
to aid the spiritual, and take drugs to support God's
power to heal them. It is difficult to say how much
one can do for himself, whose faith is divided be-
tween catnip and Christ; but not so difficult to know [5]
that if he were to serve one master, he could do vastly
more. Whosoever understands the power of Spirit, has
no doubt of God's power,--even the might of Truth,--
to heal, through divine Science, beyond all human means
and methods. [10]

_What do you think of marriage?_

That it is often convenient, sometimes pleasant, and
occasionally a love affair. Marriage is susceptible of
many definitions. It sometimes presents the most
wretched condition of human existence. To be normal, [15]
it must be a union of the affections that tends to lift
mortals higher.

_If this life is a dream not dispelled, but only changed,_
_by death,--if one gets tired of it, why not commit_
_suicide?_ [20]

Man's existence is a problem to be wrought in divine
Science. What progress would a student of science
make, if, when tired of mathematics or failing to dem-
onstrate one rule readily, he should attempt to work
out a rule farther on and more difficult--and this, [25]
because the first rule was not easily demonstrated? In
that case he would be obliged to turn back and work
out the previous example, before solving the advanced
problem. Mortals have the sum of being to work out,
and up, to its spiritual standpoint. They must work [30]

[Page 53.]

out of this dream or false claim of sensation and life [1]
in matter, and up to the spiritual realities of existence,
before this false claim can be wholly dispelled. Com-
mitting suicide to dodge the question is not working
it out. The error of supposed life and intelligence in [5]
matter, is dissolved only as we master error with Truth.
Not through sin or suicide, but by _overcoming_ tempta-
tion and sin, shall we escape the weariness and wicked-
ness of mortal existence, and gain heaven, the harmony
of being. [10]

_Do you sometimes find it advisable to use medicine to_
_assist in producing a cure, when it is difficult to start the_
_patient's recovery?_

You only weaken your power to heal through Mind,
by any compromise with matter; which is virtually ac- [15]
knowledging that under difficulties the former is not equal
to the latter. He that resorts to physics, seeks what is
below instead of above the standard of metaphysics;
showing his ignorance of the meaning of the term and
of Christian Science. [20]

_If Christian Science is the same as Jesus taught, why is_
_it not more simple, so that all can readily understand it?_

The teachings of Jesus were simple; and yet he found
it difficult to make the rulers understand, because of
their great lack of spirituality. Christian Science is [25]
simple, and readily understood by the children; only
the thought educated away from it finds it abstract or
difficult to perceive. Its seeming abstraction is the
mystery of godliness; and godliness is simple to the
godly; but to the unspiritual, the ungodly, it is dark [30]

[Page 54.]

and difficult. The carnal mind cannot discern spiritual [1]
things.

_Has Mrs. Eddy lost her power to heal?_

Has the sun forgotten to shine, and the planets to
revolve around it? Who is it that discovered, dem- [5]
onstrated, and teaches Christian Science? That one,
whoever it be, does understand something of what can-
not be lost. Thousands in the field of metaphysical
healing, whose lives are worthy testimonials, are her
students, and they bear witness to this fact. Instead [10]
of losing her power to heal, she is demonstrating the
power of Christian Science over all obstacles that envy
and malice would fling in her path. The reading of her
book, "Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,"
is curing hundreds at this very time; and the sick, un- [15]
asked, are testifying thereto.

_Must I study your Science in order to keep well all my_
_life? I was healed of a chronic trouble after one month's_
_treatment by one of your students._

When once you are healed by Science, there is no rea- [20]
son why you should be liable to a return of the disease
that you were healed of. But not to be subject again to
any disease whatsoever, would require an understanding
of the Science by which you were healed.

_Because none of your students haw been able to perform_ [25]
_as great miracles in healing as Jesus and his disciples did,_
_does it not suggest the possibility that they do not heal on_
_the same basis?_

You would not ask the pupil in simple equations to
solve a problem involving logarithms; and then, because [30]

[Page 55.]

he failed to get the right answer, condemn the pupil [1]
and the science of numbers. The simplest problem
in Christian Science is healing the sick, and the least
understanding and demonstration thereof prove all its
possibilities. The ability to demonstrate to the extent [5]
that Jesus did, will come when the student possesses as
much of the divine Spirit as he shared, and utilizes its
power to overcome sin.

Opposite to good, is the universal claim of evil that
seeks the proportions of good. There may be those [10]
who, having learned the power of the unspoken thought,
use it to harm rather than to heal, and who are using
that power against Christian Scientists. This giant sin
is the sin against the Holy Ghost spoken of in Matt.
xii. 31, 32. [15]

_Is Christian Science based on the facts of both Spirit_
_and matter?_

Christian Science is based on the facts of Spirit and
its forms and representations, but these facts are the
direct antipodes of the so-called facts of matter; and [20]
the eternal verities of Spirit assert themselves over their
opposite, or matter, in the final destruction of all that
is unlike Spirit.

Man knows that he can have one God only, when
he regards God as the only Mind, Life, and substance. [25]
If God is Spirit, as the Scriptures declare, and All-in-
all, matter is mythology, and its laws are mortal
beliefs.

If Mind is in matter and beneath a skull bone, it is
in something unlike Him; hence it is either a godless and [30]
material Mind, or it is God in matter,--which are theo-

[Page 56.]

ries of agnosticism and pantheism, the very antipodes [1]
of Christian Science

_What is organic life?_

Life is inorganic, infinite Spirit; if Life, or Spirit,
were organic, disorganization would destroy Spirit and [5]
annihilate man.

If Mind is not substance, form, and tangibility, God
is substanceless; for the substance of Spirit is divine
Mind. Life is God, the only creator, and Life is im-
mortal Mind, not matter. [10]

Every indication of matter's constituting life is mortal,
the direct opposite of immortal Life, and infringes the
rights of Spirit. Then, to conclude that Spirit consti-
