           The following account is taken from the Polynesian Researches
           of the Rev. William Ellis, the well-known English missionary,
           who visited these islands in the years 1822 and 1823, and
           whose recorded observations have been of the highest value in
           preserving a knowledge of the institutions of ancient Hawaii.

           In the afternoon, a party of strolling musicians and dancers
           arrived at Kairua. About four o'clock they came, followed by
           crowds of people, and arranged themselves on a fine sandy
           beach in front of one of the governor's houses, where they
           exhibited a native dance, called _hura araapapa_.

           The five musicians first seated themselves in a line on the
           ground, and spread a piece of folded cloth on the sand before
           them. Their instrument was a large calabash, or rather two,
           one of an oval shape about three feet high, the other
           perfectly round, very neatly fastened to it, having also an
           aperture about three inches in diameter at the top. Each
           musician held his instrument before him with both hands, and
           produced his music by striking it on the ground, where he had
           laid a piece of cloth, and beating it with his fingers, or
           the palms of his hands. As soon as they began to sound their
           calabashes, the dancer, a young man about the middle stature,
           advanced through the opening crowd.
[Page 72]
           His jet-black hair hung in loose and flowing ringlets on his
           naked shoulders; his necklace was made of a vast number of
           strings of nicely braided human hair, tied together behind,
           while a _paraoa_ (an ornament made of a whale's tooth) hung
           pendent from it on his breast; his wrists were ornamented
           with bracelets formed of polished tusks of the hog, and his
           ankles with loose buskins, thickly set with dog's teeth, the
           rattle of which, during the dance, kept time with the music
           of the calabash drum. A beautiful yellow tapa was tastefully
           fastened round his loins, reaching to his knees. He began his
           dance in front of the musicians, and moved forward and
           backwards, across the area, occasionally chanting the
           achievements of former kings of Hawaii. The governor sat at
           the end of the ring, opposite to the musicians, and appeared
           gratified with the performance, which continued until the
           evening. (Vol. IV, 100-101, London, Fisher, Son & Jackson,
           1831.)

           NOTE BY THE AUTHOR.--At the time of Mr. Ellis' visit to
           Hawaii the orthography of the Hawaiian language was still in
           a formative stage, and it is said that his counsels had
           influence in shaping it. His use of _r_ instead of _l_ in the
           words _hula, alaapapa_, and _palaoa_ may, therefore, be
           ascribed to the fact of his previous acquaintance with the
           dialects of southern Polynesia, in which the sound of _r_ to
           a large extent substitutes that of _l_, and to the
           probability that for that reason his ear was already attuned
           to the prevailing southern fashion, and his judgment
           prepossessed in that direction.

PLATE VII
IPU HULA, GOURD DRUM]

[Page 73]




                         X.--THE HULA PA-IPU, OR KUOLO


           The _pa-ipu_, called also the _kuolo_, was a hula of
           dignified character, in which all the performers maintained
           the kneeling position and accompanied their songs with the
           solemn tones of the _ipu_ (pl. vii), with which each one was
           provided. The proper handling of this drumlike instrument in
           concert with the cantillation of the mele made such demands
           upon the artist, who was both singer and instrumentalist,
           that only persons of the most approved skill and experience
           were chosen to take part in the performance of this hula.

           The manner of treating the ipu in this hula differed somewhat
           from that employed in the ala'a-papa, being subdued and quiet
           in that, whereas in the pa-ipu it was at times marked with
           great vigor and demonstrativeness, so that in moments of
           excitement and for the expression of passion, fierce joy, or
           grief the ipu might be lifted on high and wildly brandished.
           It thus made good its title as the most important instrument
           of the Hawaiian orchestra.

           In the pa-ipu, as in the hulas generally, while the actors
           were sometimes grouped according to sex, they were quite as
           often distributed indiscriminately, the place for the leader,
           the kumu, being the center.

           The vigor that marks the literary style of the mele now given
           stamps it as belonging to the archaic period, which closed in
           the early part of the eighteenth century, that century which
           saw the white man make his advent in Hawaii. The poem deals
           apparently with an incident in one of the migrations such as
           took place during the period of intercourse between the North
           and the South Pacific. This was a time of great stir and
           contention, a time when there was much paddling and sailing
           about and canoe-fleets, often manned by warriors, traversed
           the great ocean in every direction. It was then that Hawaii
           received many colonists from the archipelagoes that lie to
           the southward.

           [Footnote 189: _Olopana_. A celebrated king of Waipio valley,
           Hawaii, who had to wife the famous beauty, Luukia. Owing to
           misfortune, he sailed away to _Kahiki_, taking with him his
           wife and his younger brother, Moikeha, who was his
           _puna-lua_, settling in a land called _Moa-ula-nui-akea_.
           Olopana probably ended his days in his new-found home, but
           Moi-keha, heart-sick at the loss of Luukia's favors, came
           hack to Hawaii and became the progenitor of a line of
           distinguished men, several of whom were famous navigators.
           Exactly what incident in the life of Olopana is alluded to in
           the sixth and preceding verses, the traditions that narrate
           his adventures do not inform us.]

           [Footnote 190: _Hei kapu_. An oracle; the place where the high
           priest kept himself while consulting the deities of the
           _heiau_. It was a small house erected on an elevated platform
           of stones, and there he kept himself in seclusion at such
           times as he sought to be the recipient of communications from
           the gods.]

           [Footnote 191: _Hana-ka-ulani_. A name applied to several
           _heiau_ (temples). The first one so styled, according to
           tradition, was built at Hana, Maui, and another one at
           Kaluanui, on Oahu, near the famous valley of Ka-liu-wa'a.
           These heiau are said to have been built by the gods in the
           misty past soon after landing on these shores. Was it to
           celebrate their escape from perils by sea and enemies on
           land, or was it in token of thankfulness to gods still higher
           than themselves?

           The author's informant can not tell whether these followed
           the fierce, strict cult of Kane or the milder cult of Lono.]

           [Footnote 192: _Hoo-mamao-lani_. An epithet meaning remote in
           the heavens, applied to an alii of very high rank.]

           [Footnote 193: _Keawe_. This is a name that belonged, to
           several kings and a large family of gods--_papa akua_--all of
           which gods are said to have come from Kahiki and to have
           dated their origin from the _Wa Po_, the twilight of
           antiquity. Among the demigods that were called _Keawe_ may be
           mentioned: (1) _Keawe-huli_, a prophet and soothsayer. (2)
           _Keawe-kilo-pono_, a wise and righteous one, who loved
           justice. (3) _Keawe-hula-maemae_. It was his function to
           maintain purity and cleanliness; he was a devouring flame
           that destroyed rubbish and all foulness. (4)
           _Keawe-ula-o-ka-lani_. This was the poetical appellation,
           given to the delicate flush of early morning. Apropos of this
           the Hawaiians have the following quatrain, which they
           consider descriptive not only of morning blush, but also of
           the coming in of the reign of the gods:

                O Keawe-ula-i-ka-lani,
                O Keawe-liko-i-ka-lani,
                O Ke'awe-uina-poha-i-Kahiki;
                Hikl mai ana o Lono.[Translation]

                Keawe-the-red-blush-of-dawn,
                Keawe-the-bud-in-the-sky,
                Keawe-thunder-burst-at-Kahiki:
                Till Lono comes in to reign.

           (5) _Keawe-pa-makani_. It was his function to send winds from
           _Kukulu-o-Kahiki_, as well as from some other points. (6)
           _Keawe-io-io-moa_. This god inspected the ocean tides and
           currents, such as _Au-miki_ and _Au-ka_. (7)
           _Keawe-i-ka-liko_. He took charge of flowerbuds and tender
           shoots, giving them a chance to develop. (8) _Keawe-ulu-pu_.
           It was his function to promote the development and fruitage
           of plants. (9) _Keawe-lu-pua_. He caused flowers to shed
           their petals. (10) _Keawe-opala_. It was his thankless task
           to create rubbish and litter by scattering the leaves of the
           trees. (11) _Keawe-hulu_, a magician, who could blow a
           feather into the air and see it at once become a bird with
           power to fly away. (12) _Keawe-nui-ka-ua-o-Hilo_, a sentinel
           who stood guard by night and by day to watch over all
           creation. (13) _Keawe-pulehu_. He was a thief and served as
[Page 75]  cook for the gods. There were gods of evil as well as of good
           in this set. (14) _Keawe-oili_. He was gifted with the power
           to convey and transfer evil, sickness, misfortune, and death.
           (15) _Keawe-kaili_. He was a robber. (16) _Keawe-aihue_. He
           was a thief. (17) _Keuwe-mahilo_. He was a beggar. He would
           stand round while others were preparing food, doing honest
           work, and plead with his eyes. In this way he often obtained
           a dole. (18) _Keawe-puni-pua'a_. He was a glutton, very greedy
           of pork; he was also called _Keawe-ai-pua'a_. (19)
           _Keawe-inoino_. He was a sloven, unclean in all his ways.
           (20) _Keawe-ilio_. The only title to renown of this
           superhuman creature was his inordinate fondness for the flesh
           of the dog. So far none of the superhuman heings mentioned
           seemed fitted to the role of the Keawe of the text, who was
           passionately fond of the sea. The author had given up in
           despair, when one day, on repeating his inquiry in another
           quarter, he was rewarded by learning of--(21)
           _Keawe-i-na-'kai_. He was a resident of the region about the
           southeastern point of Molokai, called _Lae-ka-Ilio_--Cape of
           the Dog. He was extravagantly fond of the ocean and allowed
           no weather to interfere with the indulgence of his penchant.
           An epithet applied to him describes his dominating passion:
           _Keawe moe i ke kai o Kohaku_, Keawe who sleeps in (or on)
           the sea of Kohaku. It seems probable that this was the Keawe
           mentioned in the twelfth and thirteenth lines of the mele.

           The appellation _Keawe_ seems to have served as a sort of
           Jack among the demigods of the Hawaiian pantheon, on whom was
           to be laid the burden of a mongrel host of virtues and vices
           that were not assignable to the regular orthodox deities.
           Somewhat in the same way do we use the name Jack as a
           caption, for a miscellaneous lot of functions, as when we
           speak of a "Jack-at-all-trades."]

                Leaf of lehua and noni-tint, the Kona sea,
                Iridescent saffron and red,
                Changeable watered red, peculiar to Kona;
                Red are the uplands Alaea;
           5    All, 'tis the flame-red stained robes of women
                Much tossed by caress or desire.
                The weed-tangled water-way shines like a rope of pearls,
                Dew-pearls that droop the coco leaf,
                The hair of the trees, their long locks--
          10    Lo, they wilt in the heat of Kailua the deep.
                A mat spread out narrow and gray,
                A coigne of land by the sea where the fisher drops hook.
                Now looms the mount Kilohana--
                Ah, ye wood-shaded heights, everlasting your fame!
          15    Your tabu is gone! your holy of holies invaded!
                Broke down by a stranger!

           The intricately twisted language of this mele is allegorical,
           a rope whose strands are inwrought with passion, envy,
           detraction, and abuse. In translating it one has to choose
           between the poetic verbal garb and the esoteric meaning which
           the bard made to lurk beneath the surface.

                Lest Unu-lau fiercely assail you."
                Storm sweeps the cliffs of the islet;
                A covert they seek neath the hills,
                In the sheltered lee of the gale,
           10   The cove at the base of Le-hu-a.
                The shady groves there enchant them,
                The scarlet plumes of lehua.
                Love-dalliance now by the water-reeds,
                Till cooled and appeased by the rain-mist.
           15   Pour on, thou rain, the two heads press the pillow:
                Lo, prince and princess stir in their sleep!

           The scene of this mele is laid on one of the little
           bird-islands that lie to the northwest of Kauai. The _iwa_
           bird, flying heavily to his nesting place in the wiry grass
           (_kala-pahee_), symbolizes the flight of a man in his
           deep-laden pirogue, abducting the woman of his love. The
           screaming sea-birds that warn him off the island, represented
           as watch-guards of the shark-god Kuhai-moana (whose reef is
           still pointed out), figure the outcries of the parents and
           friends of the abducted woman.

           After the first passionate outburst (_Puni'a iluna o ka
           Halau-a-ola_) things go more smoothly (ola, ...). The
           flight to covert from the storm, the cove at the base of
           Le-hu-a, the shady groves, the scarlet pompons of the
           lehua--the tree and the island have the same name--all these
           things are to be interpreted figuratively as emblems of
           woman's physical charms and the delights of love-dalliance.

                A storm, from the sea strikes Ke-au,
                Ulu-mano, sweeping across the barrens;
                It sniffs the fragrance of upland lehua,
                Turns back at Kupa-koili;
            5   Sawed by the blows of the palm leaves,
                The groves of pandanus in lava shag;
                Their fruit he would string 'bout his neck;
                Their fruit he finds wilted and crushed,
                Mere rubbish to litter the road--
           10   Ah, the perfume! Pana-ewa is drunk with the scent;
                The breath of it spreads through the groves.
                Vainly flares the old king's passion,
                Craving a sauce for his meat and mine.
                The summer has flown; winter has come:
           15   Ah, that is the head of our troubles.
                Palsied are you and helpless am I;
                You shrink from a plunge in the water;
                Alas, poor me! I'm a coward.

           The imagery of this mele sets forth the story of the fierce,
           but fruitless, love-search of a chief, who is figured by the
           _Ulu-mano_, a boisterous wind of Puna, Hawaii. The fragrance
           of upland lehua (_moani lehua, a'e la mauka_, verse 3)
           typifies the charms of the woman he pursues. The expression
           _kani lehua_ (verse 4), literally the sudden ending of a
           rain-squall, signifies the man's failure to gain his object.
           The lover seeks to string the golden drupe of the pandanus
           (_halo_), that he may wear them as a wreath about his neck
           (_uwalo_); he is wounded by the teeth of the sword-leaves (_o
           ia i ka lau o ka hala_, verse 5). More than this, he meets
           powerful, concerted resistance (_ke poo o ka hala o ke
           aku'i_, verse 6), offered by the compact groves of pandanus
           that grow in the rough lava-shag (_aku'i_), typifying, no
           doubt, the resistance made by the friends and retainers of
           the woman. After all, he finds, or declares that he finds,
           the hala fruit he had sought to gather and to wear as a _lei_
           about his neck, to be spoiled, broken, fit only to litter the
           road (_loli ka mu'o o ka hala_, verse 8; _A helelei ka'pua, a
           pili ke alanui_, verse 9). In spite of his repulse and his
           vilification of the woman, his passion, still feeds on the
           thought of the one he has lost; her charms intoxicate his
           imagination, even as the perfume of the hala bloom bewitches
           the air of Pana-ewa (_Pu ia Panaewa, ona-ona i ke ala_, verse
           10).

           It is difficult to interpret verses 12 to 18 in harmony with
           the story as above given. They may be regarded as a
[Page 79]  commentary on the passionate episode in the life of the
           lover, looked at from the standpoint of old age, at a time
           when passion still survives but physical strength is in
           abeyance.

           As the sugar-boiler can not extract from the stalk the last
           grain of sugar, so the author finds it impossible in any
           translation to express the full intent of these Hawaiian
           mele.
