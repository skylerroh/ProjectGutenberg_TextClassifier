appear that the true ideal of omnipotent and ever-present good is an ideal
wherein and wherefor there is no evil. Sin exists only as a sense, and not
as Soul. Destroy this sense of sin, and sin disappears. Sickness, sin, or
death is a false sense of Life and good. Destroy this trinity of error, and
you find Truth.

In Science, Christ never died. In material sense Jesus died, and lived. The
fleshly Jesus seemed to die, though he did not. The Truth or Life in divine
Science--undisturbed by human error, sin, and death--saith forever, "I am
the living God, and man is My idea, never in matter, nor resurrected from
it." "Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen."
(Luke xxiv. 5, 6.) Mortal sense, confining itself to matter, is all that
can be buried or resurrected.

Mary had risen to discern faintly God's ever-presence, and that of His
idea, man; but her mortal sense, reversing Science and spiritual
understanding, interpreted this appearing as a risen Christ. The I
AM was neither buried nor resurrected. The Way, the Truth, and the
Life were never absent for a moment. This trinity of Love lives and reigns
forever. Its kingdom, not apparent to material sense, never disappeared to
spiritual sense, but remained forever in the Science of being. The
so-called appearing, disappearing, and reappearing of ever-presence, in
whom is no variableness or shadow of turning, is the false human sense of
that light which shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it
not.




Summary


All that _is_, God created. If sin has any pretense of existence, God is
responsible therefor; but there is no reality in sin, for God can no more
behold it, or acknowledge it, than the sun can coexist with darkness.

To build the individual spiritual sense, conscious of only health,
holiness, and heaven, on the foundations of an eternal Mind which is
conscious of sickness, sin, and death, is a moral impossibility; for "other
foundation can no man lay than that is laid." (1 Corinthians iii. 11.) The
nearer we approximate to such a Mind, even if it were (or could be) God,
the more real those mind-pictures would become to us; until the hope of
ever eluding their dread presence must yield to despair, and the haunting
sense of evil forever accompany our being.

Mortals may climb the smooth glaciers, leap the dark fissures, scale the
treacherous ice, and stand on the summit of Mont Blanc; but they can never
turn back what Deity knoweth, nor escape from identification with what
dwelleth in the eternal Mind.
