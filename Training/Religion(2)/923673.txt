O gentle, chaste, and spotless Maid,
We sinners make our pray'rs thro' thee;
Remind the Son that he has paid
The price of our iniquity.
Virgin, most pure, Star of the Sea,
Pray for the sinner, pray for me.

3.
Sojourners in this vale of tears,
To thee, blest Advocate, we cry,
Pity our sorrows, calm our fears,
And soothe with hope our misery.
Refuge in grief, Star of the Sea,
Pray for the mourner, pray for me.

4.
And while to Him Who reigns above,
In God-head One, in Persons Three,
The Source of life, of grace, of love,
Homage we pay on bended knee
Do thou, bright Queen, Star of the Sea,
Pray for the children, pray for me.

Remember, holy Mary
Memorare

St. Bernard
Tr. Rev. M. Russell, S.J. from a Slovak Hymnal
Adapted by N.A.M.


Moderato

1.
Remember, Holy Mary,
'Twas never heard or known
That any one who sought thee
And made to thee his moan,
That any one who hastened
For shelter to thy care,
Was ever yet abandoned
And left to his despair.

2.
And so to thee, my Mother,
With filial faith I call,
For Jesus dying gave thee
As Mother to us all.
To thee, O Queen of virgins,
O Mother meek, to thee
I run with trustful fondness,
Like child to mother's knee.

3.
See at thy feet a sinner,
Groaning and weeping sore
Ah! Throw thy mantle o'er me,
And let me stray no more.
Thy Son has died to save me,
And from His throne on high
His heart this moment yearneth
For even such as I.

4.
All, all His love remember,
And oh! Remember too
How prompt I am to purpose,
How slow and frail to do.
Yet scorn not my petitions,
But patiently give ear,
And help me, O my Mother,
Most loving and most dear.

1.
Hear thy children, gentlest Mother,
Pray'rful hearts to thee arise;
Hear us while our evening Ave
Soars beyond the starry skies.
Darkling shadows fall around us,
Stars their silent watches keep;
Hush the heart oppress'd with sorrow,
Dry the tears of those who weep.

2.
Hear, sweet Mother, hear the weary,
Borne upon life's troubled sea;
Gentle guiding Star of Ocean,
Lead thy children home to thee.
Still watch o'er us, dearest Mother,
From thy beauteous throne above;
Guard us from all harm and danger,
'Neath thy shelt'ring wings of love.

Mother of Christ

Not too slow (alla breve)

1.
Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
What shall I ask of thee?
I do not sigh for the wealth of earth,
For joys that fade and flee;
But, Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
This do I long to see,
The bliss untold which thine arms enfold,
The treasure upon thy knee.

2.
Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
What shall I do for thee?
I love thy Son with my whole strength
My only King shall he be.
Yes, Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
This I do ask of thee,
Of all that are dear or cherished here,
None shall be dear as He.

3.
Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
I toss on a stormy sea,
O lift thy child as beacon high
To the port where I fain would be,
Then, Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
This do I ask of thee,
When the voyage is o'er, O stand on the shore
And show Him at last to me.

1.
O Mother! Most afflicted,
Standing beneath that tree,
Where Jesus hangs rejected
On the hill of Calvary!

Refrain
O Mary! sweetest Mother,
We love to pity thee;
O! for the sake of Jesus
Let us thy children be.

2.
Thy heart is well-nigh breaking,
Thy Jesus thus to see,
Derided, wounded, dying,
In greatest agony.

3.
His livid Form is bleeding,
His Soul with sorrow wrung,
Whilst thou, afflicted Mother,
Shar'st the torments of thy Son.

4.
O Mary! Queen of Martyrs,
The sword had pierced thy heart,
Obtain for us of Jesus
In thy grief to bear apart.

5.
O dear and loving Mother!
Entreat that we may be
Near thee and thy dear Jesus
Now and eternally

Melody from the Trier Gesangbuch (1872)


Moderato

1.
O blessed Saint Joseph, how great was thy worth,
The one chosen shadow of God upon earth,
The father of Jesus! Ah then, wilt thou be,
Sweet spouse of our Lady! A father to me?

2.
For thou to the pilgrim art father and guide,
And Jesus and Mary felt safe by thy side;
Ah, blessed Saint Joseph, how safe I should be,
Sweet spouse of our Lady! If thou wert with me!

3.
When the treasures of God where unsheltered on earth,
Safe keeping was found them both in thy worth;
O father of Jesus, be father to me,
Sweet spouse of our Lady! And I will love thee.

Great Saint Joseph! Son of David
Du aus David's

Translated by Bishop Casartelli from a Slovak Hymnal
Arr. by N. A. M.


Con Spirito

1.
Great Saint Joseph! Son of David,
Foster father of our Lord,
Spouse of Mary ever Virgin,
Keeping o'er them watch and ward!
In the stable thou didst guard them
With a father's loving care;
Thou by God's command didst save them
From the cruel Herod's snare.

2.
Three long days in grief and anguish
With His Mother sweet and mild,
Mary Virgin, didst thou wander
Seeking the beloved Child.
In the temple thou didst find Him:
Oh! What joy then filled thy heart!
In thy sorrows, in thy gladness
Grant us, Joseph, to have a part.

3.
Clasped in Jesus' arms and Mary's,
When death gently came at last,
Thy pure spirit sweetly sighing
From its earthly dwelling passed.
Dear Saint Joseph! By that passing
May our death be like to thine;
And with Jesus, Mary, Joseph,
May our souls forever shine.

Te Joseph Celebrent

Translated by Father Caswall

Devoto (alla breve)

1.
Joseph, pure spouse of that immortal Bride;
Who shines in ever-virgin glory bright,
Thro' all the Christian climes the praise be sung,
Thro' all the realms of light.

2.
Thine arms embraced thy Maker newly born:
With Him to Egypt's desert didst thou flee:
Him in Jerusalem didst seek and find;
O grief, O joy for thee.

3.
Not until after death their blissful crown
Other obtain, but unto thee was giv'n,
In thine own lifetime to enjoy thy God
As do the blest in Heav'n.

4.
Grant us great Trinity, for Joseph's sake
Unto the starry mansions to attain;
There, with glad tongues, thy praise to celebrate
In one eternal strain.

And guide the steps that fail.
Hail, holy Joseph, hail!

To thee the Word made flesh,
Was subject as a Son.
