
And give to us souls, dear Lord . . . We thirst for souls!--Above
all for the souls of Apostles and Martyrs . . . that through them
we may inflame all poor sinners with love of Thee.

O Adorable Face, we shall succeed in winning this grace from Thee!
Unmindful of our exile, "by the rivers of Babylon," we will sing
in Thine Ears the sweetest of melodies. Since Thou art the true
and only Home of our souls, _our songs shall not be sung in a
strange land._[6] O Beloved Face of Jesus, while we await the
Eternal Day when we shall gaze upon Thine Infinite Glory, our only
desire is to delight Thy Divine Eyes by keeping our faces hidden
too, so that no one on earth may recognize us . . . Dear Jesus,
Heaven for us is Thy Hidden Face!


VARIOUS PRAYERS

_"If you ask the Father anything in My Name, He will give it
you."_-- John 16:23.

O Eternal Father, Thy Only-Begotten Son, the dear Child Jesus,
belongs to me since Thou hast given Him. I offer Thee the infinite
merits of His Divine Childhood, and I beseech Thee in His Name to
open the gates of Heaven to a countless host of little ones who
will for ever follow this Divine Lamb.

_"Just as the King's image is a talisman through which anything
may be purchased in his Kingdom, so through My Adorable Face--that
priceless coin of my Humanity--you will obtain all you desire."_
        Our Lord to Sister Mary of St. Peter.[7]

Eternal Father, since Thou hast given me for my inheritance the
Adorable Face of Thy Divine Son, I offer that Face to Thee, and I
beg Thee, in exchange for this _coin_ of infinite value, to forget
the ingratitude of those souls who are consecrated to Thee, and to
pardon all poor sinners.


PRAYER TO THE HOLY CHILD

O Jesus, dear Holy Child, my only treasure, I abandon myself to
Thy every whim. I seek no other joy than that of calling forth Thy
sweet Smile. Vouchsafe to me the graces and the virtues of Thy
Holy Childhood, so that on the day of my birth into Heaven the
Angels and Saints may recognise in Thy Spouse: _Teresa of the
Child Jesus._


PRAYER TO THE HOLY FACE

O Adorable Face of Jesus, sole beauty which ravisheth my heart,
vouchsafe to impress on my soul Thy Divine Likeness, so that it
may not be possible for Thee to look at Thy Spouse without
beholding Thyself. O my Beloved, for love of Thee I am content not
to see here on earth the sweetness of Thy Glance, nor to feel the
ineffable Kiss of Thy Sacred Lips, but I beg of Thee to inflame me
with Thy Love, so that it may consume me quickly, and that soon
_Teresa of the Holy Face_ may behold Thy glorious Countenance in
Heaven.


PRAYER

_Inspired by the sight of a statue of The Blessed Joan of Arc_

O Lord God of Hosts, who hast said in Thy Gospel: "I am not come
to bring peace but a sword,"[8] arm me for the combat. I burn to
do battle for Thy Glory, but I pray Thee to enliven my
courage. . . . Then with holy David I shall be able to exclaim:
"Thou alone art my shield; it is Thou, O Lord Who teachest my
hands to fight."[9]

O my Beloved, I know the warfare in which I am to engage; it is
not on the open field I shall fight. . . . I am a prisoner held
captive by Thy Love; of my own free will I have riveted the
fetters which bind me to Thee, and cut me off for ever from the
world. My sword is Love! with it--like Joan of Arc--"I will drive
the strangers from the land, and I will have Thee proclaimed
King"--over the Kingdom of souls.

Of a truth Thou hast no need of so weak an instrument as I, but
Joan, thy chaste and valiant Spouse, has said: "We must do battle
before God gives the victory." O my Jesus! I will do battle, then,
for Thy love, until the evening of my life. As Thou didst not will
to enjoy rest upon earth, I wish to follow Thy example; and then
this promise which came from thy Sacred Lips will be fulfilled in
me: "If any man minister to me, let him follow Me, and where I am
there also shall My servant be, and . . . him will My Father
honour."[10] To be with Thee, to be in Thee, that is my one
desire; this promise of fulfilment, which Thou dost give, helps me
to bear with my exile as I wait the joyous Eternal Day when I
shall see Thee face to face.


PRAYER TO OBTAIN HUMILITY

_Written for a Novice_

O JESUS! When Thou wast a wayfarer upon earth, Thou didst
say:--"Learn of Me, for I am Meek and Humble of Heart, and you
shall find rest to your souls."[11] O Almighty King of Heaven! my
soul indeed finds rest in seeing Thee condescend to wash the feet
of Thy Apostles--"having taken the form of a slave."[12] I recall
the words Thou didst utter to teach me the practice of humility:
"I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you
do also. The servant is not greater than his Lord . . . If you
know these things, you shall be blessed if you do them."[13] I
understand, dear Lord, these words which come from Thy Meek and
Humble Heart, and I wish to put them in practice with the help of
Thy grace.

I desire to humble myself in all sincerity, and to submit my will
to that of my Sisters, without ever contradicting them, and
without questioning whether they have the right to command. No
one, O my Beloved! had that right over Thee, and yet Thou didst
obey not only the Blessed Virgin and St. Joseph, but even Thy
executioners. And now, in the Holy Eucharist, I see Thee complete
Thy self-abasement. O Divine King of Glory, with wondrous
humility, Thou dost submit Thyself to all Thy Priests, without any
distinction between those who love Thee and those who, alas! are
lukewarm or cold in Thy service. They may advance or delay the
hour of the Holy Sacrifice: Thou art always ready to come down
from Heaven at their call.

O my Beloved, under the white Eucharistic Veil Thou dost indeed
appear to me Meek and Humble of Heart! To teach me humility, Thou
canst not further abase Thyself, and so I wish to respond to Thy
Love, by putting myself in the lowest place, by sharing Thy
humiliations, so that I may "have part with Thee"[14] in the
Kingdom of Heaven.

I implore Thee, dear Jesus, to send me a humiliation whensoever I
try to set myself above others.

And yet, dear Lord, Thou knowest my weakness. Each morning I
resolve to be humble, and in the evening I recognise that I have
often been guilty of pride. The sight of these faults tempts me to
discouragement; yet I know that discouragement is itself but a
form of pride. I wish, therefore, O my God, to build all my trust
upon Thee. As Thou canst do all things, deign to implant in my
soul this virtue which I desire, and to obtain it from Thy
Infinite Mercy, I will often say to Thee: "Jesus, Meek and Humble
of Heart, make my heart like unto Thine."

SELECTED POEMS OF SOEUR THERESE, THE LITTLE FLOWER OF JESUS


MY SONG OF TO-DAY

Oh! how I love Thee, Jesus! my soul aspires to Thee--
   And yet for one day only my simple prayer I pray!
Come reign within my heart, smile tenderly on me,
      To-day, dear Lord, to-day!

But if I dare take thought of what the morrow brings,
   It fills my fickle heart with dreary, dull dismay;
I crave, indeed, my God, the Cross and sufferings,
      But only for to-day!

O sweetest Star of Heaven! O Virgin, spotless, blest,
   Shining with Jesus' light, guiding to Him my way!
Mother! beneath thy veil let my tired spirit rest,
      For this brief passing day!

Soon shall I fly afar among the holy choirs,
   Then shall be mine the joy that knoweth no decay;
And then my lips shall sing, to Heaven's angelic lyres,
      The eternal, glad To-day!

June, 1894.


MEMORIES

Selected Stanzas

"I find in my Beloved the mountains, the lonely and wooded
vales, the distant isles, the murmur of the waters, the soft
whisper of the zephyrs . . . the quiet night with its sister
the dawn, the perfect solitude--all that delights and all
that fires our love."--St. John of the Cross.

I hold full sweet your memory,
My childhood days, so glad, so free.
To keep my innocence, dear Lord, for Thee,
Thy Love came to me night and day,
      Alway.
.   .   .   .   .   .   .

I loved the swallows' graceful flight,
The turtle doves' low chant at night,
The pleasant sound of insects gay and bright,
The grassy vale where doth belong
      Their song.
.   .   .   .   .   .   .

I loved the glow-worm on the sod;
The countless stars, so near to God,
But most I loved, in all the sky abroad,
The shining moon of silver bright,
      At night.
.   .   .   .   .   .   .

The grass is withered in its bed;
The flowers within my hands are dead.
Would that my weary feet, Jesu! might tread
Thy Heavenly Fields, and I might be
      With Thee!
.   .   .   .   .   .   .

My rainbow in the rain-washed skies--
Horizon where my suns arise--
My isle in far-off seas--pearl I most prize--
Sweet spring and butterflies--I see
      In Thee!
.   .   .   .   .   .   .

In Thee I have the springs, the rills,
The mignonette, the daffodils,
The Eglantine, the harebell on the hills,
The trembling poplar, sighing low
      And slow.
.   .   .   .   .   .   .

The lovely lake, the valley fair
And lonely in the lambent air,
The ocean touched with silver everywhere--
In Thee their treasures, all combined,
      I find.
.   .   .   .   .   .   .

I go to chant, with Angel-throngs,
The homage that to Thee belongs.
Soon let me fly away, to join their songs!
Oh, let me die of love, I pray,
      One day!
.   .   .   .   .   .   .

I hear, e'en I, Thy last and least,
The music from Thy Heavenly Feast;
There, deign receive me as Thy loving guest
And, to my harp, let me but sing,
      My King!
.   .   .   .   .   .   .

Unto the Saints I shall be near,
To Mary, and those once treasured here.
Life is all past, and dried is every tear;
To me my home again is given--
      In Heaven.

April 28, 1895.


I THIRST FOR LOVE

In wondrous Love, Thou didst come down from Heaven
   To immolate Thyself, O Christ, for me;
So, in my turn, my love to Thee is given--
   I wish to suffer and to die for Thee.

Thou, Lord, didst speak this truth benign:
   "To die for one loved tenderly,
Of greatest love on earth is sign";
   And now, such love is mine--
      Such love for Thee!

Do Thou abide with me, O Pilgrim blest!
   Behind the hill fast sinks the dying day.
Helped by Thy Cross, I mount the rocky crest;
   Oh, come, to guide me on my Heavenward Way.

To be like Thee is my desire;
   Thy Voice finds echo in my soul.
Suffering I crave! Thy words of fire
   Lift me above earth's mire,
      And sin's control.

Chanting Thy victories, gloriously sublime,
   The Seraphim--all Heaven--cry to me,
That even Thou, to conquer sin and crime,
   Upon this earth a sufferer needs must be.

For me upon life's dreary way
   What scorn, what anguish, Thou didst bear!
Let me but hide me day by day,
   Be least of all, alway,
      Thy lot to share.

Ah, Christ! Thy great example teaches me
   Myself to humble, honours to despise.
A little one--as Thou--I choose to be,
   Forgetting self, so I may charm Thine Eyes.

My peace I find in solitude,
   Nor ask I more, dear Lord, than this:
Be Thou my sole beatitude,
   And ever--in Thee--renewed
      My joy, my bliss!

Thou, the great God Whom earth and Heaven adore,
   Thou dwell'st a prisoner for me night and day;
And every hour I hear Thy Voice implore:
   "I thirst--I thirst--I thirst--for love alway!"

I, too, Thy prisoner am I;
   I, too, cry ever unto Thee
Thine own divine and tender cry:
   "I thirst!" Oh, let me die
      Of love for Thee.

For love of Thee I thirst! fulfil my hope;
   Augment in me Thine own celestial flame!
For love of Thee I thirst! too scant earth's scope:
   The glorious Vision of Thy Face I claim!

My long, slow martyrdom of fire
   Still more and more consumeth me.
Thou art my joy, my one desire,
   Jesu! may I expire
      Of love for Thee.

April 30, 1896.


TO SCATTER FLOWERS

O Jesus! O my Love! each eve I come to fling
   My springtide roses sweet before Thy Cross divine;
By their plucked petals fair, my hands so gladly bring,
      I long to dry Thine every tear!

To scatter flowers!--that means each sacrifice:
   My lightest sighs and pains, my heaviest, saddest hours,
My hopes, my joys, my prayers--I will not count the price--
      Behold my flowers!

With deep untold delight Thy beauty fills my soul,
