from the great Master this answer to the questions of the [25]
rabbinical rabble: "If I tell you, ye will not believe; and
if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go."

Infinitely greater than human pity, is divine Love,--
that cannot be unmerciful. Human tribunals, if just,
borrow their sense of justice from the divine Principle [30]
thereof, which punishes the guilty, not the innocent. The
Teacher of both law and gospel construed the substitution

[Page 122.]

of a good man to suffer for evil-doers--a _crime_! When [1]
foretelling his own crucifixion, he said, "Woe unto the
world because of offenses! for it must needs be that
offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense
cometh!" [5]

Would Jesus thus have spoken of what was indis-
pensable for the salvation of a world of sinners, or of the
individual instrument in this holy (?) alliance for accom-
plishing such a monstrous work? or have said of him
whom God foreordained and predestined to fulfil a divine [10]
decree, "It were better for him that a millstone were
hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the
depth of the sea"?

The divine order is the acme of mercy: it is neither
questionable nor assailable: it is not evil producing good, [15]
nor good ultimating in evil. Such an inference were
impious. Holy Writ denounces him that declares, "Let
us do evil, that good may come! whose damnation is
just."

Good is not educed from its opposite: and Love divine [20]
spurned, lessens not the hater's hatred nor the criminal's
crime; nor reconciles justice to injustice; nor substitutes
the suffering of the Godlike for the suffering due to sin.
Neither spiritual bankruptcy nor a religious chancery can
win high heaven, or the "Well done, good and faithful [25]
servant,... enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."

Divine Love knows no hate; for hate, or the hater, is
nothing: God never made it, and He made all that was
made. The hater's pleasures are unreal; his sufferings,
self-imposed; his existence is a parody, and he ends-- [30]
with suicide.

The murder of the just Nazarite was incited by the

[Page 123.]

same spirit that in our time massacres our missionaries, [1]
butchers the helpless Armenians, slaughters innocents.
Evil was, and is, the illusion of breaking the First Com-
mandment, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me:"
it is either idolizing something and somebody, or hating [5]
them: it is the spirit of idolatry, envy, jealousy, covet-
ousness, superstition, lust, hypocrisy, _witchcraft_.

That man can break the forever-law of infinite Love,
was, and is, the serpent's biggest lie! and ultimates in
a religion of pagan priests bloated with crime; a religion [10]
that demands human victims to be sacrificed to human
passions and human gods, or tortured to appease the
anger of a so-called god or a miscalled man or woman!
The Assyrian Merodach, or the god of sin, was the "lucky
god;" and the Babylonian Yawa, or Jehovah, was the [15]
Jewish tribal deity. The _Christian's_ God is neither, and
is too pure to behold iniquity.

Divine Science has rolled away the stone from the sepul-
chre of our Lord; and there has risen to the awakened
thought the majestic atonement of divine Love. The [20]
at-one-ment with Christ has appeared--not through
vicarious suffering, whereby the just obtain a pardon for
the unjust,--but through the eternal law of justice;
wherein sinners suffer for their own sins, repent, forsake
sin, love God, and keep His commandments, thence to [25]
receive the reward of righteousness: salvation from sin,
not through the _death_ of a man, but through a divine _Life_,
which is our Redeemer.

Holy Writ declares that God is Love, is Spirit; hence
it follows that those who worship Him, must worship [30]
Him spiritually,--far apart from physical sensation
such as attends eating and drinking corporeally. It is

[Page 124.]

plain that aught unspiritual, intervening between God [1]
and man, would tend to disturb the divine order, and
countermand the Scripture that those who worship the
Father must worship Him in spirit. It is also plain,
that we should not seek and cannot find God in mat- [5]
ter, or through material methods; neither do we love
and obey Him by means of matter, or the flesh,--which
warreth against Spirit, and will not be reconciled
thereto.

We turn, with sickened sense, from a pagan Jew's [10]
or Moslem's misconception of Deity, for peace; and find
rest in the spiritual ideal, or Christ. For "who is so
great a God as our God!" unchangeable, all-wise, all-
just, all-merciful; the ever-loving, ever-living Life, Truth,
Love: comforting such as mourn, opening the prison [15]
doors to the captive, marking the unwinged bird, pitying
with more than a father's pity; healing the sick, cleansing
the leper, raising the dead, saving sinners. As we think
thereon, man's true sense is filled with peace, and power;
and we say, It is well that Christian Science has taken [20]
expressive silence wherein to muse His praise, to kiss the
feet of Jesus, adore the white Christ, and stretch out our
arms to God.

The last act of the tragedy on Calvary rent the veil
of matter, and unveiled Love's great legacy to mortals: [25]
_Love forgiving its enemies_. This grand act crowned
and still crowns Christianity: it manumits mortals; it
translates love; it gives to suffering, inspiration; to
patience, experience; to experience, hope; to hope, faith;
to faith, understanding; and to understanding, Love tri- [30]
umphant!

In proportion to a man's spiritual progress, he will

[Page 125.]

indeed drink of our Master's cup, and be baptized with [1]
his baptism! be purified as by fire,--the fires of suffering;
then hath he part in Love's atonement, for "whom the
Lord loveth He chasteneth." Then shall he also reign
with him: he shall rise to know that there is no sin, [5]
that there is no suffering; since all that is _real_ is _right_.
This knowledge enables him to overcome the world, the
flesh, and all evil, to have dominion over his own sinful
sense and self. Then shall he drink anew Christ's cup,
in the kingdom of God--the reign of righteousness-- [10]
within him; he shall sit down at the Father's right hand:
_sit down_; not stand waiting and weary; but rest on the
bosom of God; rest, in the understanding of divine Love
that passeth all understanding; rest, in that which "to
know aright is Life eternal," and whom, not having seen, [15]
we love.

Then shall he press on to Life's long lesson, the eternal
lore of Love; and learn forever the infinite meanings of
these short sentences: "God is Love;" and, All that is
real is divine, for God is All-in-all. [20]




Message To The Annual Meeting Of The Mother Church, Boston, 1896


_Beloved Brethren, Children, and Grandchildren_:--
Apart from the common walks of mankind, revolving
oft the hitherto untouched problems of being, and [25]
oftener, perhaps, the controversies which baffle it,
Mother, thought-tired, turns to-day to you; turns to
her dear church, to tell the towers thereof the remarkable
achievements that have been ours within the past few
years: the rapid transit from halls to churches, from un- [30]

[Page 126.]

settled questions to permanence, from danger to escape, [1]
from fragmentary discourses to one eternal sermon; yea,
from darkness to daylight, in physics and metaphysics.

Truly, I half wish for society again; for once, at least,
to hear the soft music of our Sabbath chimes saluting the [5]
ear in tones that leap for joy, with love for God and
man.

Who hath not learned that when alone he has his
own thoughts to guard, and when struggling with man-
kind his temper, and in society his tongue? We also [10]
have gained higher heights; have learned that trials lift
us to that dignity of Soul which sustains us, and finally
conquers them; and that the ordeal refines while it
chastens.

Perhaps our church is not yet quite sensible of what [15]
we owe to the strength, meekness, honesty, and obedi-
ence of the Christian Science Board of Directors; to
the able editors of _The Christian Science Journal_, and
to our efficient Publishing Society.

No reproof is so potent as the silent lesson of a good [20]
example. Works, more than words, should characterize
Christian Scientists. Most people condemn evil-doing,
evil-speaking; yet nothing circulates so rapidly: even gold
is less current. Christian Scientists have a strong race to
run, and foes in ambush; but bear in mind that, in the [25]
long race, honesty always defeats dishonesty.

God hath indeed smiled on my church,--this
daughter of Zion: she sitteth in high places; and to de-
ride her is to incur the penalty of which the Hebrew
bard spake after this manner: "He that sitteth in the [30]
heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in
derision."

[Page 127.]

Hitherto, I have observed that in proportion as this [1]
church has smiled on His "little ones," He has blessed
her. Throughout my entire connection with The Mother
Church, I have seen, that in the ratio of her love for
others, hath His love been bestowed upon her; watering [5]
her waste places, and enlarging her borders.

One thing I have greatly desired, and again earnestly
request, namely, that Christian Scientists, here and
elsewhere, pray daily for themselves; not verbally, nor
on bended knee, but mentally, meekly, and importu- [10]
nately. When a hungry heart petitions the divine Father-
Mother God for bread, it is not given a stone,--but
more grace, obedience, and love. If this heart, humble
and trustful, faithfully asks divine Love to feed it with the
bread of heaven, health, holiness, it will be conformed to [15]
a fitness to receive the answer to its desire; then will flow
into it the "river of His pleasure," the tributary of divine
Love, and great growth in Christian Science will follow,--
even that joy which finds one's own in another's good.

To love, and to be loved, one must do good to others. [20]
The inevitable condition whereby to become blessed, is to
bless others: but here, you must so know yourself, under
God's direction, that you will do His will even though
your pearls be downtrodden. Ofttimes the rod is His
means of grace; then it must be ours,--we cannot avoid [25]
wielding it if we reflect Him.

Wise sayings and garrulous talk may fall to the ground,
rather than on the ear or heart of the hearer; but a tender
sentiment felt, or a kind word spoken, at the right moment,
is never wasted. Mortal mind presents phases of charac- [30]
ter which need close attention and examination. The
human heart, like a feather bed, needs often to be _stirred_,

[Page 128.]

sometimes roughly, and given a variety of _turns_, else it [1]
grows hard and uncomfortable whereon to repose.

The lessons of this so-called life in matter are too vast
and varied to learn or to teach briefly; and especially
within the limits of a letter. Therefore I close here, [5]
with the apostle's injunction: "Finally, brethren, what-
soever things are true, whatsoever things are honest,
whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,
whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of
good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any [10]
praise, think on these things. Those things, which ye
have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in
me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you."

With love, Mother,
MARY BAKER G. EDDY





CHAPTER V. LETTERS.


[Page 129.]




To The Mother Church.


My Beloved Brethren:--If a member of the church
is inclined to be uncharitable, or to condemn his
brother without cause, let him put his finger to his lips,
and forgive others as he would _be_ forgiven. One's first [5]
lesson is to learn one's self; having done this, one will
naturally, through grace from God, forgive his brother and
love his enemies. To avenge an imaginary or an actual
wrong, is suicidal. The law of our God and the rule of
our church is to tell thy brother his fault and thereby help [10]
him. If this rule fails in effect, then take the next Scrip-
tural step: drop this member's name from the church, and
thereafter "let the dead bury their dead,"--let silence
prevail over his remains.

If a man is jealous, envious, or revengeful, he will seek [15]
occasion to balloon an atom of another man's indis-
cretion, inflate it, and send it into the atmosphere of mortal
mind--for other green eyes to gaze on: he will always
find somebody in his way, and try to push him aside;
will see somebody's faults to magnify under the lens that [20]
he never turns on himself.

What have been your Leader's precepts and example!
Were they to save the sinner, and to spare his exposure

[Page 130.]

so long as a hope remained of thereby benefiting him? [1]

Has her life exemplified long-suffering, meekness, charity,
purity?

She readily leaves the answer to those who know
her. [5]

Do we yet understand how much better it is to be
wronged, than to commit wrong? What do we find in
the Bible, and in the Christian Science textbook, on this
subject? Does not the latter instruct you that looking
continually for a fault in somebody else, talking about it, [10]
thinking it over, and how to meet it,--"rolling sin as a
sweet morsel under your tongue,"--has the same power
to make you a sinner that acting thus regarding disease
has to make a man sick? Note the Scripture on this
subject: "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the [15]
Lord."

The Christian Science Board of Directors has borne
the burden in the heat of the day, and it ought not to
be expected that they could have accomplished, without
one single mistake, such Herculean tasks as they have [20]
accomplished. He who judges others should know well
whereof he speaks. Where the motive to do right exists,
and the majority of one's acts are right, we should avoid
referring to past mistakes. The greatest sin that one can
commit against himself is to wrong one of God's "little [25]
ones."

Know ye not that he who exercises the largest charity,
and waits on God, renews his strength, and is exalted?
Love is not puffed up; and the meek and loving, God
anoints and appoints to lead the line of mankind's tri- [30]
umphal march out of the wilderness, out of darkness
into light.

[Page 131.]

Whoever challenges the errors of others and cherishes [1]
his own, can neither help himself nor others; he will be
called a moral nuisance, a fungus, a microbe, a mouse
gnawing at the vitals of humanity. The darkness in
one's self must first be cast out, in order rightly to discern [5]
darkness or to reflect light.

If the man of more than average avoirdupois kneels on
a stool in church, let the leaner sort console this brother's
necessity by doing likewise. Christian Scientists preserve
unity, and so shadow forth the substance of our sublime [10]
faith, and the evidence of its being built upon the rock of
divine oneness,--one faith, one God, one baptism.

If our Board of Directors is prepared to itemize a report
of the first financial year since the erection of the edifice of
The First Church of Christ, Scientist, let it do so; other- [15]
wise, I recommend that you waive the church By-law
relating to finances this year of your firstfruits. This
Board did not act under that By-law; it was not in ex-
istence all of the year. It is but just to consider the great
struggles with perplexities and difficulties which the [20]
Directors encountered in Anno Domini 1894, and which
they have overcome. May God give unto us all that loving
sense of gratitude which delights in the opportunity to
cancel accounts. I, for one, would be pleased to have the
Christian Science Board of Directors itemize a bill of this [25]
church's gifts to Mother; and then to have them let her
state the value thereof, if, indeed, it could be estimated.

After this financial year, when you call on the members
of the Christian Science Board of Directors to itemize or
audit their accounts, these will be found already itemized, [30]
and last year's records immortalized, with perils past and
victories won.

[Page 132.]

A motion was made, and a vote passed, at your last [1]
meeting, on a subject the substance whereof you had al-
ready accepted as a By-law. But, I shall take this as a
favorable omen, a fair token that heavy lids are opening,
even wider than before, to the light of Love--and By-laws. [5]

Affectionately yours,
MARY BAKER EDDY




To ----, On Prayer.


MASSACHUSETTS METAPHYSICAL COLLEGE,
571 COLUMBUS AVENUE, [10]
BOSTON, March 21, 1885

_Dear Sir_:--In your communication to _Zion's Herald_,
March 18, under the heading, "Prayer and Healing; sup-
plemental," you state that you would "like to hear from
Dr. Cullis; and, by the way, from Mrs. Eddy, also." [15]

Because of the great demand upon my time, consisting
in part of dictating answers through my secretary, or an-
swering personally manifold letters and inquiries from all
quarters,--having charge of a church, editing a maga-
zine, teaching Christian Science, receiving calls, etc.,--I [20]
find it inconvenient to accept your invitation to answer
you through the medium of a newspaper; but, for infor-
mation as to what I believe and teach, would refer you to
the Holy Scriptures, to my various publications, and to my
Christian students. [25]

It was with a thrill of pleasure that I read in your arti-
cle these words: "If we have in any way misrepresented
either Dr. Cullis or Mrs. Eddy, we are sorry." Even the
desire to be just is a vital spark of Christianity. And those
words inspire me with the hope that you wish to be just. [30]

[Page 133.]

If this is so, you will not delay corrections of the statement [1]
you make at the close of your article, when referring to
me, "the pantheistic and prayerless Mrs. Eddy, of Boston."

It would be difficult to build a sentence of so few words
conveying ideas more opposite to the fact. [5]

In refutation of your statement that I am a pantheist,
I request you to read my sermons and publications.

As to being "prayerless," I call your attention and
deep consideration to the following Scripture, that voices
my impressions of prayer:-- [10]

"When thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and
in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men....
But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet,
and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father [15]
which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret
shall reward thee openly."

I hope I am not wrong in literally following the dictum
of Jesus; and, were it not because of my desire to set
you right on this question, I should feel a delicacy in mak- [20]
ing the following statement:--

Three times a day, I retire to seek the divine blessing
on the sick and sorrowing, with my face toward the Jeru-
salem of Love and Truth, in silent prayer to the Father
which "seeth in secret," and with childlike confidence that [25]
He will reward "openly." In the midst of depressing care
and labor I turn constantly to divine Love for guidance,
and find rest. It affords me great joy to be able to attest to
the truth of Jesus' words. Love makes all burdens light,
it giveth a peace that passeth understanding, and with [30]
"signs following." As to the peace, it is unutterable; as
to "signs," behold the sick who are healed, the sorrowful

[Page 134.]

who are made hopeful, and the sinful and ignorant who [1]
have become "wise unto salvation"!

And now, dear sir, as you have expressed contrition for
an act which you have immediately repeated, you are
placed in this dilemma: To reiterate such words of [5]
apology as characterize justice and Christianity.

Very truly,
MARY BAKER G. EDDY




To The National Christian Scientist Association.


_Beloved Students_:--Meet together and meet _en masse_, [10]
in 1888, at the annual session of the National Christian
Scientist Association. Be "of one mind," "in one place,"
and God will pour you out a blessing such as you never
before received. He who dwelleth in eternal light is
bigger than the shadow, and will guard and guide His [15]
own.

Let no consideration bend or outweigh your purpose
to be in Chicago on June 13. Firm in your allegiance to
the reign of universal harmony, go to its rescue. In God's
hour, the powers of earth and hell are proven powerless. [20]
The reeling ranks of _materia medica_, with poisons, nos-
trums, and knives, are impotent when at war with the
omnipotent! Like Elisha, look up, and behold: "They
that be with us, are more than they that be with them."

Error is only fermenting, and its heat hissing at the [25]
"still, small voice" of Truth; but it can neither silence
nor disarm God's voice. Spiritual wickedness is stand-
ing in high places; but, blind to its own fate, it will tumble
into the bottomless.

[Page 135.]

Christians, and all _true_ Scientists, marching under what- [1]
soever ensign, come into the ranks! Again I repeat, per-
son is not in the question of Christian Science. Principle,
instead of person, is next to our hearts, on our lips, and
in our lives. Our watchwords are Truth and Love; and [5]
if we abide in these, they will abound in us, and we shall
be one in heart,--one in motive, purpose, pursuit. Abid-
ing in Love, not one of you can be separated from me; and
the sweet sense of journeying on together, doing unto
others as ye would they should do unto you, conquers all [10]
opposition, surmounts all obstacles, and secures success.
If you falter, or fail to fulfil this Golden Rule, though you
should build to the heavens, you would build on sand.

Is it a cross to give one week's time and expense to the
jubilee of Spirit? Then take this cross, and the crown [15]
with it. Sending forth currents of Truth, God's methods
and means of healing, and so spreading the gospel of
Love, is in itself an eternity of joy that outweighs an
hour. Add one more noble offering to the unity of good,
and so cement the bonds of Love. [20]

With love,
MARY BAKER EDDY




To The College Association.


Letter read at the meeting of the Massachusetts Metaphysical
College Association, June 3, 1891. [25]

TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS' ASSOCIATION OF
THE MASSACHUSETTS METAPHYSICAL COLLEGE

_My Beloved Students_:--You may be looking to see me
in my accustomed place with you, but this you must no

[Page 136.]

longer expect. When I retired from the field of labor, [1]
it was a departure, socially, publicly, and finally, from
the routine of such material modes as society and our
societies demand. Rumors are rumors,--nothing more.
I am still with you on the field of battle, taking forward [5]
marches, broader and higher views, and with the hope
that you will follow.

The eternal and infinite, already brought to your
earnest consideration, so grow upon my vision that I
cannot feel justified in turning aside for one hour from [10]
contemplation of them and of the faith unfeigned.
When the verities of being seem to you as to me,--as
they must some time,--you will understand the neces-
sity for my seclusion, and its fulfilment of divine order.
"Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye sepa- [15]
rate, saith the Lord."

All our thoughts should be given to the absolute
demonstration of Christian Science. You can well
afford to give me up, since you have in my last re-
vised edition of Science and Health your teacher and [20]
guide.

I recommend that the June session of this honorable
body shall close your meetings for the summer; also, that
hereafter you hold three sessions annually, convening
once in four months; oftener is not requisite, and the [25]
members coming from a distance will be accommodated
by this arrangement.

Yours affectionately,
MARY B. G. EDDY

[Page 137.]




To The National Christian Scientist Association.


_My Dear Students and Friends_:--Accept my thanks
for your card of invitation, your badge, and order of exer-
cise, all of which are complete.

When I gave you a meagre reception in Boston at the [5]
close of the first convention of the National Christian
Scientist Association, it was simply to give you the privi-
lege, poor as it was, of speaking a few words aside to your
teacher. I remember my regret, when, having asked in
general assembly if you had any questions to propose, I [10]
received no reply. Since then you have doubtless realized
that such opportunity might have been improved; but
that time has passed.

I greatly rejoice over the growth of my students within
the last few years. It was kind of you to part so gently [15]
with the protecting wings of the mother-bird, and to spread
your own so bravely. Now, dear ones, if you take my
advice again, you will do--what?

Even this: Disorganize the National Christian Scientist
Association! and each one return to his place of [20]
labor, to work out individually and alone, for himself and
for others, the sublime ends of human life.
