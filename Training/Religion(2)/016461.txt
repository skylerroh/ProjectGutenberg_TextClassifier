INTRODUCTION

TO FIRST EDITION


The Bible is a Lamp to our feet and a light to our pathway. To know it
thoroughly is to be kept from stumbling, and to walk in the light is
fellowship with Him who is the heart of the Book.

The Bible is a Rock; to be familiar with its pages is to be established
in character, in hope and in faith, and while we may sometimes tremble,
the rock is immovable. The Bible is the true water of life. Mr. Moody
used to say that it comes down from on high and rises again in mighty
power to the throne on the principle that water seeks its own level. To
know the Bible is, therefore, to live a heavenly life and to be filled
with all the fullness of the spirit of Christ.

The author of this text book knows his Bible thoroughly and he has the
God-given ability of making it plain to others. What is here presented
he has worked out in the class room and in his own rich Christian
experience. I count it a privilege to write this line of introduction.
The members of the Young People's Societies in the churches, Christian
Associations, Bible study classes and Christian workers generally will
find it most helpful. A busy business man by means of it could think his
way through much of God's Word. It is a timely presentation of a great
subject. I am sure that God will bless it richly to all who attempt to
study it.

SEARCH Series of Bible Study Text Books

_"Be Ye Explorers of the Writings."_--JOHN 5:39

Teachers of the Scriptures are issuing many valuable aids to Bible
study. This series of text books is based upon the "Search" idea. We
believe this idea is fundamental. It is commended to the student public
for the following reasons:

_It is the Divine Method._

"_Seek_ ye out of the book of Jehovah" is the God-given command in
Isaiah 34:16 "Search ye the Scriptures" is the command of the God-man in
John 5:39. The God who wrote the Book and the God who knows man will
prescribe the best method by which man shall become acquainted with the
Book.

_It is the Pedagogic Method._

"What seest thou?" One basic pedagogic principle is to train the pupil's
physical and mental eyes to see things for himself. The first and
largest gate to knowledge is the _eye_ gate.

_It is the Scientific Method._

The scientist searches for facts. He hunts for facts in the stars, in
the rocks, in the plants, in the animals. From these facts he deduces
principles. "What saith the Scriptures?"

_It is the Interesting Method._

The search of the hunter, the explorer, the experimenter, the excavator,
the student, is a joyous labor. Every sense is alert There is no
drudgery, no fatigue. The "eureka" stirs a song of gladness. There is
much joy in bearing this testimony: "I have found Micah 6:8, or Isaiah
12, or Jeremiah 45:5, or Philippians 4:19," etc.

Now this is a Workable Method. The teacher can apply it. Give every
pupil a certain definite Search task. The teacher can adapt it to every
age, and to every degree of Biblical knowledge. This series of text
books will suggest plans of applying this basic method of Bible study in
becoming acquainted with the rich contents of the verses, the chapters,
the books of this most practical Word of God.




PREFACE TO THE BOOK


1. THE PURPOSE

This book is designed to be used in Bible Study Classes in churches, in
communities, in academies, in colleges. The author has endeavored to
furnish a text book of outlines and questions that shall unfold the
general contents of the Word of God. Its primary aim is to impart a
swift and comprehensive acquaintanceship with the material of the books
of the Bible.

2. THE CHARACTER OF THE WORK

It is not an exhaustive study. From its aim it could not be such. Some
of the sixty-six books are passed over in brief space, and some (chiefly
in the prophecies and epistles) are omitted altogether. It is a surface
study. The title so suggests. It does not enter into the deeper things.
It simply aims to lay bare the surface facts. It is expressly designed
to serve as a foundation for later detailed searching of the Word. It is
flexible. The teacher can add or subtract as time or local conditions
demand, and is earnestly exhorted so to do. One book may be omitted and
another added at the teacher's discretion. A part of the questions may
be omitted, or additional ones inserted. The outlines may be enlarged or
diminished or changed to suit the needs of the class according to the
teacher's personal judgment.

3. REQUISITES FOR STUDY

Let each scholar be provided with a cheap tablet, a well-bound blank
book of two hundred pages, a small Bible Dictionary of recognized
merit, and a copy of the American Revised Version of the Bible.
(Standard Edition of Nelson & Sons, 1901, bourgeois 8vo, is good.) The
teacher should provide for reference, to which the pupils should have
constant access, a copy of the Rand-McNally Bible Atlas, by J.L.
Hurlbut, D.D., a copy of Young's Complete Analytical Concordance, and a
copy of a large and complete Bible Dictionary.

4. SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS

To secure the best results the following plan, tested by experience, is
suggested: Let the assigned lesson be wrought out and recorded by the
pupil in the cheap tablet. At the next recitation let this recorded
lesson be read and corrected. At the following recitation this lesson
first assigned and corrected is to be recited from memory. So at each
recitation the following will be the general order: (1) The assigning of
the advance lesson. (2) The reading and correction of the lesson
assigned at the previous recitation. (3) The reciting from memory of the
lesson corrected at the previous recitation.

The work as soon as corrected is to be recorded by the scholar in the
blank book according to a simple set of rules. The following rules have
been used with good results:

DIRECTIONS FOR BIBLE BOOKS

1. Record each lesson the evening after its correction. (Commit the
work, as you record, for recital.)

2. Begin each large division at the top of the page.

3. Capitalize and underline all headings.

4. Leave a vacant line between small divisions.

5. Where questions are used, record both questions and answers.

6. The books will be graded substantially as follows:

Correctness of record, 35. (Includes spelling and grammar.)

Fullness of record, 35.

Neatness and care, 10.

Mechanical accuracy, 10.

Originality, 10.

It would be well to place a printed copy of these rules in the hands of
each student, to be pasted in the front of the blank book. These blank
books should be examined and graded every four or six weeks and should
constitute at least a third of the student's grade. The recording of the
work in the blank books may be omitted in the community or church
classes, at the option of the teacher. But the record of the work by
pencil in a cheap tablet _should be insisted upon as absolutely
necessary for the best results_. In the academy and college classes the
painstaking record in ink has been found by experience to be a most
valuable portion of the study.

Let the teacher review constantly. Drill the students, singly and
collectively, in the recitation material. Emphasize the avoidance of
mechanical study. Secure as much consecutive reading of the Word as
possible. Feed upon rich truths. Make practical and personal
applications of the Word. "All Scripture is profitable."

NOTES ON THE CHART

1. The sixty-six books are divided into ten groups, according to their
relation to the Kingdom. In this connection the word Kingdom is not used
in any restricted or technical sense. It is used to designate the
Kingdom of God instituted to redeem the race from sin, under whatever
form manifested.

2. Several of the books are not located in their exact places. Esther is
located in Division Six because it is Captivity narrative. The Kings and
Chronicles technically overlap two divisions. Lamentations and Jeremiah
chronologically belong to the preceding division, but are placed among
the books of the Captivity because their wails betoken that event.

3. The books in each division are arranged in chronological order. In
Division Nine the fourteen epistles of Paul are placed first, in the
order of their composition, then the seven general epistles in the order
of their writing.

4. Where the books of a division are separated into two groups by a
dash, those above the dash are historical, those beneath the dash are
biographical, or poetical, or legal, or prophetical, or epistolary.

5. The teacher may exercise his own judgment in requiring the committal
of this chart at the start, or part by part as the study proceeds.
