Sir 1:4
Wisdom hath been created before all things, and the
understanding of prudence from everlasting.

Sir 1:5
The word of God most high is the fountain of wisdom; and her
ways are everlasting commandments.

Sir 1:6
To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed? or who hath
known her wise counsels?

Sir 1:7
[Unto whom hath the knowledge of wisdom been made manifest?
and who hath understood her great experience?]

Sir 1:8
There is one wise and greatly to be feared, the Lord sitting
upon his throne.

Sir 1:9
He created her, and saw her, and numbered her, and poured her
out upon all his works.

Sir 1:10
She is with all flesh according to his gift, and he hath
given her to them that love him.

Sir 1:11
The fear of the Lord is honour, and glory, and gladness, and
a crown of rejoicing.

Sir 1:12
The fear of the Lord maketh a merry heart, and giveth joy,
and gladness, and a long life.

Sir 1:13
Whoso feareth the Lord, it shall go well with him at the
last, and he shall find favour in the day of his death.

Sir 1:14
To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and it was
created with the faithful in the womb.

Sir 1:15
She hath built an everlasting foundation with men, and she
shall continue with their seed.

Sir 1:16
To fear the Lord is fulness of wisdom, and filleth men with
her fruits.

Sir 1:17
She filleth all their house with things desirable, and the
garners with her increase.

Sir 1:18
The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, making peace and
perfect health to flourish; both which are the gifts of God: and
it enlargeth their rejoicing that love him.

Sir 1:19
Wisdom raineth down skill and knowledge of understanding
standing, and exalteth them to honour that hold her fast.

Sir 1:20
The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and the branches
thereof are long life.

Sir 1:21
The fear of the Lord driveth away sins: and where it is
present, it turneth away wrath.

Sir 1:22
A furious man cannot be justified; for the sway of his fury
shall be his destruction.

Sir 1:23
A patient man will tear for a time, and afterward joy shall
spring up unto him.

Sir 1:24
He will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shall
declare his wisdom.

Sir 1:25
The parables of knowledge are in the treasures of wisdom: but
godliness is an abomination to a sinner.

Sir 1:26
If thou desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord
shall give her unto thee.

Sir 1:27
For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction: and faith
and meekness are his delight.

Sir 1:28
Distrust not the fear of the Lord when thou art poor: and
come not unto him with a double heart.

Sir 1:29
Be not an hypocrite in the sight of men, and take good heed
what thou speakest.

Sir 1:30
Exalt not thyself, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour upon
thy soul, and so God discover thy secrets, and cast thee down in
the midst of the congregation, because thou camest not in truth
to the fear of the Lord, but thy heart is full of deceit.

Sir 2:1
My son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for
temptation.

Sir 2:2
Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and make not
haste in time of trouble.

Sir 2:3
Cleave unto him, and depart not away, that thou mayest be
increased at thy last end.

Sir 2:4
Whatsoever is brought upon thee take cheerfully, and be
patient when thou art changed to a low estate.

Sir 2:5
For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the
furnace of adversity.

Sir 2:6
Believe in him, and he will help thee; order thy way aright,
and trust in him.

Sir 2:7
Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; and go not aside,
lest ye fall.

Sir 2:8
Ye that fear the Lord, believe him; and your reward shall not
fail.

Sir 2:9
Ye that fear the Lord, hope for good, and for everlasting joy
and mercy.

Sir 2:10
Look at the generations of old, and see; did ever any trust
in the Lord, and was confounded? or did any abide in his fear,
and was forsaken? or whom did he ever despise, that called upon
him?

Sir 2:11
For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy, longsuffering,
and very pitiful, and forgiveth sins, and saveth in time of
affliction.

Sir 2:12
Woe be to fearful hearts, and faint hands, and the sinner
that goeth two ways!

Sir 2:13
Woe unto him that is fainthearted! for he believeth not;
therefore shall he not be defended.

Sir 2:14
Woe unto you that have lost patience! and what will ye do
when the Lord shall visit you?

Sir 2:15
They that fear the Lord will not disobey his Word; and they
that love him will keep his ways.

Sir 2:16
They that fear the Lord will seek that which is well,
pleasing unto him; and they that love him shall be filled with
the law.

Sir 2:17
They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, and humble
their souls in his sight,

Sir 2:18
Saying, We will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into
the hands of men: for as his majesty is, so is his mercy.

Sir 3:1
Hear me your father, O children, and do thereafter, that ye
may be safe.

Sir 3:2
For the Lord hath given the father honour over the children,
and hath confirmed the authority of the mother over the sons.

Sir 3:3
Whoso honoureth his father maketh an atonement for his sins:

Sir 3:4
And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up
treasure.

Sir 3:5
Whoso honoureth his father shall have joy of his own
children; and when he maketh his prayer, he shall be heard.

Sir 3:6
He that honoureth his father shall have a long life; and he
that is obedient unto the Lord shall be a comfort to his mother.

Sir 3:7
He that feareth the Lord will honour his father, and will do
service unto his parents, as to his masters.

Sir 3:8
Honour thy father and mother both in word and deed, that a
blessing may come upon thee from them.

Sir 3:9
For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses of
children; but the curse of the mother rooteth out foundations.

Sir 3:10
Glory not in the dishonour of thy father; for thy father's
dishonour is no glory unto thee.

Sir 3:11
For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father; and
a mother in dishonour is a reproach to the children.

Sir 3:12
My son, help thy father in his age, and grieve him not as
long as he liveth.

Sir 3:13
And if his understanding fail, have patience with him; and
despise him not when thou art in thy full strength.

Sir 3:14
For the relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten: and
instead of sins it shall be added to build thee up.

Sir 3:15
In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembered; thy
sins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather.

Sir 3:16
He that forsaketh his father is as a blasphemer; and he that
angereth his mother is cursed: of God.

Sir 3:17
My son, go on with thy business in meekness; so shalt thou be
beloved of him that is approved.

Sir 3:18
The greater thou art, the more humble thyself, and thou shalt
find favour before the Lord.

Sir 3:19
Many are in high place, and of renown: but mysteries are
revealed unto the meek.

Sir 3:20
For the power of the Lord is great, and he is honoured of the
lowly.

Sir 3:21
Seek not out things that are too hard for thee, neither
search the things that are above thy strength.

Sir 3:22
But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence,
for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things
that are in secret.

Sir 3:23
Be not curious in unnecessary matters: for more things are
shewed unto thee than men understand.

Sir 3:24
For many are deceived by their own vain opinion; and an evil
suspicion hath overthrown their judgment.

Sir 3:25
Without eyes thou shalt want light: profess not the knowledge
therefore that thou hast not.

Sir 3:26
A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that
loveth danger shall perish therein.

Sir 3:27
An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the
wicked man shall heap sin upon sin.

Sir 3:28
In the punishment of the proud there is no remedy; for the
plant of wickedness hath taken root in him.

Sir 3:29
The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; and an
attentive ear is the desire of a wise man.

Sir 3:30
Water will quench a flaming fire; and alms maketh an
atonement for sins.

Sir 3:31
And he that requiteth good turns is mindful of that which may
come hereafter; and when he falleth, he shall find a stay.

Sir 4:1
My son, defraud not the poor of his living, and make not the
needy eyes to wait long.

Sir 4:2
Make not an hungry soul sorrowful; neither provoke a man in
his distress.

Sir 4:3
Add not more trouble to an heart that is vexed; and defer not
to give to him that is in need.

Sir 4:4
Reject not the supplication of the afflicted; neither turn
away thy face from a poor man.

Sir 4:5
Turn not away thine eye from the needy, and give him none
occasion to curse thee:

Sir 4:6
For if he curse thee in the bitterness of his soul, his
prayer shall be heard of him that made him.

Sir 4:7
Get thyself the love of the congregation, and bow thy head to
a great man.

Sir 4:8
Let it not grieve thee to bow down thine ear to the poor, and
give him a friendly answer with meekness.

Sir 4:9
Deliver him that suffereth wrong from the hand of the
oppressor; and be not fainthearted when thou sittest in
judgment.

Sir 4:10
Be as a father unto the fatherless, and instead of an husband
unto their mother: so shalt thou be as the son of the most High,
and he shall love thee more than thy mother doth.

Sir 4:11
Wisdom exalteth her children, and layeth hold of them that
seek her.

Sir 4:12
He that loveth her loveth life; and they that seek to her
early shall be filled with joy.

Sir 4:13
He that holdeth her fast shall inherit glory; and wheresoever
she entereth, the Lord will bless.

Sir 4:14
They that serve her shall minister to the Holy One: and them
that love her the Lord doth love.

Sir 4:15
Whoso giveth ear unto her shall judge the nations: and he
that attendeth unto her shall dwell securely.

Sir 4:16
If a man commit himself unto her, he shall inherit her; and
his generation shall hold her in possession.

Sir 4:17
For at the first she will walk with him by crooked ways, and
bring fear and dread upon him, and torment him with her
discipline, until she may trust his soul, and try him by her
laws.

Sir 4:18
Then will she return the straight way unto him, and comfort
him, and shew him her secrets.

Sir 4:19
But if he go wrong, she will forsake him, and give him over
to his own ruin.

Sir 4:20
Observe the opportunity, and beware of evil; and be not
ashamed when it concerneth thy soul.

Sir 4:21
For there is a shame that bringeth sin; and there is a shame
which is glory and grace.

Sir 4:22
Accept no person against thy soul, and let not the reverence
of any man cause thee to fall.

Sir 4:23
And refrain not to speak, when there is occasion to do good,
and hide not thy wisdom in her beauty.

Sir 4:24
For by speech wisdom shall be known: and learning by the word
of the tongue.

Sir 4:25
In no wise speak against the truth; but be abashed of the
error of thine ignorance.

Sir 4:26
Be not ashamed to confess thy sins; and force not the course
of the river.

Sir 4:27
Make not thyself an underling to a foolish man; neither
accept the person of the mighty.

Sir 4:28
Strive for the truth unto death, and the Lord shall fight for
thee.

Sir 4:29
Be not hasty in thy tongue, and in thy deeds slack and
remiss.

Sir 4:30
Be not as a lion in thy house, nor frantick among thy
servants.

Sir 4:31
Let not thine hand be stretched out to receive, and shut when
thou shouldest repay.

Sir 5:1
Set thy heart upon thy goods; and say not, I have enough for
my life.

Sir 5:2
Follow not thine own mind and thy strength, to walk in the
ways of thy heart:

Sir 5:3
And say not, Who shall controul me for my works? for the Lord
will surely revenge thy pride.

Sir 5:4
Say not, I have sinned, and what harm hath happened unto me?
for the Lord is longsuffering, he will in no wise let thee go.

Sir 5:5
Concerning propitiation, be not without fear to add sin unto
sin:

Sir 5:6
And say not His mercy is great; he will be pacified for the
multitude of my sins: for mercy and wrath come from him, and his
indignation resteth upon sinners.

Sir 5:7
Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put not off from
day to day: for suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth,
and in thy security thou shalt be destroyed, and perish in the
day of vengeance.

Sir 5:8
Set not thine heart upon goods unjustly gotten, for they
shall not profit thee in the day of calamity.

Sir 5:9
Winnow not with every wind, and go not into every way: for so
doth the sinner that hath a double tongue.

Sir 5:10
Be stedfast in thy understanding; and let thy word be the
same.

Sir 5:11
Be swift to hear; and let thy life be sincere; and with
patience give answer.

Sir 5:12
If thou hast understanding, answer thy neighbour; if not, lay
thy hand upon thy mouth.

Sir 5:13
Honour and shame is in talk: and the tongue of man is his
fall.

Sir 5:14
Be not called a whisperer, and lie not in wait with thy
tongue: for a foul shame is upon the thief, and an evil
condemnation upon the double tongue.

Sir 5:15
Be not ignorant of any thing in a great matter or a small.

Sir 6:1
Instead of a friend become not an enemy; for [thereby] thou
shalt inherit an ill name, shame, and reproach: even so shall a
sinner that hath a double tongue.

Sir 6:2
Extol not thyself in the counsel of thine own heart; that thy
soul be not torn in pieces as a bull [straying alone.]

Sir 6:3
Thou shalt eat up thy leaves, and lose thy fruit, and leave
thyself as a dry tree.

Sir 6:4
A wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it, and shall make
him to be laughed to scorn of his enemies.

Sir 6:5
Sweet language will multiply friends: and a fairspeaking
tongue will increase kind greetings.

Sir 6:6
Be in peace with many: nevertheless have but one counsellor
of a thousand.

Sir 6:7
If thou wouldest get a friend, prove him first and be not
hasty to credit him.

Sir 6:8
For some man is a friend for his own occasion, and will not
abide in the day of thy trouble.

Sir 6:9
And there is a friend, who being turned to enmity, and strife
will discover thy reproach.

Sir 6:10
Again, some friend is a companion at the table, and will not
continue in the day of thy affliction.

Sir 6:11
But in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, and will be bold
over thy servants.

Sir 6:12
If thou be brought low, he will be against thee, and will
hide himself from thy face.

Sir 6:13
Separate thyself from thine enemies, and take heed of thy
friends.

Sir 6:14
A faithfull friend is a strong defence: and he that hath
found such an one hath found a treasure.

Sir 6:15
Nothing doth countervail a faithful friend, and his
excellency is invaluable.

Sir 6:16
A faithful friend is the medicine of life; and they that fear
the Lord shall find him.

Sir 6:17
Whoso feareth the Lord shall direct his friendship aright:
for as he is, so shall his neighbour be also.

Sir 6:18
My son, gather instruction from thy youth up: so shalt thou
find wisdom till thine old age.

Sir 6:19
Come unto her as one that ploweth and soweth, and wait for
her good fruits: for thou shalt not toil much in labouring about
her, but thou shalt eat of her fruits right soon.

Sir 6:20
She is very unpleasant to the unlearned: he that is without
understanding will not remain with her.

Sir 6:21
She will lie upon him as a mighty stone of trial; and he will
cast her from him ere it be long.

Sir 6:22
For wisdom is according to her name, and she is not manifest
unto many.

Sir 6:23
Give ear, my son, receive my advice, and refuse not my
counsel,

Sir 6:24
And put thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into her
chain.

Sir 6:25
Bow down thy shoulder, and bear her, and be not grieved with
her bonds.

Sir 6:26
Come unto her with thy whole heart, and keep her ways with
all thy power.

Sir 6:27
Search, and seek, and she shall be made known unto thee: and
when thou hast got hold of her, let her not go.

Sir 6:28
For at the last thou shalt find her rest, and that shall be
turned to thy joy.

Sir 6:29
Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and her
chains a robe of glory.

Sir 6:30
For there is a golden ornament upon her, and her bands are
purple lace.

Sir 6:31
Thou shalt put her on as a robe of honour, and shalt put her
about thee as a crown of joy.

Sir 6:32
My son, if thou wilt, thou shalt be taught: and if thou wilt
apply thy mind, thou shalt be prudent.

Sir 6:33
If thou love to hear, thou shalt receive understanding: and
if thou bow thine ear, thou shalt be wise,

Sir 6:34
Stand in the multitude of the elders; and cleave unto him
that is wise.

Sir 6:35
Be willing to hear every godly discourse; and let not the
parables of understanding escape thee.

Sir 6:36
And if thou seest a man of understanding, get thee betimes
unto him, and let thy foot wear the steps of his door.

Sir 6:37
Let thy mind be upon the ordinances of the Lord and meditate
continually in his commandments: he shall establish thine heart,
and give thee wisdom at thine owns desire.

Sir 7:1
Do no evil, so shall no harm come unto thee.

Sir 7:2
Depart from the unjust, and iniquity shall turn away from
thee.

Sir 7:3
My son, sow not upon the furrows of unrighteousness, and thou
shalt not reap them sevenfold.

Sir 7:4
Seek not of the Lord preeminence, neither of the king the
seat of honour.

Sir 7:5
justify not thyself before the Lord; and boast not of thy
wisdom before the king.

Sir 7:6
Seek not to be judge, being not able to take away iniquity;
lest at any time thou fear the person of the mighty, an
stumblingblock in the way of thy uprightness.

Sir 7:7
Offend not against the multitude of a city, and then thou
shalt not cast thyself down among the people.

Sir 7:8
Bind not one sin upon another; for in one thou shalt not be
unpunished.

Sir 7:9
Say not, God will look upon the multitude of my oblations,
and when I offer to the most high God, he will accept it.

Sir 7:10
Be not fainthearted when thou makest thy prayer, and neglect
not to give alms.

Sir 7:11
Laugh no man to scorn in the bitterness of his soul: for
there is one which humbleth and exalteth.

Sir 7:12
Devise not a lie against thy brother; neither do the like to
thy friend.

Sir 7:13
Use not to make any manner of lie: for the custom thereof is
not good.

Sir 7:14
Use not many words in a multitude of elders, and make not
much babbling when thou prayest.

Sir 7:15
Hate not laborious work, neither husbandry, which the most
High hath ordained.

Sir 7:16
Number not thyself among the multitude of sinners, but
remember that wrath will not tarry long.

Sir 7:17
Humble thyself greatly: for the vengeance of the ungodly is
fire and worms.

Sir 7:18
Change not a friend for any good by no means; neither a
faithful brother for the gold of Ophir.

Sir 7:19
Forego not a wise and good woman: for her grace is above
gold.

Sir 7:20
Whereas thy servant worketh truly, entreat him not evil, nor
the hireling that bestoweth himself wholly for thee.

Sir 7:21
Let thy soul love a good servant, and defraud him not of
liberty.

Sir 7:22
Hast thou cattle? have an eye to them: and if they be for thy
profit, keep them with thee.

Sir 7:23
Hast thou children? instruct them, and bow down their neck
from their youth.

Sir 7:24
Hast thou daughters? have a care of their body, and shew not
thyself cheerful toward them.

Sir 7:25
Marry thy daughter, and so shalt thou have performed a
weighty matter: but give her to a man of understanding.

Sir 7:26
Hast thou a wife after thy mind? forsake her not: but give
not thyself over to a light woman.

Sir 7:27
Honour thy father with thy whole heart, and forget not the
sorrows of thy mother.

Sir 7:28
Remember that thou wast begotten of them; and how canst thou
recompense them the things that they have done for thee?

Sir 7:29
Fear the Lord with all thy soul, and reverence his priests.

Sir 7:30
Love him that made thee with all thy strength, and forsake
not his ministers.

Sir 7:31
Fear the Lord, and honor the priest; and give him his
portion, as it is commanded thee; the firstfruits, and the
trespass offering, and the gift of the shoulders, and the
sacrifice of sanctification, and the firstfruits of the holy
things.

Sir 7:32
And stretch thine hand unto the poor, that thy blessing may
be perfected.

Sir 7:33
A gift hath grace in the sight of every man living; and for
the dead detain it not.

Sir 7:34
Fail not to be with them that weep, and mourn with them that
mourn.

Sir 7:35
Be not slow to visit the sick: for that shall make thee to be
beloved.

Sir 7:36
Whatsoever thou takest in hand, remember the end, and thou
shalt never do amiss.

Sir 8:1
Strive not with a mighty man' lest thou fall into his hands.

Sir 8:2
Be not at variance with a rich man, lest he overweigh thee:
for gold hath destroyed many, and perverted the hearts of kings.

Sir 8:3
Strive not with a man that is full of tongue, and heap not
wood upon his fire.

Sir 8:4
Jest not with a rude man, lest thy ancestors be disgraced.

Sir 8:5
Reproach not a man that turneth from sin, but remember that
we are all worthy of punishment.

Sir 8:6
Dishonour not a man in his old age: for even some of us wax
old.

Sir 8:7
Rejoice not over thy greatest enemy being dead, but remember
that we die all.

Sir 8:8
Despise not the discourse of the wise, but acquaint thyself
with their proverbs: for of them thou shalt learn instruction,
and how to serve great men with ease.

Sir 8:9
Miss not the discourse of the elders: for they also learned
of their fathers, and of them thou shalt learn understanding,
and to give answer as need requireth.

Sir 8:10
Kindle not the coals of a sinner, lest thou be burnt with the
flame of his fire.

Sir 8:11
Rise not up [in anger] at the presence of an injurious
person, lest he lie in wait to entrap thee in thy words

Sir 8:12
Lend not unto him that is mightier than thyself; for if thou
lendest him, count it but lost.

Sir 8:13
Be not surety above thy power: for if thou be surety, take
care to pay it.

Sir 8:14
Go not to law with a judge; for they will judge for him
according to his honour.

Sir 8:15
Travel not by the way with a bold fellow, lest he become
grievous unto thee: for he will do according to his own will,
and thou shalt perish with him through his folly.

Sir 8:16
Strive not with an angry man, and go not with him into a
solitary place: for blood is as nothing in his sight, and where
there is no help, he will overthrow thee.

Sir 8:17
Consult not with a fool; for he cannot keep counsel.

Sir 8:18
Do no secret thing before a stranger; for thou knowest not
what he will bring forth.

Sir 8:19
Open not thine heart to every man, lest he requite thee with
a shrewd turn.

Sir 9:1
Be not jealous over the wife of thy bosom, and teach her not
an evil lesson against thyself.

Sir 9:2
Give not thy soul unto a woman to set her foot upon thy
substance.

Sir 9:3
Meet not with an harlot, lest thou fall into her snares.

Sir 9:4
Use not much the company of a woman that is a singer, lest
thou be taken with her attempts.
