Hark! A Mystic Voice is Sounding
En clara vox

Tr. Rev. E. Caswall
Nicola A. Montani

Moderato

1.
Hark! A mystic voice is sounding,
"Christ is nigh," it seems to say.
"Cast away the dreams of darkness,
O ye children of the day."
Startled at the solemn warning,
Let the earth-bound soul arise;
Christ, her Sun, all sloth dispelling,
Shines upon the morning skies.

2.
Lo! the lamb so long expected,
Comes with pardon down from Heav'n,
Let us haste, with tears of sorrow,
One and all to be forgiv'n.
So when next He comes with glory,
Wrapping all the earth in fear,
May He then as our Defender,
On the clouds of Heav'n appear.

1.
O come, O come, Emmanuel,
And ransom captive Israel,
That mourns in lonely exile here,
Until the Son of God appear.

Chorus
Rejoice! Rejoice! O Israel!
To thee shall come Emmanuel.

2.
O come Thou Rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan's tyranny;
From depths of hell thy people save,
And give them vict'ry o'er the grave.

3.
O come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer
Our spirits by thine Advent here,
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night,
And death's dark shadows put to flight.

4.
O come, O come, Thou Lord of Might,
Who to Thy tribes on Sinai's height,
In ancient times didst give the law,
In cloud, and majesty and awe.

Behold! behold He cometh

Processional
Translated from the Latin

Moderato

Behold! behold He cometh,
Who doth salvation bring;
Lift up your heads rejoicing,
And welcome Zion's King;
With Hymns of joy we praise the Lord,
Hosanna to th' Incarnate Word!

Hosanna to the Saviour,
Who came on Christmas morn,
And, of a lowly Virgin,
Was in a stable born;
Emmanuel! Dear Jesus, come,
Within Thy children make Thy home!

Yea, come in love and meekness,
Our Saviour now to be;
Come to be formed in us,
And make us like to Thee,
Before the Day of Wrath draw near,
When as our Judge Thou shalt appear.

Soon shalt Thou sit in glory
Upon the great White Throne,
And punish all the wicked,
And recompense Thine own;
When ev'ry word and deed and thought
To righteous judgement shall be brought.

The anthem of gladness and

With their songs unending,
All-joyful, dear Jesus, Thy

See, amid the winter's snow

Rev. E. Caswall
Traditional Melody

Allegretto
1.
See, amid the winter's snow,
Born to us on earth below;
See the tender lamb appears,
Promised from eternal years.

Chorus
Hail, thou ever blessed morn,
Hail, Redemption's happy dawn!
Sing through all Jerusalem,
Christ is born in Bethlehem.

2.
Lo, within a manger lies
He who built the starry skies;
He, who throned in heights sublime,
Sits amid the Cherubim.

3.
Sacred Infant all divine,
What a tender love was Thine;
Thus to come from highest bliss,
Down to such a world as this.

4.
Teach, oh teach us, holy Child,
By Thy Face so meek and mild;
Teach us to resemble Thee
In Thy sweet humility.

5.
Virgin Mother, Mary blest
By the joys the fill thy breast,
Pray for us, that we may prove
Worthy of the Saviour's love.

O Dear Little Children

Carol
Translated by Sister Jeanne Marie
Traditional Melody
Arr. By N. A. M.

Moderato semplice

1.
O dear little children, O come one and all,
Draw near to the crib, here in Bethlehem's stall,
And see what a bright ray of heaven's delight
Our Father has sent on this thrice holy night.

2.
O see in the crib low concealing His might,
See here by the rays of the clear shining light,
In cleanliest swaddle the Heavenly Child
More beauteous than legions of hosts undefiled.

3.
He lies there, O children, on hay and on straw
Dear Mary and Joseph regard Him with awe,
The shepherds, adoring, bow humbly in pray'r,
Angelical choirs with song rend the air.

4.
O children bend low and adore Him today,
O lift up your hands like the shepherds and pray,
Sing joyfully, children, with hearts full of love
In jubilant song join the angels above.

Angels we have heard on high

Bishop Chadwick
Nicola. A. Montani

Allegro moderato

1.
Angels we have heard on high,
Sweetly singing o'er the plains,
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains.

2.
Shepherd, why this jubilee?
Why your rapturous strains prolong?
What may the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heav'nly song?

3.
Come to Bethlehem, and see
Him Whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

4.
See Him in a manger laid,
Whom the choirs of angels praise
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
While our hearts in love we raise.

The snow lay on the ground
Old English Carol

Rev. Dr. Lingard
Edv. Grieg
Arr. By N. A. M.

Non troppo lento

1.
The snow lay on the ground, the stars shone bright
When Christ our Lord was born on Christmas night.

2.
'Twas Mary, daughter pure of holy Anne,
That brought into this world the God made Man.

3.
She laid Him in the stall at Bethlehem;
The ass and oxen shared the roof with him.

4.
Saint Joseph to was by, to tend the Child;
To guard Him, and protect His Mother mild.

5.
The angels hovered 'round, and sang this song;
"Venite, adoremus Dominum."

6.
And then that manger poor became a throne;
For He whom Mary bore was God the Son.

7.
O come then, let us join the heav'nly host,
To praise the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

Stars of Glory

Carol
Dr. Husenbeth
S. Janowska

Slowly

1.
Stars of glory, shine more brightly,
Purer be the moonlight's beam,
Glide, ye hours and moments, lightly,
Swiftly down time's deepening stream;
Bring the hour that banished sadness
Brought redemption down to earth;
When the shepherds heard with gladness
Tidings of the Saviour's birth.

2.
See a beauteous angel soaring
In the bright celestial blaze,
On the shepherds, low adoring
Rest his mild effulgent rays;
"Fear not," cries the heav'nly stranger,
"Him Whom ancient seers foretold,
Weeping in a lowly manger
Shepherds, haste ye to behold."

3.
See the shepherd quickly rising,
Hast'ning to the humble stall,
And the newborn Infant prizing,
As the mighty Lord of all;
Lowly now they bend before Him
In His helpless infant state,
Firmly faithful, they adore Him,
And His greatness celebrate.

4.
Hark! The swell of heav'nly voices
Peals along the vaulted sky;
Angels sing while earth rejoices
"Glory to our God on high;
Glory in the highest heaven,
Peace to humble men on earth;"
Joy to these and bliss is given
In the great Redeemer's birth.

O Sing a joyous carol

Sister M. B.
from "Alte Katholische geistliche Kirchengesang" (Koln, 1599)*

* Catholic melody incorrectly attributed to M. Praetorius

Joyously

1.
O sing a joyful carol
Unto the holy Child,
And praise with gladsome voices
His Mother undefiled.
Our gladsome voices greeting
Shall hail our Infant King
And our sweet Lady listens
When joyful voices sing.

2.
Who is there meekly lying
In yonder stable poor?
Dear children, it is Jesus;
He bids you now adore.
Who is there kneeling by Him
In Virgin beauty fair?
It is our Mother Mary,
She bids you all draw near.

3.
Who is there near the cradle,
That guards the holy Child?
It is our father Joseph
Chaste spouse of Mary mild.
Dear children, oh, how joyful
With them in Heav'n to be!
God grant that none be missing
From that festivity.
