_The Abiding Friend._

I have found a friend in Jesus, he's everything to me,
  He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;
The Lily of the Valley, in him alone I see
  All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole.
In sorrow he's my comfort, in trouble he's my stay,
  He tells me ev'ry care on him to roll.
He's the Lily of the Valley, the bright and Morning Star,
  He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

2 He all my griefs has taken, and all my sorrows borne;
  In temptation he's my strong and mighty tower;
I have all for him forsaken, and all my idols torn
  From my heart, and now he keeps me by his power.
Tho' all the world forsake me, and Satan tempt me sore,
  Thro' Jesus I shall safely reach the goal.
He's the Lily of the Valley, the bright and Morning Star,
  He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

3 He will never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here,
  While I live by faith and do his blessed will;
A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear,
  With his manna he my hungry soul shall fill.
Then sweeping up to glory to see his blessed face,
  Where rivers of delight shall ever roll.
He's the Lily of the Valley, the bright and Morning Star,
  He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.


329     Glory to His Name. P.M.

_Praise to Christ._

Down at the cross where my Savior died.
  Down where for cleansing from sin I cried;
There to my heart was the blood applied;
  Glory to his name.

Cho.--Glory to his name,
      Glory to his name,
      There to my heart was the blood applied,
      Glory to his name.

2 I am so wondrously saved from sin,
  Jesus so sweetly abides within;
There at the cross where he took me in;
  Glory to his name.

3 Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin,
  I am so glad, I have entered in;
There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;
  Glory to his name.

4 Come to this fountain, so rich and sweet,
  Cast thy poor soul at the Savior's feet;
Plunge in to-day and be made complete;
  Glory to his name.

_Lamenting the Absence of the Spirit._     (625)

Oh, for a closer walk with God!
  A calm and heavenly frame!
A light to shine upon the road
  That leads me to the Lamb!

2 Where is the blessedness I knew
  When first I saw the Lord?
Where is the soul-refreshing view
  Of Jesus and his word?

3 What peaceful hours I then enjoyed!
  How sweet their memory still!
But now I find an aching void
  The world can never fill.

4 Return, oh, holy Dove, return,
  Sweet messenger of rest;
I hate the sins that made thee mourn,
  And drove thee from, my breast.

5 The dearest idol I have known,
  Whatever that idol be,
Help me to tear it from thy throne,
  And worship only thee.

6 So shall my walk be close with God,
  Calm and serene my frame;
So purer light shall mark the road
  That leads me to the Lamb.

     W. Cowper, 1772.

_A Perfect Heart._     (645)

Oh, for a heart to praise my God,
  A heart from sin set free--
A heart that always feels thy blood,
  So freely spilt for me;--

2 A heart resigned, submissive, meek,
  My great Redeemer's throne,
Where only Christ is heard to speak,
  Where Jesus reigns alone.

3 Oh, for a lowly, contrite heart,
  Believing, true, and clean,
Which neither life nor death can part
  From him that dwells within;--

4 A heart in every thought renewed,
  And full of love divine;
Perfect, and right, and pure, and good,
  A copy, Lord, of thine.

5 Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;
  Come quickly from above;
Write thy new name upon my heart--
  Thy new, best name of Love.

     Charles Wesley. 1742.

_Triumphant Grace._     (847)

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,
  That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
  Was blind, but now I see.

2 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
  And grace my fears relieved:
How precious did that grace appear,
  The hour I first believed!

3 Through many dangers, toils, and snares
  I have already come;
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
  And grace will lead me home.

4 The Lord has promised good to me,
  His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be,
  As long as life endures.


333     Evan. C.M.

_The Peace of God._     (725)

We bless thee for thy peace, O God
  Deep as the soundless sea,
Which falls like sunshine on the road
  Of those who trust in thee.

2 That peace which suffers and is strong,
  Trusts where it cannot see,
Deems not the trial way too long,
  But leaves the end with thee;--

3 That peace which flows serene and deep,
  A river in the soul,
Whose banks a living verdure keep;
  God's sunshine o'er the whole.

4 Such, Father! give our hearts such peace,
  Whate'er the outward be,
Till all life's discipline shall cease,
  And we go home to thee.

     Anon. 1862.

_The Voice of Jesus._     (666)

I heard the voice of Jesus say,
  "Come unto me and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
  Thy head upon my breast."

2 I came to Jesus as I was,
  Weary, and worn, and sad;
I found in him a resting-place,
  And he has made me glad.

3 I heard the voice of Jesus say
  "Behold! I freely give
The living water; thirsty one!
  Stoop down, and drink, and live."

4 I came to Jesus, and I drank
  Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
  And now I live in him.

5 I heard the voice of Jesus say,
  "I am this dark world's Light;
Look unto me; thy morn shall rise,
  And all thy day be bright."

6 I looked to Jesus, and I found,
  In him my Star, my Sun;
And, in that light of life, I'll walk
  Till traveling days are done.

     Horatius Bonar, 1857.

_The Lord's Guardianship._     (855)

How gentle God's commands!
  How kind his precepts are!
Come, cast your burdens on the Lord,
  And trust his constant care.

2 His bounty will provide;
  His saints securely dwell;
That hand which bears creation up,
  Shall guard his children well.

3 Why should this anxious load
  Press down your weary mind?
Oh, seek your heavenly Father's throne,
  And peace and comfort find.

4 His Goodness Stands approved,
  Unchanged from day to day;
I'll drop my burden at his feet,
  And bear a song away.

     Philip Doddridge, 1740.


336     Dennis. S.M.

_Grace.--Eph. 2:8._     (744)

Grace! 'tis a charming sound
  Harmonious to the ear!
Heaven with the echo shall resound,
  And all the earth shall hear.

2 Grace first contrived a way
  To save rebellious man;
And all the steps that grace display,
  Which drew the wondrous plan.

3 Grace led my roving feet
  To tread the heavenly road;
And new supplies each hour I meet
  While pressing on to God.

4 Grace all the work shall crown,
  Through everlasting days;
It lays in heaven the topmost stone;
  And well deserves the praise.

     Philip Doddridge, 1755.

_Adoption.--I. John 3:1-3._     (742)

Behold what wondrous grace
  The Father has bestowed
On sinners of a mortal race,
  To call them sons of God!

2 Nor doth it yet appear
  How great we must be made;
But when we see our Savior there,
  We shall be like our Head.

3 A hope so much divine
  May trials well endure,
May purge our souls from sense and sin,
  As Christ the Lord is pure.

4 If in my Father's love
  I share a filial part,
Send down thy Spirit, like a dove,
  To rest upon my heart.

5 We would no longer lie
  Like slaves beneath the throne;
Our faith shall Abba, Father! cry
  And thou the kindred own.

     Isaac Watts, 1707.

_Memorial of Praise._     (617)

Come, thou Fount of ev'ry blessing,
  Tune my heart to sing thy grace;
Streams of mercy never ceasing,
  Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
  Sung by flaming tongues above;
Praise the mount--I'm fixed upon it,
  Mount of thy redeeming love.

2 Here I'll raise mine Ebenezer,
  Hither by thy help I'm come;
And I hope by thy good pleasure,
  Safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
  Wand'ring from the fold of God,
He, to rescue me from danger,
  Interposed his precious blood.

3 Oh! to grace how great a debtor
  Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
  Bind my wand'ring heart to thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;
  Prone to leave the God I love--
Here's my heart, oh, take and seal it;
  Seal it for thy courts above.

     Robert Robinson, 1758.

_The Lord's Pity._     (188)

The pity of the Lord,
  To those that fear his name,
Is such as tender parents feel;
  He knows our feeble frame.

2 He knows we are but dust,
  Scattered with ev'ry breath;
His anger, like a rising wind,
  Can send us swift to death.

3 Our days are as the grass,
  Or like the morning flow'r;
If one sharp blast sweep o'er the field,
  It withers in an hour.

4 But thy compassions, Lord,
  To endless years endure;
And children's children ever find
  Thy words of promise sure.

     Isaac Watts. 1719.


340     Refuge. 7s. D.

_The Only Refuge._     (532)

Jesus, Lover of my soul,
  Let me to thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
  While the tempest still is high!
Hide me, O my Savior, hide,
  Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide,
  O receive my soul at last!

2 Other refuge have I none;
  Hangs my helpless soul on thee:
Leave, O, leave me not alone,
  Still support and comfort me:
All my trust on thee is stayed,
  All my help from thee I bring;
Cover my defenseless head
  With the shadow of thy wing!

3 Thou, O Christ, art all I want;
  More than all in thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
  Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
Just and holy is thy name,
  I am all unrighteousness:
False and full of sin I am,
  Thou art full of truth and grace.

4 Plenteous grace with thee is found,
  Grace to cover all my sin:
Let the healing streams abound:
  Make and keep me pure within.
Thou of life the fountain art,
  Freely let me take of thee:
Spring thou up within my heart,
  Rise to all eternity.

     Charles Wesley, 1740.

_Savior, Pilot Me._

Jesus, Savior, pilot me,
Over life's tempestuous sea;
Unknown waves before me roll,
Hiding rock and treach'rous shoal;
Chart and compass come from thee;
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

2 As a mother stills her child,
Thou canst hush the ocean wild;
Boist'rous waves obey thy will,
When thou say'st to them "Be still!"
Wondrous Sov'reign of the sea,
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

3 When at last I near the shore,
And the fearful breakers roar
'Twixt me and the peaceful rest,
Then, while leaning on thy breast,
May I hear thee say to me,
"Fear not, I will pilot thee!"

     Rev. Edward Hopper


342     Fulton. 7s.

     (577)

Savior! teach me, day by day,
Love's sweet lesson to obey;
Sweeter lesson cannot be,
Loving him who first loved me.

2 With a child-like heart of love,
At thy bidding may I move;
Prompt to serve and follow thee,
Loving him who first loved me.

3 Teach me all thy steps to trace,
Strong to follow in thy grace;
Learning how to love from thee,
Loving him who first loved me.

4 Love in loving finds employ--
In obedience all her joy;
Ever new that joy will be,
Loving him who first loved me.

_Contentment.--Phil. 4:11._     (730)

O Lord, how full of sweet content
Our years of pilgrimage are spent!
Where'er we dwell, we dwell with thee,
In heaven, in earth, or on the sea.

2 To us remains nor place nor time;
Our country is in every clime:
We can be calm and free from care
On any shore, since God is there.

3 While place we seek, or place we shun,
The soul finds happiness in none;
But with our God to guide our way,
'Tis equal joy to go or stay.

4 Could we be cast where thou art not,
That were indeed a dreadful lot;
But regions none remote we call,
Secure of finding God in all.

_Completeness.--Col. 2:10._     (730)

Complete in thee! no work of mine
May take, dear Lord, the place of thine;
Thy blood has pardon bought for me,
And I am now complete in thee.

2 Complete in thee--no more shall sin
Thy grace has conquered, reign within;
Thy voice will bid the tempter flee,
And I shall stand complete in thee.

3 Complete in thee--each want supplied,
And no good thing to me denied,
Since thou my portion, Lord, wilt be,
I ask no more--complete in thee.

4 Dear Savior! when before thy bar
All tribes and tongues assembled are.
Among thy chosen may I be
At thy right hand--complete in thee.

_Safe in Jesus._     (696)

In heavenly love abiding,
  No change my heart shall fear,
And safe is such confiding,
  For nothing changes here,
The storm may roar without me,
  My heart may low be laid,
But God is round about me,--
  And can I be dismayed?

2 Wherever he may guide me,
  No want shall turn me back:
My Shepherd is beside me,
  And nothing can I lack;
His wisdom ever waketh,
  His sight is never dim,
He knows the way he taketh,
  And I will walk with him.

3 Green pastures are before me,
  Which yet I have not seen;
Bright skies will soon be o'er me,
  Where darkest clouds have been;
My hope I cannot measure,
  My path to life is free;
My Savior has my treasure,
  And he will walk with me.

_Light After Darkness._

Sometimes a light surprises
  The Christian while he sings:
It is the Lord who rises
  With healing on his wings;
When comforts are declining,
  He grants the soul again
A season of clear shining,
  To cheer it after rain.

2 In holy contemplation,
  We sweetly then pursue
The theme of God's salvation,
  And find it ever new:
Set free from present sorrow,
  We cheerfully can say,
Let the unknown to-morrow
  Bring with it what it may.

     Wm. Cowper.
