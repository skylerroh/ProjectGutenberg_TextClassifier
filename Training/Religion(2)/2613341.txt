And all in heaven.

In this delightful work engage;
Old men and babes in Sion sing
The growing glories of her King.

Let the whole earth his glory sing
Who made our peace with heaven.


Hymn 3:45. As the 148th Psalm.

1 Hosanna to the King
Of David's ancient blood;
Behold he comes to bring
Forgiving grace from God:
Let old and young
Attend his way,
And at his feet
Their honours lay.

2 Glory to God on high,
Salvation to the Lamb;
Let earth, and sea, and sky
His wondrous love proclaim:
Upon his head
Shall honours rest,
And every age
Pronounce him blest.
