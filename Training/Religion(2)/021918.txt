PREFACE.


The immediate incentive to this undertaking was, a knowledge, or at
least a strong impression, that a connected and explanatory
translation of the rules of jurisprudence[1] in the Dharma Sastra
of Yajnavalkya was a practical want.

Such impression was coincided in, and therefore proved correct, by a
long list of local subscribers eminently qualified, by position and
experience, to decide.

Dr. Roeer is responsible for the fidelity of the rendering, so far as
depends on knowledge of the Sanscrit language and literature, of Hindu
mythology and philosophy. Mr. Montriou has aided, so far as enabled by
juridical acquirements and experience. The language of translation
has, therefore, been a joint labour, often the result of much and
anxious discussion, and, if not unfrequently but a choice of doubtful
alternatives, yet, always a choice made with pains and circumspection.

The text we have generally followed is Stenzler's[2] which is based on
and selected from two MSS. in the royal library at Berlin and two
editions published in Calcutta.[3]

We have not neglected constant comparison with Stenzler's German
translation as well as with the several detached passages as
translated by Colebrooke and W. Macnaghten.

Words within brackets ( [ ] ) are not in the original text.

References to, and extracts from, the standard commentary upon
Yajnavalkya, the Mitakshara, necessarily form the staple of our notes.
All such extracts are distinguished by the initial (_M._), and the
author of the commentary we invariably refer to as, the Commentator.

At the same time, we have not blindly or implicitly followed this
commentator. In some sense all Hindu glosses are untrustworthy guides.
They assume the text to be the language of inspiration; and, as the
several Dharma Sastras not merely differ, but often dispose of the
same subject in a contradictory manner, Pandits deem it their duty to
reconcile all discrepancies, how forced soever their interpretations
may be. In passages so dealt with, we have endeavoured to give the
plain meaning of the original text.

We gratefully acknowledge the obliging assistance, in research,
enquiry, and suggestion, occasionally afforded, in the progress of
our task, by Babus, Chandra Saikhur Dev[4] and Shyamacharana
Sircar.[5]

Of the above list, twenty (distinguished by one cross) are in
Yajnavalkya's list:[7] seventeen of these are named by Parasara,
_viz._ all except Yama, Brihaspati and Vyasa, instead of whom he gives
Kasyapa, Gargya and Prachetas: the _Padma Purana_ gives those
named by Yajnavalkya, with the exception of Atri, and seventeen
others, (distinguished by two crosses) three of whom, Prachetas,
Kasyapa and Gargya, are on Parasara's list, and the remaining
fourteen, not before mentioned: Madhusudana Saraswati names the same
nineteen of Yajnavalkya's list, also Devala, Narada, Paithinasi:
Rama Krishna, in his gloss to the _Grihya Sutras_ of Paraskara,
mentions thirty-nine, of whom nine (distinguished by three crosses)
are new ones. There is also a Dharma Sastra attributed to Sankha
and Likhita jointly, thus making forty-seven in the whole. The
professor considers all to be extant; and has himself met with
quotations from all, except Agni, Kuthumi, Budha, Satyayana, and
Soma.

To those may be added several recensions of the same Dharma
Sastras, of which professor Stenzler speaks to having read of
twenty-two.

The entire forty-seven are independent sources of and authorities upon
Hindu law.

The Digest of Jagannat'ha Tarcapanchanana, as translated by
Colebrooke, is a valuable repertory of texts; but, detached and
isolated as they necessarily are, those texts can with difficulty be
appreciated or applied.

Yajnavalkya is second in importance to Manu alone: and, with the
commentary, is the leading authority of the Mithila school.

The resident of British India needs not to be informed, that the
orthodox Hindu regards his Dharma Sastras as direct revelations of
the Divine will: still less need such an one be told, that, among this
people, law is entirely subservient to the mysterious despotism of
cast,[8] a religious, rather than a political ordinance.

With the Hindu, all religious tenets and aspirations are centred in
the idea of BRAHMA, the one, pervading, illimitable substance, without
multiple, division or repetition. This idea has two modes or phases,
1st. as representing the absolute, self-included Brahma; 2nd. as
representing Brahma in connection with, relative to, the world. In the
latter, Brahma is creator of the world, or, the very world, a
semblance or a development of the former, the absolute idea. Man's
highest aspiration and aim is, to know Brahma absolutely: to have
attained this knowledge implies a total renunciation of worldly
concerns, to coalesce with, to be ultimately absorbed in, reunited
with, Brahma. Brahmanas are held to possess, to represent, this
knowledge. Again, Brahma is the creator, the preserver, also, the
objects created and preserved. Kshattriyas represent Brahma, the
preserver: Vaisyas, Brahma the preserved. The dogma is otherwise
explained: in the secondary or relative notion, Brahma is _Sattwa_,
_Rajas_, _Tamas_, _i. e._ goodness, activity, darkness,--respectively
represented by the Brahmana, Kshattriya, and Vaisya casts.

When the Hindus dwelt in the country of the five rivers, and were
worshippers of the powers and phenomena of material Nature, as of
Indra, Vayu, Agni &c., cast was necessarily unknown, for the notion of
Brahma was undeveloped.

The divisions or classes among them were conventional; there were
princes, priests, and peasants or cultivators.

But class distinction had not then crystallized into cast, into
immiscible, uncongenial yet co-ordinate elements of a so called
revealed constitution.

So soon however as the idea of Brahma had attained fixity in the Hindu
mind, and simultaneously with it, cast was developed, as we find it
(but imperfectly) in the earliest records of Hindu philosophy, the
Upanishads.

Thus, cast governs and is antecedent to law, which must bend and adapt
itself to cast, as the overruling, intrinsic, unalterable condition of
Hinduism, of Hindu life. There is one law, one phase of obligation for
the twice-born, another for the Sudra. In Manu, cast is not so
fully and severely developed: Manu permits to the Brahmana four
wives, of whom one may be a Sudra, necessarily permitting,
therefore, a transition or quasi-amalgamation between the highest and
the lowest in the scale. Yajnavalkya permits this Brahmanical
communion with the Kshattriya and Vaisya, but not with the Sudra.
Later promulgators of law,[9] restrict the Brahmana to his own
class.

But although cast, once developed, admitted not of change, juridical
rules, subservient to cast, might and did progress: civil laws and
procedure became more comprehensive and exact, the criminal code more
regulated, lenient, and enlightened. And as universally, (for such is
human,) breaches and occasional disregard of rules have, silently
though surely, worked a change, or caused exceptional accessions to
the rules themselves.

The rule of the Sastras, that kingly power should belong to the
Kshattriya alone, was, even in the halcyon days of Hindu polity,
repeatedly set aside. Chandragupta, a Sudra, and his dynasty, held
sway over India from 315 to 173 B. C.: afterwards came Brahmanical
kings, the Kanwas, from 66 to 21 B. C.: whilst the mighty Gupta kings,
from 150 to 280 A. C., were Vaisyas.

The code of Manu presents a disarranged mass of regulations, in so
much that some have supposed the disorder to have been designed.

That conclusion, however, is repelled by the comparatively succinct
arrangement of Yajnavalkya and other sages. It is more consistent to
suppose, that Manu, as originally promulgated, was, from time to time,
added to, with an accidental disregard of method.

_Achara_, ritual, comprises the distinctive cast-ceremonies, domestic
and social usages, rites of purification, of sacrifice.

_Vyavahara_, may be called the juridical rules, embracing as well
substantive law as the procedure and practice of legal tribunals.

_Prayaschitta_, expiations, are the religious sanctions, or penalties
of sin; the divine visitation upon offenders, and the mode in which
the sinner may avert, by atonement, the consequences of divine
vengeance.

The date of Yajnavalkya's Dharma Sastra is not definitely or
satisfactorily fixed. From internal evidence, it is doubtless much
subsequent to Manu.

The data for conjecturing the period of Yajnavalkya are;

1. Reference is made to Buddhist habits and doctrines, _viz._ the
yellow garments, the baldhead, the Swabhava (B. I. sl. 271, 272, and
349).

Hence, this Dharma Sastra must have been promulgated later than B.
C. 500.

2. Reference is made to a previous Yoga Sastra promulgated by
Yajnavalkya (B. III, sl. 110). Now, the Yoga philosophy was first
shaped into a system by Patanjali who, according to Lassen, probably
flourished about 200 B. C.

3. Mention is made of coin as _nanaka_ (B. II, sl. 240). Now, the
word _nano_ occurs on the coins of the Indoscythian king, Kanerki,
who, according to Lassen, reigned until 40 A. C.

The result, though indefinite, places the earliest date of
Yajnavalkya's code towards the middle of the first century after
Christ.
