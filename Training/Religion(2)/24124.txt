As the turpentine tree I stretched out my branches, and my
branches are the branches of honour and grace.

Sir 24:17
As the vine brought I forth pleasant savour, and my flowers
are the fruit of honour and riches.

Sir 24:18
I am the mother of fair love, and fear, and knowledge, and
holy hope: I therefore, being eternal, am given to all my
children which are named of him.

Sir 24:19
Come unto me, all ye that be desirous of me, and fill
yourselves with my fruits.

Sir 24:20
For my memorial is sweeter than honey, and mine inheritance
than the honeycomb.

Sir 24:21
They that eat me shall yet be hungry, and they that drink me
shall yet be thirsty.

Sir 24:22
He that obeyeth me shall never be confounded, and they that
work by me shall not do amiss.

Sir 24:23
All these things are the book of the covenant of the most
high God, even the law which Moses commanded for an heritage
unto the congregations of Jacob.

Sir 24:24
Faint not to be strong in the Lord; that he may confirm you,
cleave unto him: for the Lord Almighty is God alone, and beside
him there is no other Saviour.

Sir 24:25
He filleth all things with his wisdom, as Phison and as
Tigris in the time of the new fruits.

Sir 24:26
He maketh the understanding to abound like Euphrates, and as
Jordan in the time of the harvest.

Sir 24:27
He maketh the doctrine of knowledge appear as the light, and
as Geon in the time of vintage.

Sir 24:28
The first man knew her not perfectly: no more shall the last
find her out.

Sir 24:29
For her thoughts are more than the sea, and her counsels
profounder than the great deep.

Sir 24:30
I also came out as a brook from a river, and as a conduit
into a garden.

Sir 24:31
I said, I will water my best garden, and will water
abundantly my garden bed: and, lo, my brook became a river, and
my river became a sea.

Sir 24:32
I will yet make doctrine to shine as the morning, and will
send forth her light afar off.

Sir 24:33
I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and leave it to all
ages for ever.

Sir 24:34
Behold that I have not laboured for myself only, but for all
them that seek wisdom.

Sir 25:1
In three things I was beautified, and stood up beautiful both
before God and men: the unity of brethren, the love of
neighbours, a man and a wife that agree together.

Sir 25:2
Three sorts of men my soul hateth, and I am greatly offended
at their life: a poor man that is proud, a rich man that is a
liar, and an old adulterer that doateth.

Sir 25:3
If thou hast gathered nothing in thy youth, how canst thou
find any thing in thine age?

Sir 25:4
O how comely a thing is judgment for gray hairs, and for
ancient men to know counsel!

Sir 25:5
O how comely is the wisdom of old men, and understanding and
counsel to men of honour.

Sir 25:6
Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God
is their glory.

Sir 25:7
There be nine things which I have judged in mine heart to be
happy, and the tenth I will utter with my tongue: A man that
hath joy of his children; and he that liveth to see the fall of
his enemy:

Sir 25:8
Well is him that dwelleth with a wife of understanding, and
that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served
a man more unworthy than himself:

Sir 25:9
Well is him that hath found prudence, and he that speaketh in
the ears of them that will hear:

Sir 25:10
O how great is he that findeth wisdom! yet is there none
above him that feareth the Lord.

Sir 25:11
But the love of the Lord passeth all things for illumination:
he that holdeth it, whereto shall he be likened?

Sir 25:12
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of his love: and faith
is the beginning of cleaving unto him.

Sir 25:13
[Give me] any plague, but the plague of the heart: and any
wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman:

Sir 25:14
And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate
me: and any revenge, but the revenge of enemies.

Sir 25:15
There is no head above the head of a serpent; and there is no
wrath above the wrath of an enemy.

Sir 25:16
I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon, than to keep
house with a wicked woman.

Sir 25:17
The wickedness of a woman changeth her face, and darkeneth
her countenance like sackcloth.

Sir 25:18
Her husband shall sit among his neighbours; and when he
heareth it shall sigh bitterly.

Sir 25:19
All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman:
let the portion of a sinner fall upon her.

Sir 25:20
As the climbing up a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so
is a wife full of words to a quiet man.

Sir 25:21
Stumble not at the beauty of a woman, and desire her not for
pleasure.

Sir 25:22
A woman, if she maintain her husband, is full of anger,
impudence, and much reproach.

Sir 25:23
A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavy
countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort
her husband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees.

Sir 25:24
Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her we
all die.

Sir 25:25
Give the water no passage; neither a wicked woman liberty to
gad abroad.

Sir 25:26
If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy
flesh, and give her a bill of divorce, and let her go.

Sir 26:1
Blessed is the man that hath a virtuous wife, for the number
of his days shall be double.

Sir 26:2
A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, and he shall fulfil
the years of his life in peace.

Sir 26:3
A good wife is a good portion, which shall be given in the
portion of them that fear the Lord.

Sir 26:4
Whether a man be rich or poor, if he have a good heart toward
the Lord, he shall at all times rejoice with a cheerful
countenance.

Sir 26:5
There be three things that mine heart feareth; and for the
fourth I was sore afraid: the slander of a city, the gathering
together of an unruly multitude, and a false accusation: all
these are worse than death.

Sir 26:6
But a grief of heart and sorrow is a woman that is jealous
over another woman, and a scourge of the tongue which
communicateth with all.

Sir 26:7
An evil wife is a yoke shaken to and fro: he that hath hold
of her is as though he held a scorpion.

Sir 26:8
A drunken woman and a gadder abroad causeth great anger, and
she will not cover her own shame.

Sir 26:9
The whoredom of a woman may be known in her haughty looks and
eyelids.

Sir 26:10
If thy daughter be shameless, keep her in straitly, lest she
abuse herself through overmuch liberty.

Sir 26:11
Watch over an impudent eye: and marvel not if she trespass
against thee.

Sir 26:12
She will open her mouth, as a thirsty traveller when he hath
found a fountain, and drink of every water near her: by every
hedge will she sit down, and open her quiver against every
arrow.

Sir 26:13
The grace of a wife delighteth her husband, and her
discretion will fatten his bones.

Sir 26:14
A silent and loving woman is a gift of the Lord; and there is
nothing so much worth as a mind well instructed.

Sir 26:15
A shamefaced and faithful woman is a double grace, and her
continent mind cannot be valued.

Sir 26:16
As the sun when it ariseth in the high heaven; so is the
beauty of a good wife in the ordering of her house.

Sir 26:17
As the clear light is upon the holy candlestick; so is the
beauty of the face in ripe age.

Sir 26:18
As the golden pillars are upon the sockets of silver; so are
the fair feet with a constant heart.

Sir 26:19
My son, keep the flower of thine age sound; and give not thy
strength to strangers.

Sir 26:20
When thou hast gotten a fruitful possession through all the
field, sow it with thine own seed, trusting in the goodness of
thy stock.

Sir 26:21
So thy race which thou leavest shall be magnified, having the
confidence of their good descent.

Sir 26:22
An harlot shall be accounted as spittle; but a married woman
is a tower against death to her husband.

Sir 26:23
A wicked woman is given as a portion to a wicked man: but a
godly woman is given to him that feareth the Lord.

Sir 26:24
A dishonest woman contemneth shame: but an honest woman will
reverence her husband.

Sir 26:25
A shameless woman shall be counted as a dog; but she that is
shamefaced will fear the Lord.

Sir 26:26
A woman that honoureth her husband shall be judged wise of
all; but she that dishonoureth him in her pride shall be counted
ungodly of all.

Sir 26:27
A loud crying woman and a scold shall be sought out to drive
away the enemies.

Sir 26:28
There be two things that grieve my heart; and the third
maketh me angry: a man of war that suffereth poverty; and men of
understanding that are not set by; and one that returneth from
righteousness to sin; the Lord prepareth such an one for the
sword.

Sir 26:29
A merchant shall hardly keep himself from doing wrong; and an
huckster shall not be freed from sin.

Sir 27:1
Many have sinned for a small matter; and he that seeketh for
abundance will turn his eyes away.

Sir 27:2
As a nail sticketh fast between the joinings of the stones;
so doth sin stick close between buying and selling.

Sir 27:3
Unless a man hold himself diligently in the fear of the Lord,
his house shall soon be overthrown.

Sir 27:4
As when one sifteth with a sieve, the refuse remaineth; so
the filth of man in his talk.

Sir 27:5
The furnace proveth the potter's vessels; so the trial of man
is in his reasoning.

Sir 27:6
The fruit declareth if the tree have been dressed; so is the
utterance of a conceit in the heart of man.

Sir 27:7
Praise no man before thou hearest him speak; for this is the
trial of men.

Sir 27:8
If thou followest righteousness, thou shalt obtain her, and
put her on, as a glorious long robe.

Sir 27:9
The birds will resort unto their like; so will truth return
unto them that practise in her.

Sir 27:10
As the lion lieth in wait for the prey; so sin for them that
work iniquity.

Sir 27:11
The discourse of a godly man is always with wisdom; but a
fool changeth as the moon.

Sir 27:12
If thou be among the indiscreet, observe the time; but be
continually among men of understanding.

Sir 27:13
The discourse of fools is irksome, and their sport is the
wantonness of sin.

Sir 27:14
The talk of him that sweareth much maketh the hair stand
upright; and their brawls make one stop his ears.

Sir 27:15
The strife of the proud is bloodshedding, and their revilings
are grievous to the ear.

Sir 27:16
Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit; and shall never
find friend to his mind.

Sir 27:17
Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him: but if thou
betrayest his secrets, follow no more after him.

Sir 27:18
For as a man hath destroyed his enemy; so hast thou lost the
love of thy neighbor.

Sir 27:19
As one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thou
let thy neighbour go, and shalt not get him again

Sir 27:20
Follow after him no more, for he is too far off; he is as a
roe escaped out of the snare.

Sir 27:21
As for a wound, it may be bound up; and after reviling there
may be reconcilement: but he that betrayeth secrets is without
hope.

Sir 27:22
He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil: and he that
knoweth him will depart from him.

Sir 27:23
When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, and will admire
thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slander
thy sayings.

Sir 27:24
I have hated many things, but nothing like him; for the Lord
will hate him.

Sir 27:25
Whoso casteth a stone on high casteth it on his own head; and
a deceitful stroke shall make wounds.

Sir 27:26
Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that setteth a
trap shall be taken therein.

Sir 27:27
He that worketh mischief, it shall fall upon him, and he
shall not know whence it cometh.

Sir 27:28
Mockery and reproach are from the proud; but vengeance, as a
lion, shall lie in wait for them.

Sir 27:29
They that rejoice at the fall of the righteous shall be taken
in the snare; and anguish shall consume them before they die.

Sir 27:30
Malice and wrath, even these are abominations; and the sinful
man shall have them both.

Sir 28:1
He that revengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he
will surely keep his sins [in remembrance.]

Sir 28:2
Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done unto thee,
so shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest.

Sir 28:3
One man beareth hatred against another, and doth he seek
pardon from the Lord?

Sir 28:4
He sheweth no mercy to a man, which is like himself: and doth
he ask forgiveness of his own sins?

Sir 28:5
If he that is but flesh nourish hatred, who will intreat for
pardon of his sins?

Sir 28:6
Remember thy end, and let enmity cease; [remember] corruption
and death, and abide in the commandments.

Sir 28:7
Remember the commandments, and bear no malice to thy
neighbour: [remember] the covenant of the Highest, and wink at
ignorance.

Sir 28:8
Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins: for a
furious man will kindle strife,

Sir 28:9
A sinful man disquieteth friends, and maketh debate among
them that be at peace.

Sir 28:10
As the matter of the fire is, so it burneth: and as a man's
strength is, so is his wrath; and according to his riches his
anger riseth; and the stronger they are which contend, the more
they will be inflamed.

Sir 28:11
An hasty contention kindleth a fire: and an hasty fighting
sheddeth blood.

Sir 28:12
If thou blow the spark, it shall burn: if thou spit upon it,
it shall be quenched: and both these come out of thy mouth.

Sir 28:13
Curse the whisperer and doubletongued: for such have
destroyed many that were at peace.

Sir 28:14
A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them
from nation to nation: strong cities hath it pulled down, and
overthrown the houses of great men.

Sir 28:15
A backbiting tongue hath cast out virtuous women, and
deprived them of their labours.

Sir 28:16
Whoso hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest, and never
dwell quietly.

Sir 28:17
The stroke of the whip maketh marks in the flesh: but the
stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones.

Sir 28:18
Many have fallen by the edge of the sword: but not so many as
have fallen by the tongue.

Sir 28:19
Well is he that is defended through the venom thereof; who
hath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor hath been bound in her
bands.

Sir 28:20
For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bands thereof
are bands of brass.

Sir 28:21
The death thereof is an evil death, the grave were better
than it.

Sir 28:22
It shall not have rule over them that fear God, neither shall
they be burned with the flame thereof.

Sir 28:23
Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it; and it shall
burn in them, and not be quenched; it shall be sent upon them as
a lion, and devour them as a leopard.

Sir 28:24
Look that thou hedge thy possession about with thorns, and
bind up thy silver and gold,

Sir 28:25
And weigh thy words in a balance, and make a door and bar for
thy mouth.

Sir 28:26
Beware thou slide not by it, lest thou fall before him that
lieth in wait.

Sir 29:1
He that is merciful will lend unto his neighbour; and he that
strengtheneth his hand keepeth the commandments.

Sir 29:2
Lend to thy neighbour in time of his need, and pay thou thy
neighbour again in due season.

Sir 29:3
Keep thy word, and deal faithfully with him, and thou shalt
always find the thing that is necessary for thee.

Sir 29:4
Many, when a thing was lent them, reckoned it to be found,
and put them to trouble that helped them.

Sir 29:5
Till he hath received, he will kiss a man's hand; and for his
neighbour's money he will speak submissly: but when he should
repay, he will prolong the time, and return words of grief, and
complain of the time.

Sir 29:6
If he prevail, he shall hardly receive the half, and he will
count as if he had found it: if not, he hath deprived him of his
money, and he hath gotten him an enemy without cause: he payeth
him with cursings and railings; and for honour he will pay him
disgrace.

Sir 29:7
Many therefore have refused to lend for other men's ill
dealing, fearing to be defrauded.

Sir 29:8
Yet have thou patience with a man in poor estate, and delay
not to shew him mercy.

Sir 29:9
Help the poor for the commandment's sake, and turn him not
away because of his poverty.

Sir 29:10
Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend, and let it not
rust under a stone to be lost.

Sir 29:11
Lay up thy treasure according to the commandments of the most
High, and it shall bring thee more profit than gold.

Sir 29:12
Shut up alms in thy storehouses: and it shall deliver thee
from all affliction.

Sir 29:13
It shall fight for thee against thine enemies better than a
mighty shield and strong spear.

Sir 29:14
An honest man is surety for his neighbour: but he that is
impudent will forsake him.

Sir 29:15
Forget not the friendship of thy surety, for he hath given
his life for thee.

Sir 29:16
A sinner will overthrow the good estate of his surety:

Sir 29:17
And he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him [in
danger] that delivered him.

Sir 29:18
Suretiship hath undone many of good estate, and shaken them
as a wave of the sea: mighty men hath it driven from their
houses, so that they wandered among strange nations.

Sir 29:19
A wicked man transgressing the commandments of the Lord shall
fall into suretiship: and he that undertaketh and followeth
other men's business for gain shall fall into suits.

Sir 29:20
Help thy neighbour according to thy power, and beware that
thou thyself fall not into the same.

Sir 29:21
The chief thing for life is water, and bread, and clothing,
and an house to cover shame.

Sir 29:22
Better is the life of a poor man in a mean cottage, than
delicate fare in another man's house.

Sir 29:23
Be it little or much, hold thee contented, that thou hear not
the reproach of thy house.

Sir 29:24
For it is a miserable life to go from house to house: for
where thou art a stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth.

Sir 29:25
Thou shalt entertain, and feast, and have no thanks: moreover
thou shalt hear bitter words:

Sir 29:26
Come, thou stranger, and furnish a table, and feed me of that
thou hast ready.

Sir 29:27
Give place, thou stranger, to an honourable man; my brother
cometh to be lodged, and I have need of mine house.

Sir 29:28
These things are grievous to a man of understanding; the
upbraiding of houseroom, and reproaching of the lender.

Sir 30:1
He that loveth his son causeth him oft to feel the rod, that
he may have joy of him in the end.

Sir 30:2
He that chastiseth his son shall have joy in him, and shall
rejoice of him among his acquaintance.

Sir 30:3
He that teacheth his son grieveth the enemy: and before his
friends he shall rejoice of him.

Sir 30:4
Though his father die, yet he is as though he were not dead:
for he hath left one behind him that is like himself.

Sir 30:5
While he lived, he saw and rejoiced in him: and when he died,
he was not sorrowful.

Sir 30:6
He left behind him an avenger against his enemies, and one
that shall requite kindness to his friends.

Sir 30:7
He that maketh too much of his son shall bind up his wounds;
and his bowels will be troubled at every cry.

Sir 30:8
An horse not broken becometh headstrong: and a child left to
himself will be wilful.

Sir 30:9
Cocker thy child, and he shall make thee afraid: play with
him, and he will bring thee to heaviness.

Sir 30:10
Laugh not with him, lest thou have sorrow with him, and lest
thou gnash thy teeth in the end.

Sir 30:11
Give him no liberty in his youth, and wink not at his
follies.

Sir 30:12
Bow down his neck while he is young, and beat him on the
sides while he is a child, lest he wax stubborn, and be
disobedient unto thee, and so bring sorrow to thine heart.

Sir 30:13
Chastise thy son, and hold him to labour, lest his lewd
behaviour be an offence unto thee.

Sir 30:14
Better is the poor, being sound and strong of constitution,
than a rich man that is afflicted in his body.

Sir 30:15
Health and good estate of body are above all gold, and a
strong body above infinite wealth.

Sir 30:16
There is no riches above a sound body, and no joy above the
joy of the heart.

Sir 30:17
Death is better than a bitter life or continual sickness.

Sir 30:18
Delicates poured upon a mouth shut up are as messes of meat
set upon a grave.

Sir 30:19
What good doeth the offering unto an idol? for neither can it
eat nor smell: so is he that is persecuted of the Lord.

Sir 30:20
He seeth with his eyes and groaneth, as an eunuch that
embraceth a virgin and sigheth.

Sir 30:21
Give not over thy mind to heaviness, and afflict not thyself
in thine own counsel.

Sir 30:22
The gladness of the heart is the life of man, and the
joyfulness of a man prolongeth his days.

Sir 30:23
Love thine own soul, and comfort thy heart, remove sorrow far
from thee: for sorrow hath killed many, and there is no profit
therein.

Sir 30:24
Envy and wrath shorten the life, and carefulness bringeth age
before the time.

Sir 30:25
A cheerful and good heart will have a care of his meat and
diet.

Sir 31:1
Watching for riches consumeth the flesh, and the care thereof
driveth away sleep.

Sir 31:2
Watching care will not let a man slumber, as a sore disease
breaketh sleep,

Sir 31:3
The rich hath great labour in gathering riches together; and
when he resteth, he is filled with his delicates.

Sir 31:4
The poor laboureth in his poor estate; and when he leaveth
off, he is still needy.

Sir 31:5
He that loveth gold shall not be justified, and he that
followeth corruption shall have enough thereof.

Sir 31:6
Gold hath been the ruin of many, and their destruction was
present.

Sir 31:7
It is a stumblingblock unto them that sacrifice unto it, and
every fool shall be taken therewith.

Sir 31:8
Blessed is the rich that is found without blemish, and hath
not gone after gold.

Sir 31:9
Who is he? and we will call him blessed: for wonderful things
hath he done among his people.

Sir 31:10
Who hath been tried thereby, and found perfect? then let him
glory. Who might offend, and hath not offended? or done evil,
and hath not done it?

Sir 31:11
His goods shall be established, and the congregation shall
declare his alms.

Sir 31:12
If thou sit at a bountiful table, be not greedy upon it, and
say not, There is much meat on it.

Sir 31:13
Remember that a wicked eye is an evil thing: and what is
created more wicked than an eye? therefore it weepeth upon every
occasion.

Sir 31:14
Stretch not thine hand whithersoever it looketh, and thrust
it not with him into the dish.

Sir 31:15
Judge not thy neighbour by thyself: and be discreet in every
point.

Sir 31:16
Eat as it becometh a man, those things which are set before
thee; and devour note, lest thou be hated.

Sir 31:17
Leave off first for manners' sake; and be not unsatiable,
lest thou offend.

Sir 31:18
When thou sittest among many, reach not thine hand out first
of all.

Sir 31:19
A very little is sufficient for a man well nurtured, and he
fetcheth not his wind short upon his bed.

Sir 31:20
Sound sleep cometh of moderate eating: he riseth early, and
his wits are with him: but the pain of watching, and choler, and
pangs of the belly, are with an unsatiable man.

Sir 31:21
And if thou hast been forced to eat, arise, go forth, vomit,
and thou shalt have rest.

Sir 31:22
My son, hear me, and despise me not, and at the last thou
shalt find as I told thee: in all thy works be quick, so shall
there no sickness come unto thee.

Sir 31:23
Whoso is liberal of his meat, men shall speak well of him;
and the report of his good housekeeping will be believed.

Sir 31:24
But against him that is a niggard of his meat the whole city
shall murmur; and the testimonies of his niggardness shall not
be doubted of.

Sir 31:25
Shew not thy valiantness in wine; for wine hath destroyed
many.

Sir 31:26
The furnace proveth the edge by dipping: so doth wine the
hearts of the proud by drunkeness.

Sir 31:27
Wine is as good as life to a man, if it be drunk moderately:
what life is then to a man that is without wine? for it was made
to make men glad.

Sir 31:28
Wine measurably drunk and in season bringeth gladness of the
heart, and cheerfulness of the mind:

Sir 31:29
But wine drunken with excess maketh bitterness of the mind,
with brawling and quarrelling.

Sir 31:30
Drunkenness increaseth the rage of a fool till he offend: it
diminisheth strength, and maketh wounds.

Sir 31:31
Rebuke not thy neighbour at the wine, and despise him not in
his mirth: give him no despiteful words, and press not upon him
with urging him [to drink.]

Sir 32:1
