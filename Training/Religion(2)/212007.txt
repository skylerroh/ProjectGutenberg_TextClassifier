
Do you upon the landing stand,
  While here I'll kneel and blow,
So that the little "Water-witch"
  Beneath the arch may go.

There! there! she's off! how fast she goes
  Across the river wide!
I'd love to sit in her myself,
  And o'er the water glide.

When I'm a man I'll have a boat,
  And every sunny day,
We'll take a long and pleasant sail,
  Till daylight fades away.

SUNDAY.


[Illustration: Letter G.]

God made the day of rest,
  The holy Sabbath day,
For us to think and talk of Him,
  And not for work or play.

I'll put away my toys
  Safely, the night before;
And Sundays I'll be very still,
  Till Monday comes once more.

And then mamma will say,
  That, though I am so small,
I yet can please the great, good God,
  Who takes care of us all.

I love these Sabbath days,
  Which God to us doth give;
And may I love them more and more,
  Each day and year I live!




THE MEDDLESOME CHILD.


[Illustration: Letter L.]

Little Lucy was left in the room once alone,
  Where the table was set out for tea;
She looked all around, and she thought to herself
  That no one was there who could see.

Then she climbed on a chair and took off the top
  Of the sugar-bowl, shining and bright;
And there were the lumps of the sugar she loved,
  All looking so nice and so white!

Then she said to herself, "Mamma never will know,
  If I take away only just one;"
So she took it, and ate it;--it tasted so good,
  She thought, "But one more, and I've done."

But while she was reaching her hand out for more,
  The chair slipped away from her feet;
And poor little Lucy soon wished much that she
  Had not taken the sugar so sweet:

For her head struck the floor, and made such a noise,
  That every one hastened to see;
And all of them knew, by the sugar she held,
  How naughty Miss Lucy could be!

And no one was sorry, although her poor head
  Ached sadly because of her fall;
For little girls never--so every one said--
  Should taste or should meddle at all.




GOD SEES ME ALWAYS.


[Illustration: Letter G.]

God sees me always. When I sleep,
  He kindly watches near;
He loves the little child to keep,
  Who tries to please Him here.

When I'm alone He sees me too,
  Though no one else is by;
And every naughty thing I do,
  He sees it from on high.

He sees me, too, when I am rude,
  And cry, and fret, and tease;
He loves to see me when I'm good
  And try mamma to please.

Then, since He sees me day and night,
  And is so kind to me,
I must do always what is right,
  His gentle child must be.

THE ARK AND THE DOVE.


[Illustration: Letter A.]

A rain once fell upon the earth
  For many a day and night,
And hid the flowers, the grass, the trees,
  The birds and beasts, from sight.

The deep waves covered all the land,
  And mountain-tops so high;
And nothing could be seen around,
  But water, and the sky.

But yet there was one moving thing,--
  A still and lonely ark,--
That, many a weary day and night,
  Sailed o'er that ocean dark.

At last, a little dove was forth
  From that lone vessel sent;
But, wearied, to the ark again,
  When evening came, she bent.

Again she went, but soon returned,
  And in her beak was seen
A little twig--an olive-branch--
  With leaves of shining green.

The waters sank, and then the dove
  Flew from the ark once more,
And came not back, but lived among
  The tree-tops, as before.

Then from the ark they all came forth,
  With songs of joy and praise;
And once again the green earth smiled
  Beneath the sun's warm rays.




THE BEE.


[Illustration]

Now, Ellen, stop screaming and running away,
  And come here and listen to me;
Is it true, my dear daughter, I want you to say,
  That you're foolishly scared by a bee?

The bee is as frightened as you are, my dear,
  For he can't tell the way to get out;
And as for his sting, that you never need fear,
  If you do not run crying about.

If you were to catch him, why, then, I dare say
  You'd soon feel his sharp little sting;
But if you sit still at your work or your play,
  Be sure that no harm he will bring.

So wipe off these tears and never again
  Give way to so foolish a fright;
For if you indulge it 't will cost you much pain
  And no one will want you in sight.

SUNDAY.


[Illustration: Letter T.]

'T is Sunday morning, dear mamma!
  I do not wish to play;
Last night I put my dolls and toys
  Safe in my box away.

I'll come and sit down by your side,
  While you the story tell
Of the good little Joseph, whom
  His father loved so well.

And of the time when waters dark
  Covered the world around;
And all but Noah in his ark,
  Beneath the waves were drowned.

And of the gentle dove, that forth
  O'er those wide waters flew,
And twice, with weary wing, returned,
  No resting-place in view.

And how the infant Moses, too,
  Floated the Nile along;
And how his mother made for him
  The basket cradle strong.

Please tell these Bible-stories then,
  And take me on your knee,
And I'll sit still, my dear mamma,
  And listen quietly.

THE PLEASANT WORLD.


[Illustration: Letter I.]

I love to see the sun go down
  Behind the western hill;
I love to see the night come on,
  When everything is still.

I love to see the moon and stars
  Shine brightly in the sky;
I love to see the rolling clouds
  Above my head so high.

I love to see the little flowers
  That grow up from the ground;
To hear the wind blow through the trees,
  And make a rustling sound.

I love to see the sheep and lambs
  So happy in their play;
I love to hear the small birds sing
  Sweetly, at close of day.

I love to see them _all_, because
  They are so bright and fair;
And He who made this pleasant world
  Will listen to my prayer.
