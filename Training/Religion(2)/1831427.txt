for sin prevent the wrong action? It is the love of God,
and not the fear of evil, that is the incentive in Science. [5]
I rejoice with those who rejoice, and am too apt to weep
with those who weep, but over and above it all are eter-
nal sunshine and joy unspeakable.




The March Primary Class


TO THE PRIMARY CLASS OF THE MASSACHUSETTS METAPHYSICAL
COLLEGE, 571 COLUMBUS AVENUE, THAT ASSEMBLED FEB. 25,
1889, WITH AN ATTENDANCE OF SIXTY-FIVE STUDENTS

My students, three picture-stories from the Bible pre-
sent themselves to my thought; three of those pictures
from which we learn without study. The first is that of [15]
Joshua and his band before the walls of Jericho. They
went seven times around these walls, the seven times
corresponding to the seven days of creation: the six days
are to find out the nothingness of matter; the seventh
is the day of rest, when it is found that evil is naught [20]
and good is all.

The second picture is of the disciples met together in
an upper chamber; and they were of one mind. Mark,
that in the case of Joshua and his band they had all to
shout _together_ in order that the walls might fall; and the [25]
disciples, too, were of one mind.

We, to-day, in this class-room, are enough to con-
vert the world if we are of one Mind; for then the whole
world will feel the influence of this Mind; as when

[Page 280.]

earth was without form, and Mind spake and form [1]
appeared.

The third picture-lesson is from Revelation, where, at
the opening of the seals, one of the angels presented him-
self with balances to weigh the thoughts and actions of [5]
men; not angels with wings, but messengers of pure and
holy thoughts that say, See thou hurt not the holy things
of Truth.

You have come to be weighed; and yet, I would not
weigh you, nor have you weighed. How is this? Be- [10]
cause God does all, and there is nothing in the opposite
scale. There are not two,--Mind _and_ matter. We
must get rid of that notion. As we commonly think, we
imagine all is well if we cast something into the scale of
Mind, but we must realize that Mind is not put into the [15]
scales with matter; then only are we working on one side
and in Science.

The students of this Primary class, dismissed the fifth
of March, at close of the lecture on the fourth presented
their teacher with an elegant album costing fifty dollars, [20]
and containing beautiful hand-painted flowers on each
page, with their autographs. The presentation was made
in a brief address by Mr. D.A. Easton, who in appro-
priate language and metaphor expressed his fellow-students'
thanks to their teacher. [25]

On the morning of the fifth, I met the class to answer
some questions before their dismissal, and allude briefly
to a topic of great import to the student of Christian
Science,--the rocks and sirens in their course, on and
by which so many wrecks are made. The doors of animal [30]
magnetism open wide for the entrance of error, some-
times just at the moment when you are ready to enter on

[Page 281.]

the fruition of your labors, and with laudable ambition [1]
are about to chant hymns of victory for triumphs.

The doors that this animal element flings open are
those of rivalry, jealousy, envy, revenge. It is the self-
asserting mortal will-power that you must guard against. [5]
But I find also another mental condition of yours that
fills me with joy. I learned long ago that the world could
neither deprive me of something nor give me anything,
and I have now one ambition and one joy. But if
one cherishes ambition unwisely, one will be chastened [10]
for it.

Admiral Coligny, in the time of the French Huguenots,
was converted to Protestantism through a stray copy of
the Scriptures that fell into his hands. He replied to his
wife, who urged him to come out and confess his faith, [15]
"It is wise to count the cost of becoming a true Chris-
tian." She answered him, "It is wiser to count the cost
of _not_ becoming a true Christian." So, whatever we meet
that is hard in the Christian warfare we must count as
nothing, and must think instead, of our poverty and help- [20]
lessness without this understanding, and count ourselves
always as debtors to Christ, Truth.

Among the gifts of my students, this of yours is one
of the most beautiful and the most costly, because you
have signed your names. I felt the weight of this yes- [25]
terday, but it came to me more clearly this morning when
I realized what a responsibility you assume when sub-
scribing to Christian Science. But, whatever may come
to you, remember the words of Solomon, "Though hand
join in hand, the wicked shall not go unpunished: but [30]
the seed of the righteous shall be delivered."

You will need, in future, _practice_ more than theory.

[Page 282.]

You are going out to demonstrate a living faith, a true [1]
sense of the infinite good, a sense that does not limit God,
but brings to human view an enlarged sense of Deity.
Remember, it is personality, and the sense of personality
in God or in man, that limits man. [5]




Obtrusive Mental Healing


The question will present itself: Shall people be treated
mentally without their knowledge or consent? The
direct rule for practice of Christian Science is the Golden
Rule, "As ye would that men should do to you, do ye," [10]
Who of us would have our houses broken open or our
locks picked? and much less would we have our minds
tampered with.

Our Master said, "When ye enter a house, salute it."
Prolonging the metaphysical tone of his command, I say, [15]
When you enter mentally the personal precincts of human
thought, you should know that the person with whom
you hold communion desires it. There are solitary ex-
ceptions to most given rules: the following is an exception
to the above rule of mental practice. [20]

If the friends of a patient desire you to treat him with-
out his knowing it, and they believe in the efficacy of
Mind-healing, it is sometimes wise to do so, and the end
justifies the means; for he is restored through Christian
Science when other means have failed. One other oc- [25]
casion which may call for aid unsought, is a case from
accident, when there is no time for ceremony and no other
aid is near.

The abuse which I call attention to, is promiscuous

[Page 283.]

and unannounced mental practice where there is no neces- [1]
sity for it, or the motive is mercenary, or one can to ad-
vantage speak the truth audibly; then the case is not
exceptional. As a rule, one has no more right to enter
the mind of a person, stir, upset, and adjust his thoughts [5]
without his knowledge or consent, than one has to enter
a house, unlock the desk, displace the furniture, and suit
one's self in the arrangement and management of another
man's property.

It would be right to break into a burning building and [10]
rouse the slumbering inmates, but wrong to burst open
doors and break through windows if no emergency de-
manded this. Any exception to the old wholesome rule,
"Mind your own business," is rare. For a student of
mine to treat another student without his knowledge, is [15]
a breach of good manners and morals; it is nothing less
than a mistaken kindness, a culpable ignorance, or a
conscious trespass on the rights of mortals.

I insist on the etiquette of Christian Science, as well
as its morals and Christianity. The Scriptural rule of [20]
this Science may momentarily be forgotten; but this is
seldom the case with loyal students, or done without
incriminating the person who did it.

Each student should, must, work out his own problem
of being; conscious, meanwhile, that God worketh with [25]
him, and that he needs no personal aid. It is the genius
of Christian Science to demonstrate good, not evil,--
harmony, not discord; for Science is the mandate of
Truth which destroys all error.

Whoever is honestly laboring to learn the principle of [30]
music and practise it, seldom calls on his teacher or mu-
sician to practise for him. The only personal help re-

[Page 284.]

quired in this Science is for each one to do his own work [1]
well, and never try to hinder others from doing theirs
thus.

Christian Science, more than any other system of
religion, morals, or medicine, is subject to abuses. Its [5]
infinite nature and uses occasion this. Even the human-
itarian at work in this field of limitless power and good
may possess a zeal without knowledge, and thus mistake
the sphere of his present usefulness.

Students who strictly adhere to the right, and make the [10]
Bible and Science and Health a study, are in no danger
of mistaking their way.

This question is often proposed, How shall I treat
malicious animal magnetism? The hour has passed for
this evil to be treated personally, but it should have been [15]
so dealt with at the outset. Christian Scientists should
have gone personally to the malpractitioner and told
him his fault, and vindicated divine Truth and Love
against human error and hate. This growing sin must
now be dealt with as evil, and not as an evil-doer or per- [20]
sonality It must also be remembered that neither an evil
claim nor an evil person is _real_, hence is neither to be
_feared_ nor honored.

Evil is not something to fear and flee before, or that
becomes more real when it is grappled with. Evil let [25]
alone grows more real, aggressive, and enlarges its claims;
but, met with Science, it can and will be mastered by
Science.

I deprecate personal animosities and quarrels. But if
one is intrusted with the rules of church government, to [30]
fulfil that trust those rules must be carried out; thus it
is with all moral obligations. I am opposed to all personal

[Page 285.]

attacks, and in favor of combating evil only, rather than [1]
person.

An edition of one thousand pamphlets I ordered to
be laid away and not one of them circulated, because I
had been personal in condemnation. Afterwards, by a [5]
blunder of the gentleman who fills orders for my books,
some of these pamphlets were mistaken for the corrected
edition, and sold.

Love is the fulfilling of the law. Human life is too
short for foibles or failures. _The Christian Science Jour-_ [10]
_nal_ will hold high the banner of Truth and Love, and be
impartial and impersonal in its tenor and tenets.




Wedlock


It was about the year 1875 that Science and Health
first crossed swords with free-love, and the latter fell _hors_ [15]
_de combat_; but the whole warfare of sensuality was not
then ended. Science and Health, the book that cast the
first stone, is still at work, deep down in human conscious-
ness, laying the axe at the root of error.

We have taken the precaution to write briefly on mar- [20]
riage, showing its relation to Christian Science. In the
present or future, some extra throe of error may conjure
up a new-style conjugality, which, _ad libitum_, severs the
marriage covenant, puts virtue in the shambles, and
coolly notifies the public of broken vows. Springing [25]
up from the ashes of free-love, this nondescript phoenix,
in the face and eyes of common law, common sense, and
common honesty, may appear in the _role_ of a superfine
conjugality; but, having no Truth, it will have no past,
present, or future. [30]

[Page 286.]

The above prophecy, written years ago, has already [1]
been fulfilled. It is seen in Christian Science that the
gospel of marriage is not without the law, and the solemn
vow of fidelity, "until death do us part;" this verity in
human economy can neither be obscured nor throttled. [5]
Until time matures human growth, marriage and progeny
will continue unprohibited in Christian Science. We look
to future generations for ability to comply with absolute
Science, when marriage shall be found to be man's one-
ness with God,--the unity of eternal Love. At present, [10]
more spiritual conception and education of children will
serve to illustrate the superiority of spiritual power over
sensuous, and usher in the dawn of God's creation,
wherein they neither marry nor are given in marriage,
but are as the angels. To abolish marriage at this period, [15]
and maintain morality and generation, would put inge-
nuity to ludicrous shifts; yet this is possible in _Science_,
although it is to-day problematic.

The time cometh, and now is, for spiritual and eternal
existence to be recognized and understood in Science. [20]
All is Mind. Human procreation, birth, life, and death
are subjective states of the human erring mind; they
are the phenomena of mortality, nothingness, that illus-
trate mortal mind and body as _one_, and neither real nor
eternal. [25]

It should be understood that Spirit, God, is the only
creator: we should recognize this verity of being, and
shut out all sense of other claims. Until this absolute
Science of being is seen, understood, and demonstrated
in the offspring of divine Mind, and man is perfect even [30]
as the Father is perfect, human speculation will go on,
and stop at length at the spiritual ultimate: creation

[Page 287.]

understood as the most exalted divine conception. The [1]
offspring of an improved generation, however, will go out
before the forever fact that man is eternal and has no
human origin. Hence the Scripture: "It is He that hath
made us, and not we ourselves;" and the Master's de- [5]
mand, "Call no man your father upon the earth: for one
is your Father, which is in heaven."

To an ill-attuned ear, discord is harmony; so personal
sense, discerning not the legitimate affection of Soul,
may place love on a false basis and thereby lose it. Science [10]
corrects this error with the truth of Love, and restores
lost Eden. Soul is the infinite source of bliss: only high
and holy joy can satisfy immortal cravings. The good
in human affections should preponderate over the evil,
and the spiritual over the animal,--until progress lifts [15]
mortals to discern the Science of mental formation and
find the highway of holiness.

In the order of wisdom, the higher nature of man
governs the lower. This lays the foundations of human
affection in line with progress, giving them strength and [20]
permanence.

When asked by a wife or a husband important ques-
tions concerning their happiness, the substance of my reply
is: God will guide you. Be faithful over home rela-
tions; they lead to higher joys: obey the Golden Rule [25]
for human life, and it will spare you much bitterness.
It is pleasanter to do right than wrong; it makes one
ruler over one's self and hallows home,--which is woman's
world. Please your husband, and he will be apt to please
you; preserve affection on both sides. [30]

Great mischief comes from attempts to steady other
people's altars, venturing on valor without discretion,

[Page 288.]

which is virtually meddlesomeness. Even your sincere [1]
and courageous convictions regarding what is best for
others may be mistaken; you must be demonstratively
right yourself, and work out the greatest good to the
greatest number, before you are sure of being a fit coun- [5]
sellor. Positive and imperative thoughts should be dropped
into the balances of God and weighed by spiritual Love,
and not be found wanting, before being put into action.
A rash conclusion that regards only one side of a ques-
tion, is weak and wicked; this error works out the results [10]
of error. If the premise of mortal existence is wrong,
any conclusion drawn therefrom is not absolutely right.
Wisdom in human action begins with what is nearest
right under the circumstances, and thence achieves the
absolute. [15]

Is marriage nearer right than celibacy?

Human knowledge inculcates that it is, while Science
indicates that it _is not_. But to force the consciousness
of scientific being before it is understood is impossible,
and believing otherwise would prevent scientific demon- [20]
stration. To reckon the universal cost and gain, as well
as thine own, is right in every state and stage of being.
The selfish _role_ of a martyr is the shift of a dishonest
mind, nothing short of self-seeking; and real suffering
would stop the farce. [25]

The cause of temperance receives a strong impulse
from the cause of Christian Science: temperance and
truth are allies, and their cause prospers in proportion
to the spirit of Love that nerves the struggle. People
will differ in their opinions as to means to promote the [30]
ends of temperance; that is, abstinence from intoxicat-
ing beverages. Whatever intoxicates a man, stultifies,

[Page 289.]

and causes him to degenerate physically and morally. [1]
Strong drink is unquestionably an evil, and evil cannot
be used temperately: its slightest use is abuse; hence
the only temperance is total abstinence. Drunkenness
is sensuality let loose, in whatever form it is made [5]
manifest.

What is evil? It is suppositional absence of good.
From a human standpoint of good, mortals must first
choose between evils, and of two evils choose the less;
and at present the application of scientific rules to hu- [10]
man life seems to rest on this basis.

All partnerships are formed on agreements to certain
compacts: each party voluntarily surrenders independ-
ent action to act as a whole and per agreement. This
fact should be duly considered when by the marriage [15]
contract two are made one, and, according to the divine
precept, "they twain shall be one flesh." Oneness in
spirit is Science, compatible with home and heaven.
Neither divine justice nor human equity has _divorced_
two minds in one. [20]

Rights that are bargained away must not be retaken
by the contractors, except by mutual consent. Human
nature has bestowed on a wife the right to become a
mother; but if the wife esteems not this privilege, by
mutual consent, exalted and increased affections, she [25]
may win a higher. Science touches the conjugal ques-
tion on the basis of a bill of rights. Can the bill of con-
jugal rights be fairly stated by a magistrate, or by a
minister? Mutual interests and affections are the spirit
of these rights, and they should be consulted, augmented, [30]
and allowed to rise to the spiritual altitude whence they
can choose only good.

[Page 290.]

A third person is not a party to the compact of two [1]
hearts. Let other people's marriage relations _alone_: two
persons only, should be found within their precincts.
The nuptial vow is never annulled so long as the animus
of the contract is preserved intact. Science lifts humanity [5]
higher in the scale of harmony, and must ultimately break
all bonds that hinder progress.




Judge Not


Mistaken views ought to be dissolving views, since
whatever is false should disappear. To suppose that hu- [10]
man love, guided by the divine Principle, which is Love,
is partial, unmerciful, or unjust, indicates misapprehen-
sion of the divine Principle and its workings in the human
heart.

A person wrote to me, naming the time of the occur- [15]
rence, "I felt the influence of your thought on my mind,
and it produced a wonderful illumination, peace, and
understanding;" but, I had not thought of the writer
at that time. I knew that this person was doing well,
and my affections involuntarily flow out towards all. [20]

When will the world cease to judge of causes from a
personal sense of things, conjectural and misapprehen-
sive! When thought dwells in God,--and it should not,
to our consciousness, dwell elsewhere,--one must bene-
fit those who hold a place in one's memory, whether it [25]
be friend or foe, and each share the benefit of that radia-
tion. This individual blessedness and blessing comes
not so much from individual as from universal love: it
emits light because it reflects; and all who are receptive
share this equally. [30]

[Page 291.]

Mistaken or transient views are human: they are not [1]
governed by the Principle of divine Science: but the
notion that a mind governed by Principle can be forced
into personal channels, affinities, self-interests, or obliga-
tions, is a grave mistake; it dims the true sense of God's [5]
reflection, and darkens the understanding that demon-
strates above personal motives, unworthy aims and
ambitions.

Too much and too little is attached to me as authority
for other people's thoughts and actions. A tacit acqui- [10]
escence with others' views is often construed as direct
orders,--or at least it so appears in results. I desire
the equal growth and prosperity of all Christian Scien-
tists, and the world in general; each and every one has
equal opportunity to be benefited by my thoughts and [15]
writings. If any are not partakers thereof, this is not
my fault, and is far from my desire; the possible per-
version of Christian Science is the irony of fate, if the
spirit thereof be lacking. I would part with a blessing
myself to bestow it upon others, but could not deprive [20]
them of it. False views, however engendered, relative
to the true and unswerving course of a Christian Scientist,
will at length dissolve into thin air. The dew of heaven
will fall gently on the hearts and lives of all who are found
worthy to suffer for righteousness,--and have taught [25]
the truth which is energizing, refreshing, and consecrat-
ing mankind.

To station justice and gratitude as sentinels along the
lines of thought, would aid the solution of this problem,
and counteract the influence of envious minds or the mis- [30]
guided individual who keeps not watch over his emotions
and conclusions.

[Page 292.]




New Commandment


The divinity of St. John's Gospel brings to view over- [1]
whelming tides of revelation, and its spirit is baptismal;
he chronicles this teaching, "A new commandment I
give unto you, That ye love one another." [5]

Jesus, who so loved the world that he gave his life
(in the flesh) for it, saw that Love had a new command-
ment even for him. What was it?

It must have been a rare revelation of infinite Love, a
new tone on the scale ascending, such as eternity is ever [10]
sounding. Could I impart to the student the higher
sense I entertain of Love, it would partly illustrate the
divine energy that brings to human weakness might and
majesty. Divine Love eventually causes mortals to turn
away from the open sepulchres of sin, and look no more [15]
into them as realities. It calls loudly on them to bury
the dead out of sight; to forgive and forget whatever is
unlike the risen, immortal Love; and to shut out all op-
posite sense. Christ enjoins it upon man to help those
who know not what he is doing in their behalf, and there- [20]
fore curse him; enjoins taking them by the hand and
leading them, if _possible_, to Christ, by loving words and
deeds. Charity thus serves as admonition and instruc-
tion, and works out the purposes of Love.

Christian Science, full of grace and truth, is accom- [25]
plishing great good, both seen and unseen; but have
mortals, with the penetration of Soul, searched the secret
chambers of sense? I never knew a student who fully
understood my instructions on this point of handling
evil,--as to just how this should be done,--and carried [30]

[Page 293.]

out my ideal. It is safe not to teach prematurely the [1]
infant thought in Christian Science--just breathing new
Life and Love--all the claims and modes of evil; there-
fore it is best to leave the righteous unfolding of error
(as a general rule) alone, and to the special care of the [5]
unerring modes of divine wisdom. This uncovering and
punishing of sin must, will come, at some date, to the
rescue of humanity. The teacher of divine metaphysics
should impart to his students the general knowledge that
he has gained from instruction, observation, and mental [10]
practice.

Experience weighs in the scales of God the sense and
power of Truth against the opposite claims of error.
If spiritual sense is not dominant in a student, he will
not understand all your instructions; and if evil domi- [15]
nates his character, he will pervert the rules of Christian
Science, and the last error will be worse than the first--
inasmuch as wilful transgression brings greater torment
than ignorance.




A Cruce Salus


The sum total of Love reflected is exemplified, and [21]
includes the whole duty of man: Truth perverted, in
belief, becomes the creator of the claim of error. To
affirm mentally and audibly that God is All and there is
no sickness and no sin, makes mortals either saints or [25]
sinners.

Truth talked and not lived, rolls on the human heart
a stone; consigns sensibility to the charnel-house of sen-
suality, ease, self-love, self-justification, there to moulder
and rot. [30]

[Page 294.]

The noblest work of God is man in the image of his [1]
Maker; the last infirmity of evil is so-called man, swayed
by the maelstrom of human passions, elbowing the con-
cepts of his own creating, making place for himself and
displacing his fellows. [5]

A real Christian Scientist is a marvel, a miracle in the
universe of mortal mind. With selfless love, he inscribes
on the heart of humanity and transcribes on the page
of reality the living, palpable presence--the might and
majesty!--of goodness. He lives for all mankind, and [10]
honors his creator.

The _vice versa_ of this man is sometimes called a
man, but he is a small animal: a hived bee, with sting
ready for each kind touch, he makes honey out of
the flowers of human hearts and hides it in his cell of [15]
ingratitude.

O friendly hand! keep back thy offerings from asps
and apes, from wolves in sheep's clothing and all raven-
ing beasts. Love such specimens of mortality just enough
to reform and transform them,--if it be possible,-- [20]
and then, look out for their stings, and jaws, and claws;
but thank God and take courage,--that you desire to
help even such as these.
