                                    I

    O woeful hour! when from the night
    Emerged in wrath Satanic might,
    To crush the Christ, whom God in heaven,
    To raise our fallen race, had given.

                                   II

    O woeful hour! when, with the scorn
    Of sinful men, His soul was torn;
    When sin exulting bowed the knee,
    And stung the Christ with mockery.

                                   III

    O woeful hour! when to the tree
    The Christ was nailed in agony;
    When anguish for our sin He bore,
    And thorns His throbbing temples tore.

                                   IV

    O woeful hour! O darkest day!
    The God-Man, still, entombed lay,
    For death his cruel shaft had driven
    To quell the hope our God had given.

                                    V

    O saddened soul! the night is past,
    The morn, bright morn, has come at last;
    The rage of sin its worst hath done,
    Yet lives in power th' eternal Son.

                                   VI

    The dark hath vanished in the light;
    O futile now, Satanic might;
    Sin wounded lies, and death is slain
    By Him who lives in power again.

                                   VII

    Hail, glorious morn! the Christ hath risen;
    Hail Victor from the darkest prison!
    Up, up, my soul! thy praises pour
    To Christ, Thy God, for evermore.




                                    I

    Crown the Lord of glory,
      Angels, crown your King;
    Saints whose souls He ransomed,
      Bring your offering;
    Let no voice be silent,
      Laud and honour bring.

                                   II

    Crown the Lord of glory,--
      Once He dwelt below,
    Bore the cross of sorrow,
      Drank the cup of woe;
    Now He reigns triumphant,
      Let your praises flow.

                                   III

    Crown the Lord of glory,--
      On the earth He wore
    Purple robe that mocked Him,
      Thorns His brow that tore;
    Now His griefs are ended,
      Praise Him evermore.

                                   IV

    Crown the Lord of glory,
      For His work is done;
    Crown the King of glory,
      God's eternal Son;
    In my life enthroned,
      Be Thy reign begun!




                                    I

    O Christ, when on the shameful tree,
    Thou bor'st such cruel pain for me,
    Thine every member felt the smart,
    And sent its sorrows to Thy heart.

                                   II

    A crown of thorns Thy temples tore,
    Thy face, O Christ, vile spittings bore,
    And cruel hands, O action base!
    Smote Thee, defiant, in the face.

                                   III

    When in Thy thirst, men heard Thee call,
    Thy lips were drenched with bitter gall;
    And to Thine ears the words were borne
    Of blasphemy and ribald scorn.

                                   IV

    Thy hands and feet with nails were riven,
    The spear into Thy side was driven;--
    O Christ, when dying on the tree,
    How great the pain Thou bor'st for me!

                                    V

    Now, by Thy Cross, Almighty King,
    Salvation to the sinner bring,
    And let Thy sacrifice for me
    Teach me to sacrifice for Thee.




                                    I

    O God of love, whose mercy came
    To this dark world of sin and shame,
    And on a Cross of suffering sore,
    That sin and shame in meekness bore.

                                   II

    Supreme the love the Christ displayed,
    When He, True God, True Man was made;
    When He was scorned, His patience then
    Shone forth divine, with sinful men.

                                   III

    Did e'er such mercy lead the great
    To stoop from high to low estate?
    Did e'er such love incline the heart
    To take the erring sinner's part?

                                   IV

    'Twas God who loved, 'twas God who gave
    His Son our erring souls to save;
    'Tis Christ that wins us by the love
    From earth below to heaven above.

                                    V

    Win me, O Lord, whose mercy came
    To this dark world of sin and shame,
    To that bright world whose beauties shine
    Forever in Thy love divine.

                                   VI

    To Thee, O Father, glory be,
    And glory, Christ, God-Man, to Thee,
    And to the Spirit, Three in One,
    Now, and while countless ages run.




                                    I

    When Hades held the Lord of Life,
      The boast of sin was vaunting high;
    'Twas much to wound a sinless soul,
      But more to see the God-Man die.

                                   II

    When Hades held the Lord of Life,
      The gates were barred to hold Him fast.
    No prison bars so closely drawn
      Were e'er by soul of mortal passed.

                                   III

    When Hades held the Lord of Life,
      Rejoicing, death beheld Him there;--
    "Now close the ancient barriers draw,
      And drive the prisoner to despair."

                                   IV

    O, blank surprise when Hades shook!
      O, ringing joy through all the gloom!
    Asunder fell the gates of night,
      And rose the Conqueror from the tomb.

                                    V

    Immortal Saviour! death is dead,
      No more it holds the souls of men;
    For Thou hast crushed the power of sin,
      And brought us back to life again.




                                    I

    When Thou, O Christ, upon the tree,
      Wert bearing pain for sinful men,
    The sun, lamenting, hid his face,
      And clothed himself with darkness then;

                                   II

    And o'er the world, when noontide came,
      The light grew faint and faded soon;
    And men in wonder saw the dark
      Bring in the night at hour of noon.

                                   III

    But, low in Hades' depths there shone
      Such light as never shone before;
    And prisoners saw the Light of lights,
      And joyed to feel their bondage o'er.

                                   IV

    O blessed art Thou, Christ, our Lord,
      For all the pain so meekly borne;
    The dark that hid Thee in Thy woe,
      Has ushered in a glorious morn.




                                    I

    To Thy Cross and Resurrection,
      Laud and praise we humbly give;
    In Thy death and life immortal,
      We will die, and ever live.

                                   II

    Christ Incarnate! by Thy Manhood,
      Thou to God hast brought me nigh;
    Christ the humble! by Thy meekness,
      Thou hast raised my horn on high.

                                   III

    Source of life! O Christ, the anguish
      Borne upon the cruel tree
    Lifts me to the bliss abiding,
      Where from suffering, souls are free.

                                   IV

    Endless praises, bright and thankful,
      Christ, to Thee be ever given,
    By the souls in sorrow singing,
      By the souls redeemed in heaven.




                                    I

    Light is dawning 'mong the hills,
      Light of light Thy beams display,
      All the darkness chase away,
    Light that dawned upon our ills.

                                   II

    Dark the day the Cross was raised
