           It does not seem necessary to take the language of the mele
           literally. The sufferings that the person in the mele
           describes in the first person, it seems to the author, may be
           those of his friend Lohiau; and the first person is used for
           literary effect.

                Alas, there's no stay to the smoke;
                I must die mid the quenchless flame--
                Deed of the hag who snores in her sleep,
                Bedded on lava plate oven-hot.
            5   Now it takes the shape of canoe;
[Page 196]      Seats at the bow and amidships,
                And the steersman sitting astern;
                Their stroke stirs the ocean to foam--
                The myth-craft, Kau-meli-eli!
           10   Now look, the white gleam of an eye--
                It is Niheu, the turbulent one--
                An eye like the white sandy shore.
                Amen, possess me!

           [Footnote 350: The remarks on pp. 194 and 195 regarding the mele
           on p. 194 are mostly applicable to this mele.]

           [Footnote 351: _Kau-meli-eli_. The name of the double canoe
           which brought a company of the gods from the lands of the
           South--Kukulu o Kahiki--to Hawaii. Hawaiian myths refer to
           several migrations of the gods to Hawaii; one of them is that
           described in the mele given on p. 187, the first mele in this
           chapter.]

           The mele now to be given has the form of a serenade.
           Etiquette forbade anyone to wake the king by rude touch, but
           it was permissible for a near relative to touch his feet.
           When the exigencies of business made it necessary for a
           messenger, a herald, or a courtier to disturb the sleeping
           monarch, he took his station at the king's feet and recited a
           serenade such as this:

           [Footnote 352: Hawaiians conceived of the dome of heaven as a
           solid structure supported by walls that rested on the earth's
           plain. Different names were given to different sections of
           the wall. _Kahiki-ku_ and _Kahiki-moe_ were names applied to
           certain of these sections. It would, however, be too much, to
           expect any Hawaiian, however intelligent and well versed in
           old lore, to indicate the location of these regions.]

           [Footnote 353: The words _apapa nu'u_ and _apapa lani_, which
           convey to the mind of the author the picture of a series of
           terraced plains or steppes--no doubt the original
           meaning--here mean a family or order of gods, not of the
           highest rank, at or near the head of which stood Pele.
           Apropos of this subject the following lines have been quoted:

                Hanau ke apapa nu'u:
                Hanau ke apapa lani;
                Hanau Pele, ka hihi'o na lani.

                         [Translation]

                Begotten were the gods of graded rank;
                Begotten were the gods of heavenly rank;
                Begotten was Pele, quintessence of heaven.

           This same expression was sometimes used to mean an order of
           chiefs, _alii. Apapa lani_ was also used to mean the highest
           order of gods, _Ku, Kane, Kanaloa, Lono_. The kings also were
           gods, for which reason this expression at times applied to
           the alii of highest rank, those, for instance, who inherited
           the rank of _niau-pi'o_ or of _wohi._]

           [Footnote 354: _Lani_. Originally the heavens, came to mean
           king, chief, _alii_.]

           [Footnote 355: There is a difference of opinion as to the
           meaning of _Kape'a ma_. After hearing diverse opinions the
           author concludes that it refers to the rays of the sun that
           precede its rising--a Greek idea.]

           [Footnote 356: _Unulau_. A name for the trade-wind which, owing
           to the conformation of the land, often sweeps down with great
           force through the deep valleys that seam the mountains of
           west Maui between Lahaina and Maalaea bay; such a wind squall
           was called a _mumuku_.]

           [Footnote 357: _Ukumehame_. The name of a deep valley on west
           Maui in the region above described.]

           [Footnote 358: _Papawai_. The principal cape on west Maui
           between Lahaina and Maalaea bay.]

           [Footnote 359: _Kumu-kahi_. A cape in Puna, the easternmost
           part of Hawaii; by some said to be the sun's wife, and the
           object of his eager pursuit after coming out of his eastern
           gate Ha'eha'e. The name was also applied to a pillar of stone
           that was planted on the northern border of this cape.
           Standing opposite to it, on the southern side, was the
           monolith Makanoni. In summer the sun in its northern
           excursion inclined, as the Hawaiians noted, to the side of
           Kumukahi, while in the season of cool weather, called
           Makalii, it swung in the opposite direction and passed over
           to Makanoni. The people of Puna accordingly said, "The sun
           has passed over to Makanoni," or "The sun has passed over to
           Kumukahi," as the case might be. These two pillars are said
           to be of such a form as to suggest the thought that they are
           phallic emblems, and this conjecture is strengthened by
           consideration of the tabus connected with them and of the
           religious ceremonies peformed before them. The Hawaiians
           speak of them as _pohaku eho_, which, the author believes,
           is the name given to a phallus, and describe them as plain
           uncarved pillars.

           These stones were set up in very ancient times and are said
           to have been tabu to women at the times of their infirmity.
           If a woman climbed upon them at such a period or even set
           foot upon the platform on which one of them stood she was put
           to death. Another stringent tabu forbade anyone to perform an
           office of nature while his face was turned toward one of
           these pillars.

           The language of the mele, _Ke hahai ae la e like me Kumukahi_
           (verse 16), implies that the sun chased after Kumukahi.
           Apropos of this is the following quotation from an article on
           the phallus in Chambers's Encyclopedia: "The common myth
           concerning it [the phallus] was the story of some god
           deprived of his power of generation--an allusion to the sun,
           which in autumn loses its fructifying influence."

           In modern times there seems to have grown up a curious
           mixture of traditions about these two stones, in which the
           old have become overlaid with new superstitions; and these
           last in turn seem to be dying out. They are now vaguely
           remembered as relics of old demigods, petrified forms of
           ancient _kupua_.[360] Fishermen, it is said, not long ago
           offered sacrifices to them, hoping thus to purchase good
           luck. Any offense against them, such as that by women, above
           mentioned, or by men, was atoned for by offering before these
           ancient monuments the first fish that came to the fisherman's
           hook or net.

           Mention of the name Kumu-kahi to a Hawaiian versed in ancient
           lore called up to his memory the name of Pala-moa as his
           associate. The account this old man gave of them was that
           they were demigods much worshiped and feared for their power
           and malignity. They were reputed to be cannibals on the sly,
           and, though generally appearing in human form, were capable
           of various metamorphoses, thus eluding detection. They were
           believed to have the power of taking possession of men
           through spiritual obsession, as a result of which the
           obsessed ones were enabled to heal sickness as well as to
           cause it, to reveal secrets, and to Inflict death, thus
           terrifying people beyond measure. The names of these, two
           demigods, especially that of Palamoa, are to this day
           appealed to by practitioners of the black arts.]

           [Footnote 360: The Hawaiian alphabet had no letter _s_. The
           Hawaiians indicated the plural by prefixing the particle
           _na_.]

           [Footnote 361: _Maull-ola_. A god of health; perhaps also the
           name of a place. The same word also was applied to the breath
           of life, or to the physician's power of healing. In the Maori
           tongue the word _mauri_, corresponding to _mauli_, means
           life, the seat of life. In Samoan the word _mauli_ means
           heart. "Sneeze, living heart" (_Tihe mauri ora_), says the
           Maori mother to her infant when it sneezes. For this bit of
           Maori lore acknowledgment is due to Mr. S. Percy Smith, of
           New Zealand.]

           [Footnote 362: According to one authority, at the close of the
           first canto the stranger gods--_akua malihini_--who consisted
           of that multitude of godlings called the _Kini Akua_, took
           their departure from the ceremony, since they did not belong
           to the Pele family. Internal evidence, however, the study of
           the prayer itself in its two parts, leads the writer to
           disagree with this authority. Other Hawaiians of equally
           deliberate judgment support him in this opinion. The
           etiquette connected with ceremonious awa-drinking, which the
           Samoans of to-day still maintain in full form, long ago died
           out in Hawaii. This etiquette may never have been cultivated
           here to the same degree as in its home, Samoa; but this poem
           is evidence that the ancient Hawaiians paid greater attention
           to it than they of modern times. The reason for this decline
           of ceremony must be sought for in the mental and esthetic
           make-up of the Hawaiian people; it was not due to any lack of
           fondness in the Hawaiian for awa as a beverage or as an
           intoxicant. It is no help to beg the question by ascribing
           the decline of this etiquette to the influence of social
           custom. To do so would but add one more link to the chain
           that binds cause to effect. The Hawaiian mind was not
           favorable to the observance of this sort of etiquette; it did
           not afford a soil fitted to nourish such an artificial
           growth.]

           [Footnote 363: The meaning of the word _Ku-ka-la-ula_ presented
           great difficulty and defied all attempts at translation until
           the suggestion was made by a bright Hawaiian, which was
           adopted with satisfaction, that it probably referred to that
           state of dreamy mental exaltation which comes with
           awa-intoxication. This condition, like that of frenzy, of
           madness, and of idiocy, the Hawaiian regarded as a divine
           possession.]

                    Of the goddess of Kilauea;
                    She who dug the pit world-deep,
                    And Mau-wahine and Kupu-ena,
                    Who prepare the awa for drink.
               15   A health to the stranger gods!

                                  CANTO II

                    Bedeck now the board for the feast;
                    Fill up the last bowl to the brim;
                    Then pour a draught in the sun-cave
                    Shall flow to the mellow haze,
               20   That tints the land of the gods.

                    All hail to the stranger gods!
                    This my offering, simply a voice,
                    Only a welcoming voice.
                    Turn in!
               25   Lo, the feast!



           This prayer, though presented in two parts or cantos, is
           really one, its purpose being to offer a welcome, _kanaenae_,
           to the feast and ceremony to the gods who had a right to
           expect that courtesy.

           One more mele of the number specially used in the hula Pele:

                          _Mele_

                    Nou paha e, ka inoa

                    E hapa-hapai a'e;
                5   A pa i ke kihi
                    O Ki-lau-e-a.
                    Ilaila ku'u kama,
                    O Ku-nui-akea.[364]
                    Hookomo a'e iloko
               10   A o Hale-ma'u-ma'u;[365]
                    A ma-u na pu'u
                    E ola-ola, nei.
                    E kulipe'e nui ai-ahua.[366]
                    E Pele, e Pele!
               15   E Pele, e Pele!
                    Huai'na! huai'na!
                    Ku ia ka lani,
                    Pae a huila!

           [Footnote 364: Kalakaua, for whom all these fine words are
           intended, could no more claim kinship with Ku-nui-akea, the
           son of Kau-i-ke-aouli, than with Julius Caesar.]

           [Footnote 365: _Hale-mau-mau_. Used figuratively of the mouth,
           whose hairy fringe--moustache and beard--gives it a fancied
           resemblance to the rough lava pit where Pele dwelt. The
           figure, to us no doubt obscure, conveyed to the Hawaiian the
           idea of trumpeting the name and making it famous.]

           [Footnote 366: _E kuli-pe'e nui ai-ahua_. Pele is here figured
           as an old, infirm woman, crouching and crawling along; a
           character and attitude ascribed to her, no doubt, from the
           fancied resemblance of a lava flow, which, when in the form
           of _a-a_, rolls and tumbles along over the surface of the
           ground in a manner suggestive of the motions and attitude of
           a palsied crone.]

                          _Song_

                Yours, doubtless, this name.
                Which people are toasting
                With loudest acclaim.
                Now raise it, aye raise it,
            5   Till it reaches the niches
                Of Ki-lau-e-a.
                Enshrined is there my kinsman,
                Ku-nui-akea.
                Then give it a place
           10   In the temple of Pele;
                And a bowl for the throats
                That are croaking with thirst.
                Knock-kneed eater of land,
                O Pele, god Pele!
           15   O Pele, god Pele!
                Burst forth now! burst forth!
                Launch a bolt from the sky!
                Let thy lightnings fly:

           When this poem[367] first came into the author's hands, though
           attracted by its classic form and vigorous style, he could
           not avoid being repelled by an evident grossness. An old
           Hawaiian, to whom he stated his objections, assured him that
           the mele was innocent of all bad intent, and when the
           offensive word was pointed out he protested that it was an
           interloper. The substitution of the right word showed that
           the man was correct. The offense was at once removed. This
           set the whole poem in a new light and it is presented with
           satisfaction. The mele is properly a name-song, _mele-inoa_.
           The poet represents some one as lifting a name to his mouth
           for praise and adulation. He tells him to take it to
           Kilauea--that it may reecho, doubtless, from the walls of the
           crater.

           [Footnote 367: It is said to ue the work of a hula-master, now
           some years dead, by the name of Namakeelua.]

                          XXV.--THE HULA PA'I-UMAUMA


           The hula _pa'i-umauma_--chest-beating hula--called also hula
           _Pa-lani_,[368] was an energetic dance, in which the actors, who
           were also the singers, maintained a kneeling position, with
           the buttocks at times resting on the heels. In spite of the
           restrictions imposed by this attitude, they managed to put a
           spirited action into the performance; there were vigorous
           gestures, a frequent smiting of the chest with the open hand,
           and a strenuous movement of the pelvis and lower part of the
           body called _ami_. This consisted of rhythmic motions,
           sidewise, backward, forward, and in a circular or elliptical
           orbit, all of which was done with the precision worthy of an
           acrobat, an accomplishment attained only after long practice.
           It was a hula of classic celebrity, and was performed without
           the accompaniment of instrumental music.

           [Footnote 368: _Palani_, French, so called at Moanalua because
           a woman who was its chief exponent was a Catholic, one of the
           "poe Palani." Much odium has been laid to the charge of the
           hula on account of the supposed indecency of the motion
           termed _ami_. There can be no doubt that the ami was at times
           used to represent actions unfit for public view, and so far
           the blame is just. But the ami did not necessarily nor always
           represent obscenity, and to this extent the hula has been
           unjustly maligned.]

           In the mele now to be given the poet calls up a succession of
           pictures by imagining himself in one scenic position after
           another, beginning at Hilo and passing in order from one
           island to another--omitting, however, Maui--until he finds
           himself at Kilauea, an historic and traditionally interesting
           place on the windward coast of the garden-island, Kauai. The
           order of travel followed by the poet forbids the supposition
           that the Kilauea mentioned is the great caldera of the
           volcano on Hawaii in which Pele had her seat.

           It is useless to regret that the poet did not permit his muse
           to tarry by the way long enough to give us something more
           than a single eyeshot at the quickly shifting scenes which
           unrolled themselves before him, that so he might have given
           us further reminiscence of the lands over which his Pegasus
           bore him. Such completeness of view, however, is alien to the
           poesy of Hawaii.

                At Hilo I rendezvoused with, the lehua;
                By the Wailuku stream, near the robber-den;
                Off cape Lele-iwi I swam in the ocean;
                At Pana-ewa, mid groves of lehua;
            5   At Ha-ili, a forest of flocking birds.
                On Molokai I travel its one highway;
                I saw the plain of Kala'e quiver with heat,
                And beheld the ax-quarries of Mauna-loa.
                Ah, the perfume Nihoa's pandanus exhales!
           10   Ko'i-ahi, home of the small-leafed maile;
                And now at Makua, lo, its virgin sand,
                While ocean surges and scours on below.
                Lo, a woman crouched on the shore by the sea,
                In the brick-red bowl, Kilauea's bay.
