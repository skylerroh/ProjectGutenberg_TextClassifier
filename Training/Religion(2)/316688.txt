
    "The young lambs bleat and frisk about,
      The bees hum round their hive,
    The butterflies are coming out,--
      'Tis good to be alive.

    "The trees that looked so stiff and gray
      With green wreaths now are hung;
    O mother! let me laugh and play,
      I cannot hold my tongue.

    "See yonder bird spread out his wings,
      And mount the clear blue skies;
    And hark! how merrily he sings,
      As far away he flies."

    "Go forth, my child, and laugh and play,
      And let your cheerful voice,
    With birds, and brooks, and merry May,
      Cry loud, Rejoice! rejoice!

    "I would not check your bounding mirth,
      My little happy boy,
    For He who made this blooming earth
      Smiles on an infant's joy."


GUESS WHAT I HAVE HEARD.

    Dear mother, guess what I have heard!
      O, it will soon be spring!
    I'm sure it was a little bird,--
      Mother, I heard him sing.

    Look at this little piece of green
      That peeps out from the snow,
    As if it wanted to be seen,--
      'Twill soon be spring, I know.

    And O, come here, come here and look!
      How fast it runs along!--
    Here is a cunning little brook;
      O, hear its pretty song!

    I know 'tis glad the winter's gone
      That kept it all so still,
    For now it merrily runs on,
      And goes just where it will.

    I feel just like the brook, I know;
      It says, it seems to me,--
    "Good by, cold weather, ice, and snow;
      Now girls and brooks are free."

    I love to think of what you said,
      Mother, to me last night,
    Of this great world that God has made,
      So beautiful and bright.

    And now it is the happy spring
      No naughty thing I'll do;
    I would not be the only thing
      That is not happy, too.


SPRING.

    Hark! the little birds are singing,--
      Winter's gone and summer's near;
    See, the tender grass is springing,
      And the flowers will soon be here.

    Who made the winter and the spring?
      Who painted all the flowers?
    Who taught the little birds to sing,
      And made these hearts of ours?

    O, 'tis God! how good he is!
      He does every blessing give;
    All this happy world is his,--
      Let us love him while we live.


THE LITTLE BOY'S GOOD-NIGHT.

    The sun is hidden from our sight,
      The birds are sleeping sound;
    'Tis time to say to all, "Good night!"
      And give a kiss all round.

    Good night! my father, mother, dear,
      Now kiss your little son;
    Good night! my friends, both far and near,
      Good night to every one.

    Good night! ye merry, merry birds,
      Sleep well till morning light;
    Perhaps if you could sing in words,
      You would have said, "Good night!"

    To all my pretty flowers, good night!
      You blossom while I sleep;
    And all the stars, that shine so bright,
      With you their watches keep.

    The moon is lighting up the skies,
      The stars are sparkling there;
    'Tis time to shut our weary eyes,
      And say our evening prayer.


THE SHEPHERD'S SABBATH-SONG.

TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN OF UHLAND.

      This is the Sabbath day!
    In the wide field I am alone.
    Hark! now one morning bell's sweet tone,--
      Now it has died away.

      Kneeling I worship Thee;
    Sweet dread doth o'er my spirit steal,
    From whispering sounds of those who kneel,
      Unseen, to pray with me.

      Around and far away,
    So clear and solemn is the sky,
    It seems all opening to my eye;
      This is the Sabbath day!


TO SPRING.

    Hail! reviving, joyous Spring,
      Smiling through thy veil of showers;
    Birds and brooks thy welcome sing,--
      Haste, and waken all thy flowers.

    Hark! a sweet pervading sound!
      From the breathing, moving earth
    Life is starting all around,
      Sending joy and fragrance forth.

    O'er the oak's gigantic form
      Blossoms hang their drapery;
    Branches that defied the storm
      Now are full of melody.

    There is not a silent thing
      In this joyous company;
    Woods, and hills, and valleys ring
      With a shout of jubilee.

    Wake, my spirit! art thou still?
      Senseless things have found a voice;
    Shall this throbbing heart be still,
      When all nature cries, "Rejoice"?

    Wake, come forth, my bounding soul!
      Join the universal glee,
    Yield to nature's kind control,
      Catch her heavenly harmony.

    Join the grateful, happy throng,
      Cast each selfish care away;
    Birds and brooks shall tune your song;
      This is nature's holiday.


HER VOYAGE IS AT AN END.

    Hushed was the ocean's stormy roar,
      Still as an infant's joy;
    There sat upon the rocky shore
      A father and his boy.

    Far off they saw a gallant ship,
      It came from foreign lands;
    The boy began to dance and skip,
      And clap his little hands.

    Her wished-for port is near at hand,
      The ship is hastening on;
    They hear the birds sing on the land;
      Her voyage is nearly done.

    The boy's glad notes, his shouts of glee,
      The rocks with music fill;
    But now he cries,--"See, father, see!
      The ship is standing still."

    Her masts are trembling from the shock.
      Her white sails all descend;
    The ship has struck upon a rock,--
      Her voyage is at an end.

    The sailors hurry to and fro,
      All crowded is the deck;
    She struggles hard,--she's free;--O, no!
      She is indeed a wreck.

    The boy's young heart is full of grief:
      "Father! what will she do?
    Let's take the boat to her relief,
      O, quickly let us go!"

    They went,--and many a stronger hand
      Its ready succour gave;
    They brought the crew all safe to land,
      And the cargo tried to save.

    The night comes on, the night is dark,
      More dark the billows seem;
    They break against the ship, and hark!
      The seamew's mournful scream.

    The boy upon his pillow lies,
      In sweet repose he sinks;
    And, as he shuts his weary eyes,
      On the poor ship he thinks.

    The sun shines o'er the watery main
      As it did the day before;
    The father and his son again
      Are seated on the shore.

    With the western wind full many a boat
      Their white sails gayly fill,
    They lightly o'er the blue waves float,--
      But the gallant ship is still.

    The sailors now the mournful wreck
      Of masts and rigging strip;
    The waves are playing o'er the deck
      Of the sad and ruined ship.

    A crow upon the top branch stood
      Of a lone and blasted tree;
    He seemed to look upon the flood
      With a gloomy sympathy.

    The boy now looks up at the bird,
      At the sinking vessel now;
    He does not speak a single word.
      But a shade is on his brow.

    Now slowly comes a towering wave,
      And sweeps with triumph on;
    It bears her to her watery grave,--
      The gallant ship is gone.

    Hushed is the ocean's stormy roar,
      Still as an infant's joy;
    The father sits upon the shore
      In silence with his boy.

CHARLEY AND HIS FATHER.

A BALLAD.

    The birds are flown away,
      The flowers are dead and gone,
    The clouds look cold and gray
      Around the setting sun.

    The trees with solemn sighs
      Their naked branches swing;
    The winter winds arise,
      And mournfully they sing.

    Upon his father's knee
      Was Charley's happy place,
    And very thoughtfully
      He looked up in his face;

    And these his simple words:--
      "Father, how cold it blows!
    What 'comes of all the birds
      Amidst the storms and snows?"

    "They fly far, far away
      From storms, and snows, and rain;
    But, Charley dear, next May
      They'll all come back again."

    "And will my flowers come, too?"
      The little fellow said,
    "And all be bright and new,
      That now looks cold and dead?"

    "O, yes, dear; in the spring
      The flowers will all revive,
    The birds return and sing,
      And all be made alive."

    "Who shows the birds the way,
      Father, that they must go?
    And brings them back in May,
      When there is no more snow?

    "And when no flower is seen
      Upon the hill and plain,
    Who'll make it all so green,
      And bring the flowers again?"

    "My son, there is a Power
      That none of us can see
    Takes care of every flower,
      Gives life to every tree.

    "He through the pathless air
      Shows little birds their way;
    And we, too, are his care,--
      He guards us day by day."

    "Father, when people die,
      Will they come back in May?"
    Tears were in Charley's eye,--
      "Will they, dear father, say?"

    "No! they will never come;
      We go to them, my boy,
    There, in our heavenly home,
      To meet in endless joy."

    Upon his father's knee
      Still Charley kept his place,
    And very thoughtfully
      He looked up in his face.


REMEMBER THE SLAVE.

    Mother! whene'er around your child
      You clasp your arms in love,
    And when, with grateful joy, you raise
      Your eyes to God above,

    Think of the negro mother, when
      Her child is torn away,
    Sold for a little slave,--O, then
      For that poor mother pray!

    Father! whene'er your happy boys
      You look upon with pride,
    And pray to see them when you're old,
      All blooming by your side,

    Think of that father's withered heart,
      The father of a slave,
    Who asks a pitying God to give
      His little son a grave.

    Brothers and sisters! who with joy
      Meet round the social hearth,
    And talk of home and happy days,
      And laugh in careless mirth,
