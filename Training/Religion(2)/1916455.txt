
2 At some time or other
  The Lord will provide;
It may not be my time,
It may not be thy time,
And yet in his own time,
  The Lord will provide.

3 Despond then no longer,
  The Lord will provide;
And this be the token--
No word he hath spoken,
Was ever yet broken,
  The Lord will provide.

4 March on, then, right boldly
  The sea shall divide;
The pathway made glorious
With shoutings victorious,
We'll join in the chorus,
  The Lord will provide.

_Heb. 12:2._     (866)

Oh, eyes that are weary, and hearts that are sore!
Look off unto Jesus, now sorrow no more!
The light of his countenance shineth so bright,
That here, as in heaven, there need be no night.

2 While looking to Jesus, my heart cannot fear;
I tremble no more when I see Jesus near;
I know that his presence my safeguard will be,
For, "Why are you troubled?" he saith unto me.

3 Still looking to Jesus, O, may I be found,
When Jordan's dark waters encompass me round!
They bear me away in his presence to be;
I see him still nearer whom always I see.

4 Then, then shall I know the full beauty and grace
Of Jesus, my Lord, when I stand face to face;
Shall know how his love went before me each day,
And wonder that ever my eyes turned away.


369     Foundation. 11s.

_Precious Promises._     (867)

How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in his excellent word:
What more can he say than to you he has said,
You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?

2 In every condition--in sickness, in health,
In poverty's vale, or abounding in wealth,
At home and abroad, on the land, on the sea--
As your days may demand, so your succor shall be.

3 Fear not: I am with you, O be not dismayed;
I, I am your God, and will still give you aid;
I'll strengthen you, help you, and cause you to stand,
Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.

4 When through the deep waters I cause you to go,
The rivers of sorrow shall not you o'erflow;
For I will be with you, your troubles to bless,
And sanctify to you your deepest distress.

5 When through fiery trials your pathway shall lie,
My grace, all-sufficient, shall be your supply;
The flame shall not hurt you; I only design
Your dross to consume, and your gold to refine.

6 E'en down to old age all my people shall prove
My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;
And when hoary hairs shall their temples adorn,
Like lambs they shall still in my bosom be borne.

7 The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,
I will not, I cannot desert to his foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
I'll never, no never, no never forsake.

Safe in the arms of Jesus,

Only a few more trials,
  Only a few more tears!

3 Jesus, my heart's dear refuge,
  Jesus has died for me;
Firm on the Rock of Ages
  Ever my trust shall be.
Here let me wait with patience,
  Wait till the night is o'er;
Wait till I see the morning
  Break on the golden shore.

Oh! words with heav'nly comfort fraught;
Whate'er I do, where'er I be,
Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

Ref.--He leadeth me! he leadeth me!
      By his own hand he leadeth me;
      His faithful follower I would be,
      For by his hand he leadeth me.

2 Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom,
Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,
By waters still, o'er troubled sea--
Still 'tis his hand that leadeth me.

3 Lord, I would clasp thy hand in mine.
Nor ever murmur or repine--
Content, whatever lot I see,
Since 'tis my God that leadeth me.

4 And when my task on earth is done,
When by thy grace, the vict'ry's won,
E'en death's cold wave I will not flee,
Since God thro' Jordan leadeth me.

My Jesus, as thou wilt--
  O may thy will be mine!
Into thy hand of love
  I would my all resign;
Through sorrow, or through joy,
  Conduct me as thine own,
And help me still to say,
  My Lord, thy will be done!

2 My Jesus, as thou wilt--
  If needy here and poor,
Give me thy people's bread,
  Their portion rich and sure;
The manna of thy word,
  Let my soul feed upon,
And, if all else should fail,
  My Lord, thy will be done!

3 My Jesus, as thou wilt--
  If among thorns I go,
Still sometimes here and there
  Let a few roses blow.
But thou, on earth, along
  The thorny path hast gone:
Then lead me after thee;
  My Lord, thy will be done!

  Trusting in the promise of the Savior;
And rejoice in hope, while I live or die,

I can smile at grief and abide in pain,
  Trusting in the promise of the Savior;
And the loss of all shall be highest gain,
  Trusting in the promise of the Savior.

  Trusting in the promise of the Savior;
Oh, the strength and grace only God can give,

  Trusting in the promise of the Savior;
And begin to walk in the holy way,
  Trusting in the promise of the Savior.

  Hope when all others die, fadeless and pure--
Here speaks the Comforter, in God's name saying,
  Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure.

  Forth from the throne of God, boundless in love;
Come to the feast prepared, come, ever knowing
  Earth has no sorrow but heaven can remove.

375     Follow On! P.M.

_Following Christ._

Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,
Where the flowers are blooming and the sweet waters flow;
Ev'rywhere he leads me I would follow, follow on,
Walking in his footsteps till the crown be won.

Ref.--Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!
        Anywhere, everywhere I would follow on!
      Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!
        Ev'rywhere he leads me I will follow on!

2 Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,
Where the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flow;
With his hand to lead me I will never, never fear,
Dangers cannot frighten me if my Lord is near.

3 Down in the valley, or upon the mountain steep,
Close beside my Savior would my soul ever keep;
He will lead me safely, in the path that he has trod,
Up to where they gather on the hills of God.

Till within the jasper wall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

_Divine Refuge._

The Lord's our Rock, in him we hide,

Cho.--Oh, Jesus is a Rock in a weary land,
        A weary land, a weary land,
      Oh, Jesus is a Rock in a weary land,
        A shelter in the time of storm.

No foes alarm, no fears affright,

  A shelter in the time of storm;
We'll never leave our safe retreat,
  A shelter in the time of storm.

4 O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,
  A shelter in the time of storm;
Be thou our helper, ever near,
  A shelter in the time of storm.

      I am safe from all danger
        While under his wings.

2 I dread not the terror by night,
  No arrow can harm me by day;
His shadow has covered me quite,

3 The pestilence walking about,
  When darkness has settled abroad,
Can never compel me to doubt
  The presence and power of God.

  No fearful foreboding can bring;
With Jesus my soul doth commune,
  His perfect salvation I sing.

  And ten thousand at my right hand;
Above me his wings are spread wide,
  Beneath them in safety I stand.

_Lead Thou Me On._

Lead, kindly Light, amid th' encircling gloom,
    Lead thou me on,
The night is dark, and I am far from home,
    Lead thou me on;
Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see
The distant scene; one step enough for me.

2 I was not ever thus, nor prayed that thou
    Shouldst lead me on;
I loved to choose and see my path, but now
    Lead thou me on;
I loved the garish day, and spite of fears,
Pride ruled my will. Remember not past years.

3 So long thy pow'r has blessed me, sure it still
    Will lead me on;
O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till
    The night is gone;
And with the morn those angel faces smile
Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.

  For joy cometh in the morning;
Oh, weeping mourner, dry your tears,
  For joy cometh in the morning.

And ev'ry trembling sinner hope,
  For joy cometh in the morning.

Sorrow and sighing flee away,
  For joy cometh in the morning.

_God's Tenderness in Our Grief._     (883)

How tender is thy hand,
  Oh, thou beloved Lord!
Afflictions come at thy command,
  And leave us at thy word.

2 How gentle was the rod
  That chastened us for sin!
How soon we found a smiling God,
  Where deep distress had been!

3 A Father's hand we felt,
  A Father's heart we knew;
With tears of penitence we knelt,
  And found his word was true.

4 We told him all our grief,
  We thought of Jesus' love;
A sense of pardon brought relief,
  And bade our pains remove.

_The Mercy-Seat._     (787)

From every stormy wind that blows,
From every swelling tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat;--
'Tis found before the mercy-seat.

2 There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads,--
A place, than all besides, more sweet;
It is the blood-bought mercy-seat.

3 There is a spot where spirits blend,
Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
Though sundered far, by faith they meet
Around one common mercy-seat.

4 There, there, on eagle's wings we soar,
And time, and sense seem all no more;
And heaven comes down our souls to greet,
And glory crowns the mercy-seat!

5 Oh! may my hand forget her skill,
My tongue be silent, cold, and still,
This bounding heart forget to beat,
If I forget the mercy-seat!

     Hugh Stowell, 1827.


385     Retreat. L.M.

_Design of Prayer._     (796)

Prayer is appointed to convey
  The blessings God designs to give:
Long as they live should Christians pray;
  They learn to pray when first they live.

2 If pain afflict or wrongs oppress;
  If cares distract, or fears dismay;
If guilt deject; if sin distress;
  In every case, still watch and pray.

3 'Tis prayer supports the soul that's weak,
  Tho' thought be broken, language lame,
Pray, if thou canst or canst not speak,
  But pray with faith in Jesus' name.

4 Depend on him, thou canst not fail;
  Make all thy wants and wishes known;
Fear not, his merits must prevail,
  Ask but in faith, it shall be done.

     Joseph Hart. _D._ 1768


386     Retreat. L.M.

_Psalm 104:34._     (794)

My God, is any hour so sweet
  From blush of morn to evening star,
As that which calls me to thy feet,
  The calm and holy hour of prayer?

2 Blest is the tranquil break of morn,
  And blest the hush of solemn eve,
When on the wings of prayer up-borne,
  This fair, but transient, world I leave.

3 Then is my strength by thee renewed;
  Then are my sins by thee forgiven;
Then dost thou cheer my solitude,
  With clear and beauteous hopes of heaven.
