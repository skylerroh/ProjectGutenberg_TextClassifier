                            (With distinct utterance)

                Kea-au shelters, Waiakea lies in the calm,
                The deep peace of King Hana-kahi.
                Hilo, of many diversions, swims in the ocean,
                'Tween Point Lele-iwi and Maka-hana-loa;
            5   And the village rests in the bowl,
                Its border surrounded with rain--
                Sharp from the sky the tooth of Hilo's rain.
                Trenched is the land, scooped out by the downpour--
                Tossed and like gnawing surf is Hilo's rain--
           10   Beach strewn with a tangle of thicket growth;
                A billowy freshet pours in Wailuku;
                Swoll'n is Wai-au, flooding the point Moku-pane;
                And red leaps the water of Anue-nue.
                A roar to heaven sends up Kolo-pule,
[Page 62]  15   Shaking like thunder, mist rising like smoke.
                The rain-cloud unfolds in the heavens;
                Dark grows Hilo, black with the rain.
                The skin of Hilo grows rough from the cold;
                The storm-cloud hangs low o'er the land.
           20   A rampart stand the woods of Haili;
                Ohi'as thick-set must be brushed aside,
                To tear one's way, like a covey of fowl,
                In the wilds of Pa-ie-ie--
                Lehua growths mine--heart of Mokau-lele.
           25   A breaking, a weaving of boughs, to shield from rain;
                A look enraptured on Hana-kahi,
                Sees Hilo astir, the blue ocean tossing
                Wind-thrown-spray--dear sea--'gainst Point Lele-iwi--
                A time-worn foam-wreath to encircle its brow.
           30   Look, Pu'u-eo! guard 'gainst the earth-rib!
                It's Puna-hoa reef; halt!
                At Waiakea halt!

                Ke'-au is a long strip of wildwood;
                Shag of pandanus mantles Pan'-ewa;
                Scraggy the branching of Laa's ohias;
                The lehua limbs at sixes and sevens--
            5   They are gray from the heat of the goddess.
[Page 63]       Puna smokes mid the bowling of rocks--
                Wood and rock the She-god heaps in confusion,
                The plain Oluea's one bed of live coals;
                Puna is strewn with fires clean to Apua,
           10   Thickets and tall trees a-blazing.
                Sweep on, oh fire-ax, thy flame-shooting flood!
                Smit by this ax is Ku-lili-kaua.
                It's a flood tide of lava clean to Kali'u,
                And the Sun, the light-giver, is conquered.
           15   The bones of wet Hilo rattle from drought;
                She turns for comfort to mountain, to sea,
                Fissured and broken, resolved into dust.

           This poem is taken from the story of Hiiaka. On her return
           from the journey to fetch Lohiau she found that her sister
           Pele had treacherously ravaged with fire Puna, the district
           that contained her own dear woodlands. The description given
           in the poem is of the resulting desolation.

           Hanalei valley, Kauai.]

           [Footnote 150: _Ma'alewa_. An aerial root that formed a sort
           of ladder by which one climbed the mountain steeps; literally
           a shaking sling.]

           [Footnote 151: _Moana-nui-ka-lehua_. A female demigod that came
           from the South (_Ku-kulu-o-Kahiki_) at about the same
           mythical period as that of Pele's arrival--If not in her
           company--and who was put in charge of a portion of the
           channel that lies between Kauai and Oahu. This channel was
           generally termed _Ie-ie-waena_ and _Ie-ie-waho_. Here the
           name _Moana-nui-ka-lehua_ seems to be used to indicate the
           sea as well as the demigoddess, whose dominion it was.
           Ordinarily she appeared as a powerful fish, but she was
           capable of assuming the form of a beautiful woman (mermaid?).
           The title _lehua_ was given her on account of her womanly
           charms.]

           [Footnote 152: _Mali'o_. Apparently another form of the word
           _malino_, calm; at any rate it has the same meaning.]

           [Footnote 153: _Lehua_. An allusion to the ill-fated' young
           woman Hopoe, who was Hiiaka's intimate friend. The allusion
           is amplified in the next line.]

           [Footnote 154: _Hopoe-lehua_. The lehua tree was one of the
           forms in which Hopoe appeared, and after her death, due to
           the jealous rage of Pele, she was turned into a charred lehua
           tree which stood on the coast subject to the beating of the
           surf.]

           [Footnote 155: _Maka'u ka lehua i ke kanaka_. Another version
           has it _Maka'u ke kanaka i ka lehua_; Man fears the lehua.
           The form here used is perhaps an ironical allusion to man's
           fondness not only to despoil the tree of its scarlet flowers,
           but womanhood, the woman it represented.]

           [Footnote 156: _Kea-au_. Often shortened in pronunciation to
           _Ke-au_, a fishing village in Puna near Hilo town. It now has
           a landing place for small vessels.]

           [Footnote 157: _Hoolono_. To call, to make an uproar, to spread
           a report.]

           [Footnote 158: _Ia hoo-nee-nee ia pili mai_. A very peculiar
           figure of speech. It Is as if the poet personified, the act
           of two lovers snuggling up close to each other. Compare with
           this the expression _No huli mai_, used by another poet in
           the thirteenth line of the lyric given on p. 204. The motive
           is the same in each case.]

           The author of this poem of venerable age is not known. It is
           spoken of as belonging to the _wa po_, the twilight of
           tradition. It is represented to be part of a mele taught to
           Hiiaka by her friend and preceptress in the hula, Hopoe.
           Hopoe is often called _Hopoe-wahine_. From internal evidence
           one can see that it can not be in form the same as was given
           to Hiiaka by Hopoe; it may have been founded on the poem of
           Hopoe. If so, it has been modified.

                From mountain retreat and root-woven ladder
                Mine eye looks down on goddess Moana-Lehua;
                I beg of the Sea, Be thou calm;
                Would there might stand on thy shore a lehua--
            5   Lehua-tree tall of Ho-poe.
                The lehua is fearful of man;
                It leaves him to walk on the ground below,
                To walk the ground far below.
                The pebbles at Ke'-au grind in the surf.
           10   The sea at Ke'-au shouts to Puna's palms,
                "Fierce is the sea of Puna."
                Move hither, snug close, companion mine;
                You lie so aloof over there.
                Oh what a bad fellow is cold!
           15   'Tis as if we were out on the wold;
                Our bodies so clammy and chill, friend!

           The last five verses, which sound like a love song, may
           possibly be a modern addition to this old poem. The sentiment
           they contain is comparable to that expressed in the Song of
           Welcome on page 39:

                Eia ka pu'u nui o waho nei, he anu.
                The hill of Affliction out there is the cold.

           [Footnote 159: _Hi'u-o-lani_. A very blind phrase. Hawaiians
           disagree as to its meaning. In the author's opinion, it is a
           word referring to the conjurer's art.]

           [Footnote 160: _Ua o Hilo_. Hilo is a very rainy country. The
           name Hilo seems to be used here as almost a synonym of
           violent rain. It calls to mind the use of the word Hilo to
           signify a strong wind:

           allusion to the fact, it is said, that in Hilo a rain-cloud,
           or rain-squall, as it came up would often divide and a part
           of it turn off toward Puna at the cape named Lele-iwi,
           one-half watering, in the direction of the present town, the
           land known as Hana-kahi.]

           should be Mauna-Hilo. Verses 13, 14, 16, and 17 are difficult
           of translation. The play on the words _ku a_, standing at, or
           standing by, and _kua_, the back; also on the word _kowa_, a
           gulf or strait; and the repetition of the word _mauna_,
           mountain--all this is carried to such an extent as to be
           quite unintelligible to the Anglo-Saxon mind, though full of
           significance to a Hawaiian.]

           [Footnote 165: _A'e_. A strong wind that prevails in Ka-u. The
           same word also means to step on, to climb. This
           double-meaning gives the poet opportunity for a euphuistic
           word-play that was much enjoyed by the Hawaiians. The

                Defying all strength with their violence.

                There's a storm when wind blows at Kau-na.
                Just look at the tempest there raging!
                Hono-malino sleeps sheltered by Kona.
           30   A eulogy this of a name.


           "What name?" was asked of the old Hawaiian.

           "A god," said he.

           "How is that? A mele-inoa celebrates the name and glory of a
           king, not of a god."
[Page 67]

           His answer was, "The gods composed the mele; men did not
           compose it."

           Like an old-time geologist, he solved the puzzle of a novel
           phenomenon by ascribing it to God.

           became distraught and wandered about for many months until

           This mele, _Hole Waimea_, is also sung in connection with the
           hula _ipu_.

           passionately. Waimea is a district and village on Hawaii.]

           blows at Waimea.]

           [Footnote 177: _Mahiki_. A woodland in Waimea, in mythological
           times haunted by demons and spooks.]

           [Footnote 178: _Mala-nai_. The poetical name of a wind,
           probably the trade wind; a name much used in Hawaiian
           sentimental poetry.]

           [Footnote 179: _Oha-wai_. A water hole that is filled by
           dripping; an important source of supply for drinking purposes
           in certain parts of Hawaii.]

           [Footnote 180: _Pua o Koaie_, The koaie is a tree that grows in
           the wilds, the blossom of which is extremely fragrant. (Not
           the same as that subspecies of the _koa_ (Acacia koa) which
           Hillebrand describes and wrongly spells _koaia_. Here a
           euphemism for the delicate parts.)]

           [Footnote 181: _Koolau_, or, full form, _Ko-kao-lau_. Described

           is sometimes used as a substitute for tea.)]

           [Footnote 182: _Moolau_. An expression used figuratively to
           mean a woman, more especially her breasts. The term

           breasts of a woman, the primitive meaning being a calabash.]

[Page 69]
           The song above given, the translation of which is to follow,
           belongs to historic times, being ascribed to King
           Liholiho--Kamehameha II--who died in London July 13, 1824, on
           his visit to England. It attained great vogue and still holds
           its popularity with the Hawaiians. The reader will note the
           comparative effeminacy and sentimentality of the style and
           the frequent use of euphemisms and double-entendre. The
           double meaning in a Hawaiian mele will not always be evident
           to one whose acquaintance with the language is not intimate.
           To one who comes to it from excursions in Anglo-Saxon poetry,
           wandering through its "meadows trim with daisies pied," the
           sly intent of the Hawaiian, even when pointed out, will, no
           doubt, seem an inconsequential thing and the demonstration of
           it an impertinence, if not a fiction to the imagination. Its
           euphemisms in reality have no baser intent than the euphuisms
           of Lyly, Ben Jonson, or Shakespeare.

                Love tousled Waimea with, shafts of the wind,
                While Kipuupuu puffed jealous gusts.
                Love is a tree that blights in the cold,
                But thrives in the woods of Mahiki.
            5   Smitten art thou with the blows of love;
                Luscious the water-drip in the wilds;
                Wearied and bruised is the flower of Koaie;
                Stung by the frost the herbage of Wai-ka-e:
                And this--it is love.
           10   Wai-ka, loves me like a sweetheart.
                Dear as my heart Koolau's yellow eye,
                My flower in the tangled wood, Hule-i-a,
                A travel-wreath to lay on love's breast,
                A shade to cover my journey's long climb.
           15   Love-touched, distraught, mine a wilderness-home;
                But still do I cherish the old spot,
                For love--it is love.
                Your love visits me even here:
                Where has it been hiding till now?

                Palepale i na auwai o lalo;
            5   Eli mawaho o ka hale o Koolau, e.
                E lau Koolau, he aina ko'e-ko'e;
                Maka'u i ke anu ka uka o ka Lahuloa.
