All jubilant with song,
And bright with many an Angel,
And all the Martyr throng;
The Prince is ever in them,
His light is always seen;
The pastures of the blessed
Are decked in glorious sheen.

3.
There is the throne of David,
And bliss without alloy;
The shout of them that triumph,
The song of festal joy;
And they, who with their Leader
Have conquered in the fight,
For ever and for ever
Are clad in robes of white.

4.
O sweet and blessed country,
The home of God's elect!
O sweet and blessed country
That eager hearts expect!
Jesu, in mercy bring us
To that dear land of rest;
Who art, with God the Father,
And Spirit, ever blest.

Jerusalem, my happy home

L. Anderson, S. J.
From an Italian Hymnal


Modrato (alla breve)

1.
Jerusalem, my happy home,
When shall I come to thee?
When shall my sorrows have and end?
Thy joys when shall I see?

2.
O happy harbor of the Saints,
O sweet and pleasant soil:
In thee no sorrow may be found.
No grief, no care, no toil.

3.
There lust and lucre cannot dwell,
There envy bears not sway,
There is no hunger, heat or cold
But pleasure ev'ry way.

4.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
God grant I once may see
Thy endless joys, and of the same,
Partaker, aye to be.

O Paradise! O Paradise!

Moderato

1.
O Paradise! O Paradise!
Who doth not crave for rest?
Who would not seek the happy land,
Where they that loved are blest:

Refrain
Where loyal hearts and true,
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture thro' and thro'
In God's most holy sight?

2.
O Paradise! O Paradise!
The world is growing old;
Who would not be at rest and free
Where love is never cold;

3.
O Paradise! O Paradise!
'Tis weary waiting here;
I long to be where Jesus is,
To feel, to see Him near;

4.
O Paradise! O Paradise!
I want to sin no more;
I want to be as pure on earth
As on thy spotless shore;

5.
O Paradise! O Paradise!
I greatly long to see
The special place my dearest Lord
In love prepares for me;

Faith of our Fathers: living still
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;
Oh, how our hearts beat high with joy
Whene'er we hear that glorious word.

Refrain
Faith of our Fathers! Holy Faith!
We will be true to thee till death.

2.
Our Fathers, chained in prisons dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free:
How sweet would be their children's fate,
If they, like them, could die for thee!

3.
Faith of our Fathers! We will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife:
And preach thee too, as love knows how
By kindly words and virtuous life:

Long Live the Pope

Hymn for the Pope
Rt. Rev. Msgr. Hugh T. Henry, Litt. D.
H. G. Ganss

Maestoso

1.
Long live the Pope! His praises sound again and yet again:
His rule is over space and time; His throne the hearts of men:
All hail! The Shepherd King of Rome, The theme of loving song:
Let all the earth his glory sing, And heav'n the strain prolong.
Let all the earth his glory sing, And heav'n the strain prolong.

2.
Beleaguered by the foes of earth, Beset by hosts of hell,
He guards the loyal flock of Christ, A watchful sentinel:
And yet, amid the din and strife, The clash of mace and sword,
He bears alone the shepherds staff, This champion of the Lord,
He bears alone the shepherds staff, This champion of the Lord.

3.
His signet is the Fisherman's; No sceptre does he bear;
In meek and lowly majesty He rules from Peter's Chair:
And yet from ev'ry tribe and tongue, From clime and zone,
Three hundred million voices sing, The glory of his throne,
Three hundred million voices sing, The glory of his throne,

4.
Then raise the chant, with heart and voice, In church and school and home:
"Long live the Shepherd of the Flock! Long live the Pope of Rome!"
Almighty Father, bless his work, Protect him in his ways,
Receive his pray'rs, fulfil his hopes and grant him "length of days,"
Receive his pray'rs, fulfil his hopes and grant him "length of days."

Blest is the Faith

Father Faber
Nicola A. Montani


Maestoso

1.
Blest is the Faith, divine and strong
Of thanks and praise and endless fountain,
Whose life is one perpetual song,
High up the Saviour's holy mountain.

Refrain
Oh, Sion's songs are sweet to sing,
With melodies of gladness laden;
Hark! how the harps of angels ring,
Hail! Son of Man! Hail Mother Maiden

2.
Blest is the Hope that holds to God,
In doubt and darkness still unshaken,
And sings along the heav'nly road,
Sweetest when most it seem forsaken.

3.
Blest is the Love that cannot love
Aught that earth gives of best and brightest;
Whose raptures thrill like saints' above,
Most when its earthly gifts are lightest.

1.
Hear Thy children, gentle Jesus,
While we breath our daily prayer,
Save us from all harm and danger,
Take us 'neath Thy shelt'ring care.
Save us from the wiles of Satan,
'Mid the lone and sleepful night,
Sweetly may bright Guardian Angels
Keep us 'neath their watchful sight.

2.
Gentle Jesus, look in pity,
From Thy great white throne above;
All the night Thy Heart is wakeful,
In Thy Sacrament of love.
Shades of even fast are falling,
Day is fading into gloom,
When the shades of death fall 'round us,
Lead Thine exiled children home.

Unison

1.
Little King, so fair and sweet,
See us gathered at Thy feet:
Be Thou Monarch of our school,
It shall prosper 'neath Thy rule.
We will be Thy subjects true,
Brave to suffer, brave to do;
All our hearts to Thee we bring,
Take them, keep them, little King.

2.
Raise Thy little hand to bless
All our childhood's happiness;
Bless our sorrow and our pain,
That each cross may be our gain.
Be Thine own sweet childhood, Lord,
Sanctify each though and word,
Set Thy seal on ev'ry thing
Which we do, O little King.

3.
Be our Teacher when we learn,
All the hard to easy turn;
Be our Playmate when we play,
So we shall indeed be gay.
Keep us happy, keep us pure,
While our childhood shall endure,
All its days to Thee we bring,
Bless them guard them, little King.

4.
And when holidays have come,
Call Thy children to Thy home,
In that gentle voice of Thine,
Which we know, sweet Child divine.
At the gate, oh, meet us thus,
As we loved Thee--Child like us;
Stretch Thine hands in welcoming
To Thine own, O little King.

Andante mosso

1.
When blossoms flowered 'mid the snows
Upon a winter night,
Was born the Child, the Christmas Rose,
The King of Love and Light.
The angels sang, the shepherds sang
The grateful earth rejoiced;
And at His blessed birth the stars
Their exultation voiced.

Refrain
O come let us adore Him,
O come let us adore Him,
O come let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.

2.
Again the heart with rapture glows
To greet the holy night,
That gave the world its Christmas Rose,
Its King of Love and Light.
Let ev'ry voice acclaim His name,
The grateful chorus swell.
From paradise to earth He came
That we with Him might dwell.

Andante

1.
Dear little One! How sweet Thou art,
Thine eyes, how bright they shine;
So bright, they almost seem to speak
When Mary's look meets Thine!

2.
How faint and feeble is Thy cry,
Like plaint of harmless dove,
When Thou dost murmur in Thy Sleep
Of sorrow and of love.

3.
When Mary bids Thee sleep
Thou sleep'st, Thou wakest when she calls;
Thou art content upon her lap,
Or in the rugged stalls.

4.
Saint Joseph takes Thee in his arms,
And smoothes Thy little cheek,
Thou lookest up in to his face
So helpless and so meek.

5.
Yes! Thou art what Thou seem'st to be,
A thing of smiles ands tears;
Yet Thou art God, and Heav'n and earth
Adore Thee with their fears.

HOLY COMMUNION
Acts of Faith, Hope and Contrition

Great God, whatever through Thy Church

From a Slovak Hymnal


Maestoso

1. Faith
Great God, whatever thro' Thy Church
Thou teachest to be true,
I firmly do believe it all,
And will confess it, too.
Thou never canst deceived be,
Thou never canst deceive,
For Thou art truth itself, and Thou
Dost tell me to believe.

2. Hope
My God, I firmly hope in Thee,
For Thou art great and good;
Thou gavest us Thine only Son
To die upon the Rood.
I hope thro' Him for grace to live
As Thy commandments teach,
And thro' Thy mercy, when I die
The joys of Heav'n to reach.

3. Love
With all my heart and soul and strength,
I love Thee, O my Lord,
For Thou art perfect, and all things
Were made by Thy blest Word.
Like me to Thine own image made,
My neighbor Thou didst make,
And as I love myself, I love
My neighbor for Thy sake.

4. Contrition
Most Holy God, my very soul
With grief sincere is mov'd,
Because I have offended Thee,
Whom I should e'er have lov'd.
Forgive me, Father; I am now
Resolved to sin no more,
And by Thy holy grace to shun
What made me sin before.

No more by sin to grieve Thee,
Or fly Thy sweet control.

Prepare me to receive Him
And trust the Word to me.
