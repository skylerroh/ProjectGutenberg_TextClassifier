must look now to their daughters to overcome our own allied armies of evil
and to save us from ourselves. She must and will succeed, for as David
sang--"God shall help her, and that right early." When we try to praise her
later works it is as if we would pour incense upon the rose. It is the
proudest boast of many of us that we are "bound to her by bonds dearer than
freedom," and that we live in the reflected royalty which shines from her
brow. We rejoice with her that at last we begin to know what John on Patmos
meant--"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven, a woman clothed with
the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve
stars." She brought to warring men the Prince of Peace, and he, departing,
left his scepter not in her hand, but in her soul. "The time of times" is
near when "the new woman" shall subdue the whole earth with the weapons of
peace. Then shall wrong be robbed of her bitterness and ingratitude of her
sting, revenge shall clasp hands with pity, and love shall dwell in the
tents of hate; while side by side, equal partners in all that is worth
living for, shall stand the new man with the new woman.

THE MOTHER CHURCH

The Mother Church edifice--The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in
Boston, is erected. The close of the year, Anno Domini 1894, witnessed the
completion of "our prayer in stone," all predictions and prognostications
to the contrary notwithstanding.

Of the significance of this achievement we shall not undertake to speak in
this article. It can be better felt than expressed. All who are awake
thereto have some measure of understanding of what it means. But only the
future will tell the story of its mighty meaning or unfold it to the
comprehension of mankind. It is enough for us now to know that all
obstacles to its completion have been met and overcome, and that our temple
is completed as God intended it should be.

This achievement is the result of long years of untiring, unselfish, and
zealous effort on the part of our beloved teacher and Leader, the Reverend
Mary Baker Eddy, the Discoverer and Founder of Christian Science, who
nearly thirty years ago began to lay the foundation of this temple, and
whose devotion and consecration to God and humanity during the intervening
years have made its erection possible.

Those who now, in part, understand her mission, turn their hearts in
gratitude to her for her great work, and those who do not understand it
will, in the fulness of time, see and acknowledge it. In the measure in
which she has unfolded and demonstrated divine Love, and built up in human
consciousness a better and higher conception of God as Life, Truth, and
Love,--as the divine Principle of all things which really exist,--and in
the degree in which she has demonstrated the system of healing of Jesus and
the apostles, surely she, as the one chosen of God to this end, is entitled
to the gratitude and love of all who desire a better and grander humanity,
and who believe it to be possible to establish the kingdom of heaven upon
earth in accordance with the prayer and teachings of Jesus Christ.

TESTIMONIAL AND GIFT

TO REV. MARY BAKER EDDY, FROM THE FIRST CHURCH OF CHRIST, SCIENTIST, IN
BOSTON

Rev. Mary Baker Eddy received Friday, from the Christian Science Board of
Directors, Boston, a beautiful and unique testimonial of the appreciation
of her labors and loving generosity in the Cause of their common faith. It
was a facsimile of the corner-stone of the new church of the Christian
Scientists, just completed, being of granite, about six inches in each
dimension, and contains a solid gold box, upon the cover of which is this
inscription:--

"To our Beloved Teacher, the Reverend Mary Baker Eddy, Discoverer and
Founder of Christian Science, from her affectionate Students, the Christian
Science Board of Directors."

On the under side of the cover are the facsimile signatures of the
Directors,--Ira O. Knapp, William B. Johnson, Joseph Armstrong, and Stephen
A. Chase, with the date, "1895." The beautiful souvenir is encased in an
elegant plush box.

Accompanying the stone testimonial was the following address from the Board
of Directors:--

    Boston, March 20, 1895.

    _To the Reverend Mary Baker Eddy, our Beloved Teacher and
    Leader_:--We are happy to announce to you the completion of The
    First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston.

    In behalf of your loving students and all contributors wherever
    they may be, we hereby present this church to you as a testimonial
    of love and gratitude for your labors and loving sacrifice, as the
    Discoverer and Founder of Christian Science, and the author of its
    textbook, "Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures."

    We therefore respectfully extend to you the invitation to become
    the permanent pastor of this church, in connection with the Bible
    and the book alluded to above, which you have already ordained as
    our pastor. And we most cordially invite you to be present and
    take charge of any services that may be held therein. We
    especially desire you to be present on the twenty-fourth day of
    March, eighteen hundred and ninety-five, to accept this offering,
    with our humble benediction.

    Lovingly yours,

    IRA O. KNAPP,
    JOSEPH ARMSTRONG,
    WILLIAM B. JOHNSON,
    STEPHEN A. CHASE,
    _The Christian Science Board of Directors_.


REV. MRS. EDDY'S REPLY

_Beloved Directors and Brethren_:--For your costly offering, and kind call
to the pastorate of "The First Church of Christ, Scientist," in
Boston--accept my profound thanks. But permit me, respectfully, to decline
their acceptance, while I fully appreciate your kind intentions. If it will
comfort you in the least, make me your _Pastor Emeritus_, nominally.
Through my book, your textbook, I already speak to you each Sunday. You ask
too much when asking me to accept your grand church edifice. I have more of
earth now, than I desire, and less of heaven; so pardon my refusal of that
as a material offering. More effectual than the forum are our states of
mind, to bless mankind. This wish stops not with my pen--God give you
grace. As our church's tall tower detains the sun, so may luminous lines
from your lives linger, a legacy to our race.

    MARY BAKER EDDY.

    March 25, 1895.
