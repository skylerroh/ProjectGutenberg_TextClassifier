
    Remember, too, the poor young slave,
      Who never felt your joy,
    Who, early old, has never known
      The bliss to be a boy.

    Ye Christians! ministers of Him
      Who came to make men free,
    When, at the Almighty Maker's throne,
      You bend the suppliant knee,

    From the deep fountains of your soul
      Then let your prayers ascend
    For the poor slave, who hardly knows
      That God is still his friend.

    Let all who know that God is just,
      That Jesus came to save,
    Unite in the most holy cause
      Of the forsaken slave.


HOME-SICKNESS.

TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN.

    Were I a wild, wild falcon,
      I'd soar away on high,
    And seek my father's dwelling,
      Beyond the far blue sky.

    Against that well-known door then
      I'd flap my wings with joy;
    My mother from the window
      Sees and admits her boy.

    "Dear son!" she'd say; "O, welcome!
      How often has my heart
    Longed sadly to embrace thee;
      Now here behold thou art!"

    Thus memory still is dreaming
      Of what can never be.
    My long-lost home,--the loved ones,--
      These eyes may never see.


HAPPINESS.

    What is it makes the morning bright?
      What gilds the evening hours?
    What makes our hearts seem gay and light,
      As if we trod on flowers?

    'Tis innocence that makes us gay,
      Bids flowers grow everywhere;
    Makes it bright sunshine every day.
      And every evening fair.

    What makes us, when we look above,
      See smiling angels there,
    And think they look on us in love,
      As if we were their care?
    'Tis that the soul, all free from sin,
      Glows like an inward sun;
    And heaven above and heaven within
     Do meet and join in one.


CHILDREN IN SLAVERY.

    When children play the livelong day,
      Like birds and butterflies,
    As free and gay sport life away,
      And know not care nor sighs;

    Then earth and air seem fresh and fair,
      All peace below, above;
    Life's flowers are there, and everywhere
      Is innocence and love.

    When children pray with fear all day,
      A blight must be at hand;
    Then joys decay, and birds of prey
      Are hovering o'er the land.
    When young hearts weep as they go to sleep,
      Then all the world seems sad;
    The flesh must creep, and woes are deep,
      When children are not glad.


TO GOOD RESOLUTIONS.

    How like the morning flower ye are!
      Which lifts its diamond head,
      Exulting in the mead;
    But the rude wind shall steal its gem,
      Shall break its tender stem,
        And leave it dead.

    Frail pledges of the contrite heart,
      Wherefore so soon decay?
      O, yet prolong your stay!
    Until my soul shall boldly rise,
      And claim its native skies,
        Haste not away.


THANKS FOR A PLEASANT DAY.

    Come, let us all, with heart and voice,
      To God our Father sing and pray;
    In his unceasing love rejoice,
      And thank him for this pleasant day.

    The clear blue sky looks full of love;
      Let all our selfish passions cease!
    O, let us lift our thoughts above,
      Where all is brightness, goodness, peace.

    If we have done a brother wrong,
      O, let us seek to be forgiven;
    Nor let one discord spoil the song
      Our hearts would raise this day to heaven.

    This blessed day, when the pure air
      Is full of sweetness, full of joy,--
    When all around is calm and fair,--
      Shall we the harmony destroy?

    O, may it be our earnest care
      To free our souls from every sin;
    Then will each day be bright and fair,
      For God's pure sunshine dwells within.


TO A BUTTERFLY.

     [Those who are acquainted with this little poem, translated
     from Herder, will perceive that a slight liberty has been
     taken with the last two lines.]

    Airy, lovely, heavenly thing!
    Butterfly with quivering wing!
    Hovering in thy transient hour
    Over every bush and flower,
    Feasting upon flowers and dew,
    Thyself a brilliant blossom, too!

    Who, with skilful fingers fine,
    Purpled o'er those wings of thine?
    Was it some sylph whose tender care
    Spangled thy robes so fine and fair,
    And wove them of the morning air?
    I feel thy little throbbing heart;
    Thou fear'st e'en now death's bitter smart.

    Fly, little spirit, fly away!
    Be free and joyful thy short day!
    Image thou dost seem to me
    Of that which I may one day be,
    When I shall drop this robe of earth,
    And wake into a spirit's birth.


TO NATURE.

FROM THE GERMAN OF FREDERICK LEOPOLD, COUNT OF STALBERG.

    Holy nature! fresh and free,
    Let me ever follow thee;
    By the hand, O, lead me still,
    Like a child, at thy sweet will.

    When with weariness oppressed,
    I will on thy bosom rest,
    Breathe in pleasure from above,
    In thy mother-arms of love.

    O, how well it is for me
    Thee to love, with thee to be!
    Holy nature! sweet and free,
    Let me ever follow thee.


ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG COMPANION.

        Farewell for a time!
        Thou hast gone to that clime
    Where sickness and sorrow are o'er.
        We loved thee when here,
        We shed the sad tear
    To think we shall see thee no more.

        We weep not for thee,
        We remember that He
    Who made little children his care
        In his own fatherland
        Will reach you his hand,
    And comfort and welcome you there.

        Our tears they will flow;
        But do we not know
    That thou art released from all pain?
        Then weep not; for He
        Who walked on the sea
    Has said we shall all live again.


THE SABBATH IS HERE.

FROM KRUMACHER.

    The Sabbath is here, it is sent us from heaven;
           Rest, rest, toilsome life,
           Be silent all strife,
           Let us stop on our way,
           And give thanks and pray
         To Him who all things has given.

    The Sabbath is here, to the fields let us go;
           How fresh and how fair!
           In the still morning air,
           The bright golden grain
           Waves over the plain;
         It is God who doth all this bestow.

    The Sabbath is here; on this blessed morn
           No tired ox moans,
           No creaking wheel groans,
           At rest is the plough;
           No noise is heard now,
         Save the sound of the rustling corn.

    The Sabbath is here; our seed we have sown
           In hope and in faith;
           The Father he saith
           Amen! Be it so!
           Behold the corn grow!
         Rejoicing his goodness we'll own.

    The Sabbath is here; His love we will sing
           Who sendeth the rain
           Upon the young grain.
           And soon all around
           The sickle will sound.
         And home the bright sheaves we will bring.

    The Sabbath is here; in hope and in love
           We sow in the dust,
           While humbly we trust
           Up yonder shall grow
           The seed which we sow,
         And bloom a bright garland above.


THE CHILD AT HER MOTHER'S GRAVE.

TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN.

    In that little room of thine,
      Sweet sleep has come to thee;
    Ah, mother! dearest mother mine!
    O, call me to that room of thine!
      O, shut it not from me!

    I would so gladly be with thee,
      And be thy child again;
    'Tis cold and stormy here with me,
    'Tis warm, and, O, so still with thee!
      Ah! let me, let me in!

    Thou took'st me gladly once with thee,
      So gladly held my hand;
    O, see, thou hast forsaken me!
    Take me this time again with thee
      Into the heavenly land.


CHILD'S SONG.

TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN.

    When at night I go to sleep,
      Fourteen angels are at hand;--
    Two on my right their watches keep;
      Two on my left to bless me stand;
    Two hover gently o'er my head;
    Two guard the foot of my small bed;
    Two wake me with the sun's first ray;
    Two dress me nicely every day;
    Two guide me on the heavenly road,
    That leads to paradise and God.


TO A FOUNTAIN.

FROM THE GERMAN OF RAMLER.

    Lo! this fount is flowing ever;
    But the fountain prattles never.
    Traveller! at this fountain stay;
    Learn of it, with pure endeavour,
    Good to do, and nothing say.


SONG FOR AN INFANT SCHOOL.

        Children go
        To and fro,
    In a merry, pretty row,
        Footsteps light,
        Faces bright;
      'Tis a happy sight.
    Swiftly turning round and round,
    Do not look upon the ground.
        Follow me,
        Full of glee,
      Singing merrily.

        Birds are free,
        So are we;
    And we live as happily.
        Work we do,
        Study too,
      For we learn "twice two";
    Then we laugh, and dance, and sing,
    Gay as birds or any thing.
        Follow me,
        Full of glee,
      Singing merrily.

        Work is done,
        Play's begun;
    Now we have our laugh and fun.
        Happy days,
        Pretty plays,
      And no naughty ways.
    Holding fast each other's hand,
    We're a little happy band;
        Follow me,
        Full of glee,
      Singing merrily.


THE SUMMER.

A FREE TRANSLATION OF A GERMAN POPULAR SONG.

    Go forth, my heart, and seek the bliss
    Of such a summer day as this,
      Bestowed on all by Heaven;
    The beauties of the garden see,
    Behold! it is for thee and me
      Its glories all are given.

    The trees with whispering leaves are dressed,
    The earth upon her dusky breast
      Her robe of green is wearing;
    The flowers are blooming far and wide,--
