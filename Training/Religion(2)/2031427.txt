Christian Science. To impersonalize scientifically the
material sense of existence--rather than cling to per-
sonality--is the lesson of to-day.




A Card


My answer to manifold letters relative to the return
of members that have gone out of The First Church of
Christ, Scientist, in Boston, is this: While my affec-
tions plead for all and every one, and my desire is that
all shall be redeemed, I am not unmindful that the Scrip- [15]
tures enjoin, "Let all things be done decently and in
order."

To continue one's connection with this church, or to
regain it, one must comply with the church rules. All
who desire its fellowship, and to become members of it, [20]
must send in their petitions to this effect to the Clerk
of the church; and upon a meeting being called, the
First Members will determine the action of the church
on this subject.




Overflowing Thoughts


In this receding year of religious jubilee, 1894, I as [26]
an individual would cordially invite all persons who
have left our fold, together with those who never have

[Page 311.]

been in it,--all who love God and keep His command- [1]
ments,--to come and unite with The Mother Church in
Boston. The true Christian Scientists will be welcomed,
greeted as brethren endeavoring to walk with us hand
in hand, as we journey to the celestial city. [5]

Also, I would extend a tender invitation to Christian
Scientists' students, those who are ready for the table of
our Lord: so, should we follow Christ's teachings; so,
bury the dead past; so, loving one another, go forth to
the full vintage-time, exemplifying what we profess. But [10]
some of the older members are not quite ready to take
this advanced step in the full spirit of that charity which
thinketh no evil; and if it be not taken thus, it is impracti-
cal, unfruitful, Soul-less.

My deepest desires and daily labors go to prove that [15]
I love my enemies and would help all to gain the abiding
consciousness of health, happiness, and heaven.

I hate no one; and love others more than they can
love me. As I now understand Christian Science, I would
as soon harm myself as another; since by breaking [20]
Christ's command, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself," I should lose my hope of heaven.

The works I have written on Christian Science con-
tain absolute Truth, and my necessity was to tell it;
therefore I did this even as a surgeon who wounds [25]
to heal. I was a scribe under orders; and who can
refrain from transcribing what God indites, and ought
not that one to take the cup, drink all of it, and give
thanks?

Being often reported as saying what never escaped [30]
from my lips, when rehearsing facts concerning others
who were reporting false charges, I have been sorry that

[Page 312.]

I spoke at all, and wished I were wise enough to guard [1]
against that temptation. Oh, may the love that is talked,
be _felt_! and so _lived_, that when weighed in the scale of
God we be not found wanting. Love is consistent, uni-
form, sympathetic, self-sacrificing, unutterably kind; even [5]
that which lays all upon the altar, and, speechless and
alone, bears all burdens, suffers all inflictions, endures
all piercing for the sake of others, and for the kingdom
of heaven's sake.




A Great Man And His Saying


Hon. Charles Carrol Bonney, President of the World's [11]
Congress Auxiliary, in his remarks before that body,
said, "No more striking manifestation of the interposi-
tion of divine Providence in human affairs has come in
recent years, than that shown in the raising up of the [15]
body of people known as Christian Scientists, who are
called to declare the real harmony between religion and
Science, and to restore the waning faith of many in the
verities of the sacred Scriptures."

In honest utterance of veritable history, and his own [20]
spiritual discernment, this man must have risen above
worldly schemes, human theorems or hypotheses, to
conclusions which reason too supine or misemployed
cannot fasten upon. He spake inspired; he touched a
tone of Truth that will continue to reverberate and renew [25]
its emphasis throughout the entire centuries, into the vast
forever.

[Page 313.]




Words Of Commendation


_Editor of The Christian Science Journal_:--Permit me
to say that your editorial in the August number is _par_
_excellence_.

It is a digest of good manners, morals, methods, and [5]
means. It points to the scientific spiritual molecule,
pearl, and pinnacle, that everybody needs. May the
Christlikeness it reflects rest on the dear readers, and
throw the light of penetration on the page; even as the
dawn, kindling its glories in the east, lightens earth's [10]
landscape.

I thank the contributors to _The Christian Science_
_Journal_ for their jewels of thought, so adapted to the
hour, and without ill-humor or hyperbolic tumor. I
was impressed by the articles entitled "The New Pas- [15]
tor," by Rev. Lanson P. Norcross, "The Lamp," by
Walter Church, "The Temptation," a poem by J. J.
Rome, etc.

The field waves its white ensign, the reapers are strong,
the rich sheaves are ripe, the storehouse is ready: pray [20]
ye therefore the God of harvest to send forth more
laborers of the excellent sort, and garner the supplies
for a world.




Church And School


Humbly, and, as I believe, divinely directed, I hereby [25]
ordain the Bible, and "Science and Health with Key
to the Scriptures," to be hereafter the only pastor of

[Page 314.]

The Church of Christ, Scientist, throughout our land [1]
and in other lands.

From this date the Sunday services of our denomina-
tion shall be conducted by Readers in lieu of pastors.
Each church, or society formed for Sunday worship, [5]
shall elect two Readers: a male, and a female. One of
these individuals shall open the meeting by reading the
hymns, and chapter (or portion of the chapter) in the
Bible, lead in silent prayer, and repeat in concert with
the congregation the Lord's Prayer. Also, this First [10]
Reader shall give out any notices from the pulpit, shall
read the Scriptures indicated in the Sunday School Les-
son of the _Christian Science Quarterly_, and shall pro-
nounce the benediction.

The First Reader shall read from my book, "Science [15]
and Health with Key to the Scriptures," alternately in
response to the congregation, the spiritual interpreta-
tion of the Lord's Prayer; also, shall read all the selec-
tions from Science and Health referred to in the Sunday
Lessons. [20]

The Reader of the Scriptures shall name, at each
reading, the book, chapter, and verses. The Reader of
"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures" shall
commence by announcing the full title of this book, with
the name of its author, and add to this announcement, [25]
"the Christian Science textbook." It is unnecessary to
repeat the title or page. This form shall also be observed
at the Communion service; the selections from both the
Bible and the Christian Science textbook shall be taken
from the _Quarterly_, as heretofore, and this Lesson shall [30]
be such as is adapted to that service. On the first Sunday
of each month, except Communion Sunday, a sermon

[Page 315.]

shall be preached to the children, from selections taken [1]
from the Scriptures and Science and Health, especially
adapted to the occasion, and read after the manner of
the Sunday service. The children's service shall be
held on the Sunday following Communion Day. [5]

No copies from my books are allowed to be written,
and read from manuscripts, either in private or in pub-
lic assemblies, except by their author.

Christian Scientists, all over the world, who are let-
terly fit and specially spiritually fitted for teachers, can [10]
teach annually three classes only. They shall teach
from the Christian Science textbook. Each class shall
consist of not over thirty-three students, carefully selected,
and only of such as have promising proclivities toward
Christian Science. The teacher shall hold himself mor- [15]
ally obligated to look after the welfare of his students,
not only through class term, but after it; and to watch
well that they prove sound in sentiment, health, and
practical Christian Science.

Teaching Christian Science shall be no question of [20]
money, but of morals and of uplifting the race. Teachers
shall form associations for this purpose; and for the
first few years, convene as often as once in three months.
Teachers shall not silently mentally address the thought,
to handle it, nor allow their students to do thus, except [25]
the individual needing it asks for mental treatment.
They shall steadily and patiently strive to educate their
students in conformity to the unerring wisdom and law
of God, and shall enjoin upon them habitually to study
His revealed Word, the Scriptures, and "Science and [30]
Health with Key to the Scriptures."

They shall teach their students how to defend them-

[Page 316.]

selves against mental malpractice, but never to return [1]
evil for evil; never to attack the malpractitioner, but
to know the truth that makes free,--and so to be a law
not unto others, but themselves.




Class, Pulpit, Students' Students


When will you take a class in Christian Science or [6]
speak to your church in Boston? is often asked.

I shall speak to my dear church at Boston very seldom.
The Mother Church must be self-sustained by God.
The date of a class in Christian Science should depend [10]
on the fitness of things, the tide which flows heavenward,
the hour best for the student. Until minds become less
worldly-minded, and depart farther from the primitives
of the race, and have profited up to their present capac-
ity from the written word, they are not ready for the [15]
word spoken at this date.

My juniors can tell others what they know, and turn
them slowly toward the haven. Imperative, accumula-
tive, sweet demands rest on my retirement from life's
bustle. What, then, of continual recapitulation of tired [20]
aphorisms and disappointed ethics; of patching breaches
widened the next hour; of pounding wisdom and love
into sounding brass; of warming marble and quench-
ing volcanoes! Before entering the Massachusetts Meta-
physical College, had my students achieved the point [25]
whence they could have derived most benefit from their
pupilage, to-day there would be on earth paragons of
Christianity, patterns of humility, wisdom, and might
for the world.

[Page 317.]

To the students whom I have not seen that ask, "May [1]
I call you mother?" my heart replies, _Yes_, if you are
doing God's work. When born of Truth and Love, we
are all of one kindred.

The hour has struck for Christian Scientists to do their [5]
own work; to appreciate the signs of the times; to dem-
onstrate self-knowledge and self-government; and to
demonstrate, as this period demands, over all sin, disease,
and death. The dear ones whom I would have great
pleasure in instructing, know that the door to my teaching [10]
was shut when my College closed.

Again, it is not absolutely requisite for some people
to be taught in a class, for they can learn by spiritual
growth and by the study of what is written. Scarcely a
moiety, compared with the whole of the Scriptures and [15]
the Christian Science textbook, is yet assimilated spirit-
ually by the most faithful seekers; yet this assimilation is
indispensable to the progress of every Christian Scientist.
These considerations prompt my answers to the above
questions. Human desire is inadequate to adjust the [20]
balance on subjects of such earnest import. These
words of our Master explain this hour: "What I do
thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter."

My sympathies are deeply enlisted for the students
of students; having already seen in many instances their [25]
talents, culture, and singleness of purpose to uplift the
race. Such students should not pay the penalty for
other people's faults; and divine Love will open the
way for them. My soul abhors injustice, and loves
mercy. St. John writes: "Whom God hath sent speaketh [30]
the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by meas-
ure unto him."

[Page 318.]




My Students And Thy Students


Mine and thine are obsolete terms in absolute Christian [2]
Science, wherein and whereby the universal brotherhood
of man is stated and demands to be demonstrated. I have
a large affection, not alone for my students, but for thy [5]
students,--for students of the second generation. I can-
not but love some of those devoted students better than
some of mine who are less lovable or Christly. This
natural affection for goodness must go on _ad libitum_ unto
the third and fourth and final generation of those who [10]
love God and keep His commandments. Hence the
following is an amendment of the paragraph on page 47(6)
of "Retrospection and Introspection":--

Any student, having received instructions in a Primary
class from me, or from a loyal student of Christian Science, [15]
and afterwards studied thoroughly "Science and Health
with Key to the Scriptures," can enter upon the gospel
work of teaching Christian Science, and so fulfil the command
of Christ. Before entering this sacred field of labor,
the student must have studied faithfully the latest edi- [20]
tions of my works, and be a good Bible scholar and a
devout, consecrated Christian.

These are the indispensable demands on all those who
become teachers.




Unseen Sin


Two points of danger beset mankind; namely, making [26]
sin seem either too large or too little: if too large, we

[Page 319.]

are in the darkness of all the ages, wherein the true sense [1]
of the unity of good and the unreality of evil is lost.

If good is God, even as God is good, then good and
evil can neither be coeval nor coequal, for God is All-in-
all. This closes the argument of aught besides Him, aught [5]
else than good.

If the sense of sin is too little, mortals are in danger
of not seeing their own belief in sin, but of seeing too
keenly their neighbor's. Then they are beset with
egotism and hypocrisy. Here Christian Scientists must [10]
be most watchful. Their habit of mental and audible
protest against the reality of sin, tends to make sin less
or more to them than to other people. They must either
be overcoming sin in themselves, or they must not lose
sight of sin; else they are self-deceived sinners of the [15]
worst sort.




A Word To The Wise


Will all the dear Christian Scientists accept my tender
greetings for the forthcoming holidays, and grant me
this request,--let the present season pass without one [20]
gift to me.

Our church edifice must be built in 1894. Take thither
thy saintly offerings, and lay them in the outstretched
hand of God. The object to be won affords ample oppor-
tunity for the grandest achievement to which Christian [25]
Scientists can direct attention, and feel themselves alone
among the stars.

No doubt must intervene between the promise and
event; faith and resolve are friends to Truth; seize them,

[Page 320.]

trust the divine Providence, push upward our prayer in [1]
stone,--and God will give the benediction.




Christmas


This interesting day, crowned with the history of
Truth's idea,--its earthly advent and nativity,--is [5]
especially dear to the heart of Christian Scientists; to
whom Christ's appearing in a fuller sense is so precious,
and fraught with divine benedictions for mankind.

The star that looked lovingly down on the manger of
our Lord, lends its resplendent light to this hour: the [10]
light of Truth, to cheer, guide, and bless man as he
reaches forth for the infant idea of divine perfection
dawning upon human imperfection,--that calms man's
fears, bears his burdens, beckons him on to Truth and
Love and the sweet immunity these bring from sin, sick- [15]
ness, and death.

This polar star, fixed in the heavens of divine Science,
shall be the sign of his appearing who "healeth all our
diseases;" it hath traversed night, wading through
darkness and gloom, on to glory. It doth meet the [20]
antagonism of error; addressing to dull ears and undis-
ciplined beliefs words of Truth and Life.

The star of Bethlehem is the star of Boston, high in
the zenith of Truth's domain, that looketh down on the
long night of human beliefs, to pierce the darkness and [25]
melt into dawn.

The star of Bethlehem is the light of all ages; is the
light of Love, to-day christening religion undefiled, divine
Science; giving to it a new name, and the white stone in
token of purity and permanence. [30]

[Page 321.]

The wise men follow this guiding star; the watchful [1]
shepherd chants his welcome over the cradle of a great
truth, and saith, "Unto us a child is born," whose birth
is less of a miracle than eighteen centuries ago; and "his
name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty [5]
God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."

My heart is filled with joy, that each receding year sees
the steady gain of Truth's idea in Christian Science; that
each recurring year witnesses the balance adjusted more
on the side of God, the supremacy of Spirit; as shown [10]
by the triumphs of Truth over error, of health over sick-
ness, of Life over death, and of Soul over sense.

"The hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor-
shippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth."
"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made [15]
me free from the law of sin and death." "Fear not, little
flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you
the kingdom."


    Press on, press on! ye sons of light,
    Untiring in your holy fight, [20]
    Still treading each temptation down,
    And battling for a brighter crown.




Card


In reply to all invitations from Chicago to share the
hospitality of their beautiful homes at any time during [25]
the great wonder of the world, the World's Fair, I say,
Do not expect me. I have no desire to see or to hear
what is to be offered upon this approaching occasion.

I have a world of wisdom and Love to contemplate,
that concerns me, and you, infinitely beyond all earthly [30]

[Page 322.]

expositions or exhibitions. In return for your kindness, [1]
I earnestly invite you to its contemplation with me, and
to preparation to behold it.




Message To The Mother Church


_Beloved Brethren_:--People coming from a distance [5]
expecting to hear me speak in The Mother Church,
are frequently disappointed. To avoid this, I may here-
after notify the Directors when I shall be present to
address this congregation, and the Clerk of the church
can inform correspondents. Your dual and impersonal [10]
pastor, the Bible, and "Science and Health with Key to
the Scriptures," is with you; and the Life these give, the
Truth they illustrate, the Love they demonstrate, is
the great Shepherd that feedeth my flock, and leadeth
them "beside the still waters." By any personal pres- [15]
ence, or word of mine, your thought must not be diverted
or diverged, your senses satisfied, or self be justified.

Therefore, beloved, my often-coming is unnecessary;
for, though I be present or absent, it is God that feed-
eth the hungry heart, that giveth grace for grace, that [20]
healeth the sick and cleanseth the sinner. For this
consummation He hath given you Christian Science,
and my past poor labors and love. He hath shown you
the amplitude of His mercy, the justice of His judgment,
the omnipotence of His love; and this, to compensate [25]
your zealous affection for seeking good, and for labor-
ing in its widening grooves from the infinitesimal to the
infinite.





CHAPTER IX. THE FRUIT OF SPIRIT


[Page 323.]




An Allegory


Picture to yourself "a city set upon a hill," a [2]
celestial city above all clouds, in serene azure and
unfathomable glory: having no temple therein, for God is
the temple thereof; nor need of the sun, neither of the [5]
moon, for God doth lighten it. Then from this sacred
summit behold a Stranger wending his way downward,
to where a few laborers in a valley at the foot of the moun-
tain are working and watching for his coming.

The descent and ascent are beset with peril, priva- [10]
tion, temptation, toil, suffering. Venomous serpents hide
among the rocks, beasts of prey prowl in the path, wolves
in sheep's clothing are ready to devour; but the Stranger
meets and masters their secret and open attacks with
serene confidence. [15]

The Stranger eventually stands in the valley at the
foot of the mountain. He saith unto the patient toilers
therein: "What do ye here? Would ye ascend the moun-
tain,--climbing its rough cliffs, hushing the hissing
serpents, taming the beasts of prey,--and bathe in its [20]
streams, rest in its cool grottos, and drink from its living
fountains? The way winds and widens in the valley;
up the hill it is straight and narrow, and few there be that
find it."

[Page 324.]

His converse with the watchers and workers in the [1]
valley closes, and he makes his way into the streets of a
city made with hands.

Pausing at the threshold of a palatial dwelling, he
knocks and waits. The door is shut. He hears the [5]
sounds of festivity and mirth; youth, manhood, and age
gayly tread the gorgeously tapestried parlors, dancing-
halls, and banquet-rooms. But a little while, and the
music is dull, the wine is unsipped, the footfalls abate,
the laughter ceases. Then from the window of this dwel- [10]
ling a face looks out, anxiously surveying him who waiteth
at the door.

Within this mortal mansion are adulterers, fornicators,
idolaters; drunkenness, witchcraft, variance, envy, emu-
lation, hatred, wrath, murder. Appetites and passions [15]
have so dimmed their sight that he alone who looks from
that dwelling, through the clearer pane of his own heart
tired of sin, can see the Stranger.

Startled beyond measure at beholding him, this mortal
inmate withdraws; but growing more and more troubled, [20]
he seeks to leave the odious company and the cruel walls,
and to find the Stranger. Stealing cautiously away from
his comrades, he departs; then turns back,--he is afraid
to go on and to meet the Stranger. So he returns to the
house, only to find the lights all wasted and the music [25]
fled. Finding no happiness within, he rushes again
into the lonely streets, seeking peace but finding none.
Naked, hungry, athirst, this time he struggles on, and
at length reaches the pleasant path of the valley at the
foot of the mountain, whence he may hopefully look for [30]
the reappearance of the Stranger, and receive his heavenly
guidance.

[Page 325.]

The Stranger enters a massive carved stone mansion, [1]
and saith unto the dwellers therein, "Blessed are the
poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." But
they understand not his saying.

These are believers of different sects, and of no sect; [5]
some, so-called Christian Scientists in sheep's clothing;
and all "drunken without wine." They have small con-
ceptions of spiritual riches, few cravings for the immortal,
but are puffed up with the applause of the world: they
have plenty of pelf, and fear not to fall upon the Stranger, [10]
seize his pearls, throw them away, and afterwards try to
kill him.
