2   The laws of Christian light,
    These are our weapons bright,
        Our mighty shield;
    Christ is our leader high,
    And the broad plains which lie
    Beneath the blessed sky,
        Our battle field.

3   On, then, in God's great name,
    Let each pure spirit's flame
        Burn bright and clear:
    Stand firmly in your lot,
    Cry ye aloud, "Doubt not,"
    Be every fear forgot,
        Christ leads us here.

4   So shall Earth's distant lands
    In happy, holy bands,
        One brotherhood,
    Together rise and sing,
    And joyful offerings bring,
    And Heaven's Eternal King
        Pronounce it _good_.

Prayer for Universal Peace.


1   Lord, send thy word, and let it run,
      Armed with thy Spirit's power;
    Ten thousand shall confess its sway,
      And bless the saving hour.

2   Beneath the influence of thy grace
      The barren wastes shall rise,
    With sudden greens and fruits arrayed,
      A blooming paradise.

3   True holiness shall strike its root
      In each regenerate heart,
    Shall in a growth divine arise,
      And heavenly fruits impart.

4   Peace, with her olives crowned, shall stretch
      Her wings from shore to shore;
    No trump shall rouse the rage of war,
      Nor murderous cannon roar.

5   Lord, for those days we wait;--those days
      Are in thy word foretold;
    Fly swifter, sun and stars, and bring
      This promised age of gold!

The Gospel of Peace.


1   Joy to the earth! the Prince of Peace
      His banner has unfurled;
    Let strife, and sin, and error cease,
      And joy pervade the world!

2   Praise ye the Lord! for truth and grace
      His word and life display;
    Let every soul his love embrace,
      And own its gentle sway.

3   Peace on the earth, good will to men,
      Embraced the Gospel plan;
    Let that sweet strain be heard again,
      Which angel-tones began.

4   Joy to the isles and lands afar,
      Messiah reigns above;
    Let every eye behold the star,
      The star of light and love.

Peace.


1   No warlike sounds awoke the night,
      Announcing Jesus' birth,
    But angels borne on wings of light,
      Who chanted "Peace to earth!"

2   Not in the warrior's armor mailed
      Was Christ the Saviour found;
    Not striving, when by wrath assailed
      Not with the laurel crowned.

3   But meek and lowly was his life,
      The gentle Prince of Peace,
    Whose law condemns the hostile strife,
      And bids dissensions cease.

4   Then let the war-cry ne'er be rung
      Beneath the smiling sky,
    Nor to the clouds the banner flung
      That tells of victory.

5   But let the blissful period haste,
      When, hushed the cannon's roar,
    The sword shall cease mankind to waste,
      And war shall be no more.

1   O'er mountain tops, the mount of God,
      In latter days, shall rise
    Above the summits of the hills,
      And draw the wondering eyes.

2   The beams that shine from Zion's hill
      Shall lighten every land;
    The King who reigns in Salem's towers
      Shall the whole world command.

3   Nor war shall rage, nor hostile strife
      Disturb those happy years;
    To ploughshares men shall beat their swords,
      To pruning-hooks their spears.

4   No longer host, encountering host,
      Shall crowds of slain deplore;
    They'll lay the martial trumpet by,
      And study war no more.

The Blessings of Peace.


1   Peace! the welcome sound proclaim,
    Dwell with rapture on the theme;
    Loud, still louder, swell the strain:
    Peace on earth, good will to men.

2   Breezes! whispering soft and low,
    Gently murmur as ye blow,
    Breathe the sweet celestial strain,
    Peace on earth, good will to men.

3   Ocean's billows! far and wide
    Rolling in majestic pride:
    Loud still louder, swell the strain,
    Peace on earth, good will to men.

4   Christians! who these blessings feel,
    And in adoration kneel;
    Loud, still louder, swell the strain,
    Praise to God, good will to men.

Compassion for the Sinning.


1   Think gently of the erring!
      Lord, let us not forget,
    However darkly stained by sin,
      He is our brother yet.
    Heir of the same inheritance!
      Child of the self-same God!
    He hath but stumbled in the path,
      We have in weakness trod.

2   Speak gently to him, brother;
      Thou yet mayst lead him back,
    With holy words, and tones of love,
      From misery's thorny track.
    Forget not thou hast often sinned,
      And sinful yet must be:
    Deal gently with the erring one,
      As God hath dealt with thee.

The Same.


1   Breathe thoughts of pity o'er a brother's fall,
      But dwell not with stern anger on his fault;
    The grace of God alone holds thee, holds all;
      Were that withdrawn, thou, too, wouldst swerve and halt.

2   Send back the wand'rer to the Saviour's fold;
      That were an action worthy of a saint;
    But not in malice let the crime be told,
      Nor publish to the world the evil taint.

3   The Saviour suffers when his children slide;
      Then is his holy name by men blasphemed
    And he afresh is mocked and crucified,
      Even by those his bitter death redeemed.

4   Rebuke the sin, and yet in love rebuke;
      Feel as one member in another's pain;
    Win back the soul that his fair path forsook,
      And mighty and rejoicing is thy gain!

Reclaiming Power of Love.


1   Jesus, what precept is like thine,
      "Forgive, as ye would be forgiven!"
    If heeded, O what power divine
      Would then transform our earth to heaven.

2   Not by the harsh or scornful word,
      Should we our brother seek to gain,
    Not by the prison or the sword,
      The shackle, or the clanking chain.

3   But from our spirits there must flow
      A love that will his wrong outweigh;
    Our lips must only blessings know,
      And wrath and sin shall die away.

4   'Twas heaven that formed the holy plan
      To bring the wanderer back by love;
    Thus let us win our brother, man,
      And imitate thee, God above!

For the Prisoner.


1   Father! we pray for those who dwell
    Within the prison's gloomy cell!
    For those whose souls are bending low
    Beneath the weight of guilt and woe.

2   Thy love hath kept our thorny way
    And saved us from sin's iron sway;
    Our brethren in a weaker hour
    Have yielded to temptation's power.

3   Teach us with humble hearts to feel,
    How darkly on our brows the seal
    Of guilt might now perchance be set,
    Had we the same temptation met.

4   Then while the error we would shun,
    We still would aid the erring one
    To turn from sin's unpitying sway,
    To virtue's fair and pleasant way.

      From souls now clouded o'er by sin;
    Touch their deep springs, and let the day
      Of Christian love flow freely in.

2   Send them kind missions, though their feet
      No more again the world may tread;
    Some pulse of better life may beat
      In hearts that seem unmoved and dead.

3   'Tis just that they should bear the pain
      Of keen remorse and guilty shame;
    But scorn may drive to crime again--
      'Tis only love that can reclaim.

      To feel their fearful sin,
    And give to us a patient faith
      Those erring ones to win.

3     Give us to love thy law,
      The paths of vice to shun,
    But never harshly dare to spurn

    The patriot mourns, the tyrant boasts,
      And tears are shed like rain.

3     Lord Jesus, come; for chains
      Are still upon the slave;
    Bind up his wounds, relieve his pains,
      The pining bondman save.

4     Hark! herald voices near,
      Lead on thy happier day:
    Come, Lord, and our hosannas hear;
      We wait to strew thy way.

      With words of grace and power;
    Gather us all within thy fold,
      And let us stray no more.

2   The vile oppressor who hath made
      The widowed mother mourn,
    Though worthless, soulless he may stand,
      I cannot, dare not scorn.

3   The darkest night that shrouds the sky,
      Of beauty hath a share:
    The blackest heart hath sighs to tell
      That God still lingers there.

    Awakening in the human heart,
      Love for the true and right,
    Zeal for the Christian's better part,
      Strength for the Christian's fight.

2   Though heralded by nought of fear,
      Or outward sign or show;
    Though only to the inward ear
      It whisper soft and low;
    Though dropping as the manna fell,
      Unseen, yet from above,
    Holy and gentle, heed it well:

1   Scorn not the slightest word or deed,
      Nor deem it void of power;
    There's fruit in each wind-wafted seed,
      Waiting its natal hour.

2   A whispered word may touch the heart,
      And call it back to life;
    A look of love bid sin depart,
      And still unholy strife.

3   No act falls fruitless; none can tell
      How vast its power may be;
    Nor what results enfolded dwell
      Within it silently.

4   Work and despair not: bring thy mite,
      Nor care how small it be;
    God is with all that serve the right,
      The holy, true, and free.

2     I hear the thirsty cry!
      The hungry beg for bread!
    Then let my spring its stream supply,
      My hand its bounty shed.

3     The debtor humbly sues,
      Who would, but cannot pay;
    And shall I lenity refuse,
      Who need it every day?

4     And shall not wrath relent,
      Touched by that humble strain,
    My brother crying, "I repent,
      Nor will offend again?"

5     How else, on soaring wing,
      Can hope bear high my prayer,
    Up to thy throne, my God, my King,
      To plead for pardon there?

      Spread o'er all the glassy deep,
    All the azure lake serene
      Like another heaven was seen!

2   Lord! thy gracious word repeat
      To the billows of the proud!
    Quell the tyrant's martial heat,
      Quell the fierce and changing crowd!

    With hardy mariners survey
    The unknown regions of the sea.

2   They leave their native shores behind,
    And seize the favor of the wind;
    Till God command, and tempests rise,
    That heave the ocean to the skies.

3   When land is far, and death is nigh,
    Bereaved of hope, to God they cry:
    His mercy hears their loud address,
    And sends salvation in distress.

4   He bids the winds their wrath assuage,
    And stormy tempests cease to rage;
    The grateful band their fears give o'er
    And hail with joy their native shore.

    If but thy whisper order peace,
    How soon their rude commotions cease!

2   Lord of the sea!--the seaman keep
    From all dangers of the deep!
    When high the white-capped billows rise,
    When tempests roar along the skies,
    When foes or shoals awaken fear,--
    O, in thy mercy be thou near.

3   Lord of the sea!--a sea is life
    Of care and sorrow, woe and strife!
    With watchful pains we steer along,
    To keep the right path, shun the wrong:
    God grant, that, when we cease to roam,
    We gain an everlasting home!

    Silent on the mighty deep,
    While the boisterous surges hoarse
    Bear us daily on our course,
    Eye that never slumbers! shed
    Holy influence on our head.

3   When the Sabbath's peaceful ray,
    O'er the ocean's breast doth play,
    Though no throngs assemble there,
    No sweet church-bell warns to prayer,

    Sabbath to the unresting sea.

    Far from kindred, far from home,
    Stranger-eyes our conduct view,
    Heathen-bands our steps pursue,
    Let our conversation be
    Fitting those who follow thee.

5   Should pale death, with arrow dread,
    Make the ocean-cave our bed,

    Where that shrouded grave shall be--

    Deign to save the sailor's soul.

1   Our little bark, on boisterous seas,
      By cruel tempests tossed,
    Without one cheerful beam of hope,
      Expecting to be lost,--

      Breathed out our sad distress;
    Though feeble, yet with contrite hearts,
      We begged return of peace.

Prayer at Sea.


1   Prayer may be sweet in cottage homes,
      Where sire and child devoutly kneel,
    While through the open casement nigh
      The vernal blossoms fragrant steal.

2   Prayer may be sweet in stately halls,
      Where heart with kindred heart is blent,
    And upward to th' eternal throne
      The hymn of praise melodious sent.

3   But he who fain would know how warm
      The soul's appeal to God may be,
    From friends and native land should turn,
      A wanderer on the faithless sea;--

4   Should hear its deep, imploring tone
      Rise heavenward o'er the foaming surge,
    When billows toss the fragile bark,
      And fearful blasts the conflict urge.

5   Naught, naught appears but sea and sky;
      No refuge where the foot may flee:
    How will he cast, O Rock divine,
      The anchor of his soul on thee!

The Sailor's Grave.


1   Not in the church-yard shall he sleep,
      Amid the silent gloom,--
    His home was on the mighty deep,
      And there shall be his tomb.

2   He loved his own bright, deep blue sea,
      O'er it he loved to roam;
    And now his winding sheet shall be
      That same bright ocean's foam.

3   No village bell shall toll for him
      Its mournful, solemn dirge;
    The winds shall chant a requiem
      To him beneath the surge.

4   For him, break not the grassy turf,
      Nor turn the dewy sod;
    His dust shall rest beneath the surf,
      His spirit with its God.

Prayer for Seamen.


1   We come, O Lord, before thy throne,
      And, with united pleas,
    We meet and pray for those who roam
      Far off upon the seas.

2   O, may the Holy Spirit bow
      The sailor's heart to thee,
    Till tears of deep repentance flow
      Like rain-drops in the sea.

3   Then may a Saviour's dying love
      Pour peace into his breast,
    And waft him to the port above
      Of everlasting rest.

National Hymn.


1   My country 'tis of thee,
    Sweet land of liberty,
      Of thee I sing;
    Land where my fathers died,
    Land of the pilgrim's pride,
    From every mountain side
      Let freedom ring.

2   My native country, thee--
    Land of the noble, free--
      Thy name--I love;
    I love thy rocks and rills,
    Thy woods and templed hills;
    My heart with rapture thrills
      Like that above.

3   Let music swell the breeze,
    And ring from all the trees
      Sweet freedom's song:
    Let mortal tongues awake;
    Let all that breathe, partake;
    Let rocks their silence break,--
      The sound prolong.

4   Our fathers' God, to thee,
    Author of liberty,
      To thee we sing:
    Long may our land be bright
    With freedom's holy light;
    Protect us by thy might,
      Great God, our King.

Prayer for our Country.


1   Lord, while for all mankind we pray,
      Of every clime and coast,
    O, hear us for our native land,--
      The land we love the most.

2   O guard our shores from every foe,
      With peace our borders bless,
    With prosperous times our cities crown,
      Our fields with plenteousness.

3   Unite us in the sacred love
      Of knowledge, truth, and thee;
    And let our hills and valleys shout
      The songs of liberty.

4   Here may religion pure and mild
      Smile on our Sabbath hours;
    And piety and virtue bless
      The home of us and ours.

5   Lord of the nations, thus to thee
      Our country we commend;
    Be thou her refuge and her trust,
      Her everlasting friend.

The God of our Fathers.


1   Like Israel's hosts to exile driven,
      Across the flood the pilgrims fled;
    Their hands bore up the ark of Heaven,
      And Heaven their trusting footsteps led,
    Till on these savage shores they trod,
    And won the wilderness for God.

2   Then, where their weary ark found rest,
      Another Zion proudly grew;
    In more than Judah's glory dressed,
      With light that Israel never knew.
    From sea to sea her empire spread,
    Her temple Heaven, and Christ her head.

3   Then let the grateful church, to-day
      Its ancient rite with gladness keep;
    And still our fathers' God display
      His kindness, though the fathers sleep.
    O, bless, as thou hast blessed the past,
    While earth, and time, and heaven shall last.

"Thou shall teach them to thy children."


1   Let children hear the mighty deeds
      Which God performed of old:
    Which in our younger years we saw,
      And which our fathers told.

2   He bids us make his glories known--
      His works of power and grace;
    And we'll convey his wonders down
      To every rising race.

3   Our lips shall tell them to our sons,
      And they again to theirs;
    That generations yet unborn
      May teach them to their heirs.

4   Thus shall they learn, in God alone
      Their hope securely stands;
    That they may ne'er forget his works,
      But practise his commands.

"We have a goodly heritage."


1   In pleasant lands have fallen the lines
      That bound our goodly heritage,
    And safe beneath our sheltering vines
      Our youth is blest, and soothed our age.

2   What thanks, O God, to thee are due,
      That thou didst plant our fathers here;
    And watch and guard them as they grew,
      A vineyard, to the planter dear.

3   The toils they bore, our ease have wrought;
      They sowed in tears--in joy we reap;
    The birthright they so dearly bought
      We'll guard, till we with them shall sleep.

4   Thy kindness to our fathers shown
      In weal and woe through all the past,
    Their grateful sons, O God, shall own
      While here their name and race shall last.

God Acknowledged in National Blessings.


1   Great God of nations, now to thee
      Our hymn of gratitude we raise;
    With humble heart and bending knee,
      We offer thee our song of praise.

2   Here freedom spreads her banner wide,
      And casts her soft and hallowed ray;
    Here thou our fathers' steps didst guide
      In safety through their dangerous way.

3   We praise thee that the gospel's light
      Through all our land its radiance sheds,
    Dispels the shades of error's night,
      And heavenly blessings round us spreads.

4   Great God, preserve us in thy fear;
      In dangers still our guardian be;
    O, spread thy truth's bright precepts here,
      Let all the people worship thee.

Remembrance of our Fathers.


1   Great God! beneath whose piercing eye
    The world's extended kingdoms lie;
    Whose favoring smile upholds them all,
    Whose anger smites them, and they fall;

2   We bow before thy heavenly throne;
    Thy power we see, thy goodness own;
    But, cherished by thy milder voice,
    Our bosoms tremble and rejoice.

3   Thy kindness to our fathers shown,
    Their children's children long shall own;
    To thee with grateful hearts shall raise
    Their tribute of exulting praise.

4   Our God, our Guardian, and our Friend!
    Oh still thy sheltering arm extend;
