NOTES AND SUGGESTIONS

Under No. 5 fail not to compare length of time covered by different
books. Under No. 7 ask pupils to show the appropriateness. Under No. 9
teacher may require committal of location or not, as is deemed
advisable. Under No. 12 show the truth of these universal lessons
through the march of history. Under No. 13 copy the references, be able
to explain their meaning, and to show the likeness between the symbol,
the type, and Christ. In copying this outline work the pupil may or may
not omit the names of the fourteen topics, according to the teacher's
judgment. For the inspection of friends it would be preferable to have
the words of these topics repeated with each outline, as in Genesis. As
an aid to concert recitation let the teacher place the topics of the
outline upon the blackboard and repeat names and answers together.
