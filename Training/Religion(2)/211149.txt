26.

  Forgive, O Lord, for Thy dear Son
  The ill that I this day have done.
  That with the world, myself, and Thee
  I, ere I sleep, at peace may be. Amen.


27.

  Watch o'er a little child to-night,
  Blest Savior from above,
  And keep me till the morning light
  Within Thine arms of love. Amen.


28.

  Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me:
  Bless Thy little child to-night;
  Through the darkness be Thou near me,
  Keep me safe till morning light.

  All this day Thy hand has led me,
  And I thank Thee for Thy care;
  Thou hast warmed me, clothed me, fed me;
  Listen to my evening prayer.

  May my sins be all forgiven;
  Bless the friends I love so well;
  Take me, Lord, at last to heaven.
  Happy there with Thee to dwell. Amen.


29.

  Lord, send me sleep that I may live;
  The wrongs I've done this day forgive.
  Bless every deed and thought and word
  I've rightly done, or said, or heard.
  Bless relatives and friends alway;
  Teach all the world to watch and pray.
  My thanks for all my blessings take
  And hear my prayer for Jesus' sake.
  Amen.


30.

  Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide,
  The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!
  When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
  Help of the helpless, O abide with me! Amen.


31.

  At the close of every day,
  Lord, to Thee I kneel and pray.
  Look upon Thy little child,
  Look in love and mercy mild.
  O forgive and wash away
  All my naughtiness this day,
  And both when I sleep and wake
  Bless me for my Savior's sake. Amen.


32.

  Lord, I have passed another day
  And come to thank Thee for Thy care.
  Forgive my faults in work or play
  And listen to my evening prayer.
  Thy favor gives me daily bread
  And friends, who all my wants supply:
  And safely now I rest my head,
  Preserved and guarded by Thine eye.
  Amen.


33.

  All praise to Thee, my God, this night
  For all the blessings of the light:
  Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,
  Beneath Thine own almighty wings. Amen.


34.

  I fall asleep in Jesus' wounds,
  There pardon for my sins abounds;
  Yea, Jesus' blood and righteousness
  My jewels are, my glorious dress,
  Wherein before my God I'll stand
  When I shall reach the heavenly land.
  Amen.


35.

  The toils of day are over;
  I lift my heart to Thee
  And ask that free from peril
  The hours of night may be.
  O Jesus, make their darkness light
  And guard me through the coming night. Amen.


36.

O Lord God, I pray Thee, for Christ's sake, forgive me whatsoever I have
done wrong this day and keep me safe all the night while I am asleep. Amen.


37.

I thank Thee, my heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son, that
Thou hast graciously kept me this day; and I pray Thee that Thou wouldst
forgive me all my sins where I have done wrong, and graciously keep me this
night. For into Thy hands I commend myself, my body and soul, and all
things. Let Thy holy angel be with me, that the wicked Foe may have no
power over me. Amen.
