  'Tis no delight to me.

"They've had to treat him cruelly
  To teach him how to play;
They've had to whip and punish him
  And take his food away.

"And that is why I do not love
  To see him dancing so;
And if you thought of it, my boy,
  You'd feel with me, I know."




THE SHEEP IN HEAVEN.


[Illustration: Letter C.]

"Come to the window, mother!
  Look out, and you will see
How fast these little clouds sail on,
  Above our old elm tree!

"And tell me, dearest mother,
  Are these the sheep of heaven,
That in that land are feeding,
  From morning until even?

"How soft and white and shining!
  Oh! say, dear mother, there
Is everything so gentle,
  So lovely and so fair?"

"We cannot see them, darling,
  The sheep of heaven, here;
And far more beautiful than this
  Does that bright land appear.

"Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard,
  Nor tongue of man can tell
The glories of that home above,
  Where all the good shall dwell."

TWILIGHT.


[Illustration: Letter T.]

The happiest hour of all the day
  To me, is always last;
When both my studies and my play,
  My walks and work, are past.

When round the bright warm fire we come,
  With hearts so light and free,
And all within our happy home
  Are talking quietly,

Then, by my dear, kind father's side
  I sit, or on his knee,
And then I tell him I have tried
  His gentle girl to be.

And then he says the little child
  Is loved by every one,
Who has a temper sweet and mild
  And smiling as the sun.

Let me do always as I should,
  Nor vex my father dear;
And let me be as glad and good
  As he would have me here.

THE WRONG STORY.


[Illustration]

"My little Edward, how could you
Tell me a thing that was not true?
And make me feel thus grieved and sad
To find I have a child so bad?

"And then, to do a deed so mean,
And wish by that yourself to screen!
Would you have had me blame poor Tray,
And send him from the fire away?

"O! never, when you've disobeyed,
Or by your mischief trouble made,
Think that a wicked act is right
Because you hide it from my sight.

"It will be always seen by One,
Who knows each wrong that you have done;
And I shall know it too, no doubt,
For sin must always find you out.

"I cannot let you here to-day
With me and little sisters stay;
But you must go up stairs alone,
Till you a better boy have grown."

THE BALLAD.


[Illustration: Letter C.]

"Come hither, little brothers,
  And listen now to me,
And I will read a story
  To both, while at my knee."

Then Johnnie's flag hung idly,
  And Charlie hushed his drum;
To hear sweet Mary's story
  The mimic soldiers come.

"'Tis of a boy no larger,
  My little Charles, than you;
But he had been in battle,
  And all its terrors knew.

"His father was a captain;
  He had no child beside;
And while he was an infant
  His mother dear had died.

"And so from camp to battle,
  From fight to camp again,
Had lived, this little hero,
  On many a bloody plain.

"One day, when shouts were loudest
  Upon the reddened field,--
When came the victor's war-cry,
  'See! see! they fly! they yield!'--

"Forth then, to seek his father,
  He went with eager joy;
But with a chance ball wounded,
  Low lay the fearless boy!

"The son of a brave chieftain,
  He made no sigh or groan;
His father's hand yet tighter
  He clasped within his own!

"And so, when strife was ended,
  No more to be begun,
In conquest's very moment
  Thus fell the chieftain's son."

Then John took out his feather,
  And put his flag away;
And Charlie's drum was silent
  Until another day.

THE CHILD'S QUESTION.


[Illustration: Letter W.]

"What are the flowers for, mamma,
  That spring up fresh and bright,
And grow on every hill and plain,
  Where'er I turn my sight?

"How do the flowers grow, mamma?
  I've pulled the leaves away,
And tried to see them blossom out,
  On many a summer's day."

"The flowers were made, my little child,
  That when our footsteps trod
Upon the green and pleasant fields,
  We then might think of God.

"We may not see how they do grow,
  And bloom in beauty fair;
We cannot tell how they can spread
  Their small leaves to the air:

"But yet we know that God's kind hand
  Creates these little flowers,
And makes the warm sun shine on them,
  And waters them with showers.

"And so we love to think that He,
  Who paints their sweet leaves thus,
Who sends the sunshine and the rain,
  Has thought and care for us."






SUNDAY NIGHT.


[Illustration: Letter T.]

The holy Sabbath day has fled;
  And has it been well spent?
Have I remembered what was said,
  And why the day was sent?

May I be better all the week,
  For what to-day has taught;
May I God's love and favor seek,
  And do the things I ought!






HAGAR AND ISHMAEL.


[Illustration: T.]

'Twas morning, and the pleasant light
Shone on the hills, the trees, the flowers,
And made a far-off country bright,
A lovely land, but not like ours.

A mother led her little child
Forth from his father's door away;
And with the flowers he played, and smiled
As beautiful and bright as they.

But when, at noon, the warm sun beat
Upon the sweet boy's forehead fair,
Tired and thirsty from the heat,
He asked in vain for water there.
