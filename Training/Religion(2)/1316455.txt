Jesus, Master! pass not by me;
  Son of David! pity me.

2 While I sit in weary blindness,
  Longing for the blessed light,
Many taste thy loving kindness;
  "Lord! I would receive my sight."

3 I would see thee and adore thee,
  And thy word the power can give;
Hear the sightless soul implore thee;
  Let me see thy face and live.

4 Ah! what touch is this that thrills me?
  What this burst of strange delight?
Lo! the rapturous vision fills me!
  This is Jesus! this is sight!

5 Room, ye saints that throng behind him!
  Let me follow in the way;
I will teach the blind to find him
  Who can turn their night to day.

254     Bartimeus. 8s & 7s.

_The Blind Man Healed._     (521)

"Mercy, oh, thou Son of David!"
  Thus blind Bartimeus prayed;
"Others by thy word are saved,
  Now to me afford thine aid."

2 Many for his crying chid him,--
  But he called the louder still;
Till the gracious Savior bade him,--
  "Come, and ask me what you will."

3 Money was not what he wanted,
  Though by begging used to live;
But he asked, and Jesus granted,
  Alms which none but he could give.

4 "Lord! remove this grievous blindness,
  Let mine eyes behold the day!"
Straight he saw, and, won by kindness,
  Followed Jesus in the way.

5 Oh! methinks I hear him praising,
  Publishing to all around,
"Friends! is not my case amazing?
  What a Savior I have found!

6 "Oh! that all the blind but knew him,
  And would be advised by me!
Surely would they hasten to him,
  He would cause them all to see."

     John Newton, 1779.


255     Sitting at the Feet of Jesus. P.M.

Oh, the peace that fills my soul,
  Sitting at the feet of Jesus;
Cleansed from sin, made free and whole,
  Sitting at the feet of Jesus.

Cho.--This is my abiding place,
        Clothed with his abounding grace,
      Looking upward to his face,
        Sitting at the feet of Jesus.

2 Christ is mine in storm and calm,
  Sitting at the feet of Jesus;
All my wounds are filled with balm,
  Sitting at the feet of Jesus.

3 Here I rest from toil and strife,
  Sitting at the feet of Jesus;
Safe beneath the Tree of Life,
  Sitting at the feet of Jesus.

4 Come ye guilty and be healed,
  Sitting at the feet of Jesus;
Freely is God's love revealed,
  Sitting at the feet of Jesus.

Forever here my rest shall be,
  Close to thy bleeding side;
'Tis all my hope and all my plea,
  "For me the Savior died."

2 My dying Savior and my God,
  Fountain for guilt and sin,
Sprinkle me ever with thy blood,
  And cleanse and keep me clean.

3 Wash me and make me thus thine own,
  Wash me, and mine thou art!
Wash me, but not my feet alone,
  My hands, my head, my heart!

4 Th' atonement of thy blood apply
  Till faith to sight improve,
Till hope in full fruition die,
  And all my soul be love.

_The Believer's Rest._     (654)

Lord, I believe a rest remains
  To all thy people known;
A rest where pure enjoyment reigns,
  And thou art loved alone.

2 A rest where all our soul's desire
  Is fixed on things above;
Where fear, and sin, and grief expire,
  Cast out by perfect love.

3 Oh, that I now the rest might know,
  Believe and enter in:
Now, Savior, now the power bestow,
  And let me cease from sin.

4 Remove this hardness from my heart;
  This unbelief remove:
To me the rest of faith impart--
  The Sabbath of thy love.

Oh! could I find from day to day,
  A nearness to my God;
Then should my hours glide sweet away,
  And live upon thy word.

2 Lord! I desire with thee to live.
  Anew from day to day,
In joys the world can never give,
  Nor ever take away.

3 O Jesus! come and rule my heart
  And I'll be wholly thine;
And never, nevermore depart;
  For thou art wholly mine.

4 Thus, till my last expiring breath,
  Thy goodness I'll adore;
And, when my flesh dissolves in death,
  My soul shall love thee more.

Welcome, O Savior! to my heart;
  Possess thine humble throne;
Bid every rival hence depart,
  And claim me for thine own.

2 The world and Satan I forsake,--
  To thee I all resign;
My longing heart, O Jesus! take,
  And make it all divine.

3 Oh! may I never turn aside,
  Nor from thy bosom flee;
Let nothing here my heart divide--
  I give it all to thee.

My God, I know, I feel thee mine,
  And will not quit my claim
Till all I have is lost in thine,
  And all renewed I am.

2 I hold thee with a trembling hand,
  And will not let thee go,
Till steadfastly by faith I stand
  And all thy goodness know.

3 Jesus, thine all-victorious love
  Shed in my heart abroad:
Then shall my feet no longer rove,
  Rooted and fixed in God.

4 Refining fire, go through my heart,
  Illuminate my soul;
Scatter thy life through every part,
  And sanctify the whole.

My God! accept my heart this day,
  And make it always thine,
That I from thee no more may stray,
  No more from thee decline.

2 Before the cross of him who died,
  Behold I prostrate fall;
Let every sin be crucified;
  Let Christ be All in All.

3 May the dear blood, once shed for me,
  My blest atonement prove,
That I, from first to last, may be
  The purchase of thy love.

4 Let every thought, and work, and word,
  To thee be ever given;
Then life shall be thy service, Lord!
  And death the gate of heaven.

My gracious Lord! I own thy right
To every service I can pay,
And call it my supreme delight,
To hear thy dictates and obey.

2 What is my being, but for thee,
Its sure support, its noblest end?
Thine ever-smiling face to see,
And serve the cause of such a Friend.

3 I would not breathe for worldly joy,
Or to increase my worldly good;
Nor future days or powers employ,
To spread a sounding name abroad.

4 'Tis to my Savior I would live,
To him, who for my ransom died;
Nor could all worldly honor give
Such bliss as crowns me at his side.

_God Wills Our Holiness._  (679)

He wills that I should holy be;
That holiness I long to feel;
That full divine conformity
To all my Savior's righteous will.

2 See, Lord, the travail of thy soul
Accomplished in the change of mine;
And plunge me, every whit made whole,
In all the depths of love divine.

3 On thee, O God, my soul is stayed,
And waits to prove thine utmost will;
The promise by thy mercy made,
Thou canst, thou wilt in me fulfill.

4 No more I stagger at thy power,
Or doubt thy truth, which cannot move;
Hasten the long-expected hour,
And bless me with thy perfect love.

_The Way to God._

Jesus, my all, to heav'n is gone,
He whom I fixed my hopes upon;
His track I see, and I'll pursue
The narrow way till him I view.
The way the holy prophets went,
The road that leads from banishment;
The King's highway of holiness;
I'll go, for all his paths are peace.

2 This is the way I long have sought,
And mourned because I found it not;
My grief a burden long has been,
Because I was not saved from sin.
The more I strove against its power,
I felt its weight and guilt the more;
Till late I heard my Savior say,
"Come hither, soul, I am the way."

3 Lo! glad I come; and thou, blest Lamb,
Shalt take me to thee, as I am;
Nothing but sin have I to give;
Nothing but love shall I receive.
Then will I tell to sinners round,
What a dear Savior I have found;
I'll point to thy redeeming blood,
And say, "Behold the way to God."

_Bought with a Price._

Lord, I am thine, entirely thine,
Purchased and saved by blood divine,
With full consent thine I would be,
And own thy sovereign right in me.

2 Grant one poor sinner more a place
Among the children of thy grace;
A wretched sinner, lost to God,
But ransomed by Immanuel's blood.

3 Thine would I live, thine would I die,
Be thine through all eternity;
The vow is past beyond repeal;
And now I set the solemn seal.

4 Here at that cross where flows the blood,
That bought my guilty soul for God,
Thee, my new Master now I call,
And consecrate to thee my all.

_Leaving All to Follow Christ._     (704)

Jesus, I my cross have taken,
  All to leave and follow thee;
Naked, poor, despised, forsaken,
  Thou, from hence, my all shalt be!
Perish, every fond ambition,
  All I've sought, or hoped, or known,
Yet how rich is my condition,
  God and heaven are still my own!

2 Let the world despise and leave me--
  They have left my Savior too;
Human hearts and looks deceive me--
  Thou art not, like them, untrue.
And while thou shalt smile upon me,
  God of wisdom, love, and might,
Foes may hate and friends disown me,
  Show thy face and all is bright.

3 Go, then, earthly fame and treasure;
  Come, disaster, scorn, and pain!
In thy service pain is pleasure,
  With thy favor, loss is gain.
I have called thee, Abba, Father,
  I have set my heart on thee;
Storms may howl, and clouds may gather--
  All must work for good to thee.

4 Haste thee on from grace to glory,
  Armed by faith, and winged by prayer;
Heaven's eternal day's before thee,
  God's own hand shall guide thee there.
Soon shall close thy earthly mission,
  Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days;
Hope shall change to glad fruition,
  Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.

_Desiring Sanctification._    (701)

Love divine, all love excelling,
  Joy of heaven, to earth come down;
Fix in us thy humble dwelling;
  All thy faithful mercies crown;
Jesus, thou art all compassion;
  Pure, unbounded love thou art;
Visit us with thy salvation;
  Enter every trembling heart.

2 Breathe, oh, breathe thy Holy Spirit
  Into every troubled breast,
Let us all thy grace inherit;
  Let us find thy promised rest;
Take away the love of sinning;
  Take our load of guilt away;
End the work of thy beginning;
  Bring us to eternal day.

3 Carry on thy new creation;
  Pure and holy may we be;
Let us see our whole salvation
  Perfectly secured by thee:
Change from glory into glory,
  Till in heaven we take our place,
Till we cast our crowns before thee,
  Lost in wonder, love, and praise.

_Union with Jesus._     (700)

In thy service will I ever,
  Jesus, my Redeemer, stay;
Nothing me from thee shall sever,
  Gladly would I go thy way.
Yes, Lord Jesus, I am ever
  Thine in sorrow and in joy;
Death the union shall not sever,
  Nor eternity destroy.

2 Let thy light on me be shining
  When the day is almost gone,
When the evening is declining,
  And the night is drawing on:
Bless me, oh, my Savior! laying
  Thy hands on my weary head;
"Here thy day is ended," saying,
  "Yonder live the faithful dead."

3 Stay beside me, when the stillness
  And the icy touch of death
Fill my trembling soul with chillness,
  Like the morning's frosty breath;
As my failing eyes grow dimmer,
  Let my spirit grow more bright,
As I see the first faint glimmer
  Of the everlasting light.

_Pass Me Not._     (523)

Lord! I hear of showers of blessing,
  Thou art scattering, broad and free;
Showers, the thirsty land refreshing;
  Let their fullness fall on me.

Ref.--Even me, even me,
      Let their fullness fall on me.

2 Pass me not, oh, gracious Father!
  Sinful, though my heart may be;
Thou might'st curse me, but the rather
  Let thy mercy fall on me.

3 Pass me not, oh, tender Savior!
  Let me love and cling to thee;
I am longing for thy favor;
  When thou comest, call for me.

4 Pass me not, oh, mighty Spirit!
  Thou canst make the blind to see;
Witnesser of Jesus' merit,
  Speak the word of power to me.

5 Have I long in sin been sleeping,
  Long been slighting, grieving thee?
Has the world my heart been keeping?
  Oh! forgive and rescue me.

6 Love of God, so pure and changeless,--
  Blood of God, so rich and free,--

Take me, oh, my Father! take me,
  Take me, save me, through thy Son;
That which thou would'st have me, make me,
  Let thy will in me be done.

2 Long from thee my footsteps straying,
  Thorny proved the way I trod;
Weary come I now, and praying--
  Take me to thy love, my God!

3 Fruitless years with grief recalling,
  Humbly I confess my sin;
At thy feet, O Father! falling,
  To thy household take me in.

4 Freely now to thee I proffer
  This relenting heart of mine;
Freely, life and soul I offer--
  Gift unworthy love like thine.

5 Once the world's Redeemer dying,
  Bore our sins upon the tree;
On that sacrifice relying,
  Now I look in hope to thee.

6 Father! take me; all forgiving,
  Fold me to thy loving breast;
In thy hope forever living,
  I must be forever blest!

O Jesus! full of grace,
  To thee I make my moan:
Let me again behold thy face--
  Call home thy banished one.

2 Again my pardon seal,
  Again my soul restore,
And freely my backslidings heal,
  And bid me sin no more.

3 Thine utmost mercy show;
  Say to my drooping soul--
In peace and full assurance go;
  Thy faith hath made thee whole.

Whose precious blood redeemed me
  At such tremendous cost.

Cho.--I cannot, would not,

      Will not do without thee.
      I have no strength or goodness,
      No wisdom of my own.

2 I cannot do without thee,
  I cannot stand alone;
I have no strength or goodness,
