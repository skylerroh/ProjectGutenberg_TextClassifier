   whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set
   on fire of hell."                                            Page 1

   our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that

 THE ILLUSIVENESS OF LIFE.

 HEBREWS xi. 8-10.--"By faith Abraham, when he was called to
   go out into a place which he should after receive for an
   inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
   By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange
   country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs
   with him of the same promise: for he looked for a city which hath
   foundations, whose builder and maker is God."                    77


 SERMON VII.

 Preached June 23, 1850.

 THE SACRIFICE OF CHRIST.

 2 COR. v. 14, 15.--"For the love of Christ constraineth us;
   because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all
   dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not
   henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them,
   and rose again."                                                 90


 SERMON VIII.

 Preached June 30, 1850.

 THE POWER OF SORROW.

 2 COR. vii. 9, 10.--"Now I rejoice, not that ye were made
   sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry
   after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in
   nothing. For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be
   repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death."        104


 SERMON IX.

 Preached August 4, 1850.

 SENSUAL AND SPIRITUAL EXCITEMENT.

 SERMON X.

 Preached August 11, 1850.

 SERMON XI.

 Preached February 9, 1851.

 UNITY AND PEACE.

   thankful."                                                      130


 SERMON XII.

 THE CHRISTIAN AIM AND MOTIVE.

 MATT. v. 48.--"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father
   which is in heaven is perfect."                                 143


 SERMON XIII.

 Preached January 4, 1852.

 CHRISTIAN CASUISTRY.

 1 COR. vii. 18-24.--"Is any man called being circumcised?
   let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision?
   let him not be circumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and
   uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of
   God. Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
   Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou
   mayest be made free use it rather. For he that is called in the
   Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman; likewise also he that
   is called being free, is Christ's servant. Ye are bought with a
   price; be not ye the servants of men. Brethren, let every man
   wherein he is called therein abide with God."                   156


 SERMON XIV.

 Preached January 11, 1852.

 MARRIAGE AND CELIBACY.

 1 COR. vii. 29-31.--"But this I say, brethren, the time is
   short: it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though
   they had none; and they that weep as though they wept not; and they
   that rejoice as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as
   though they possessed not; and they that use this world as not
   abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away."        169


 SERMON XV.

 Preached January 11, 1852.

 THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH A FAMILY.

 EPH. iii. 14, 15.--"Our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole
   family in Heaven and earth is named."                           181


 SERMON XVI.

 Preached January 25, 1852.

 THE LAW OF CHRISTIAN CONSCIENCE.

 1 COR. viii. 7-13.--"Howbeit there is not in every man that
   knowledge: for some, with conscience of the idol, unto this hour,
   eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being
   weak is defiled. But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither if
   we eat are we the better; neither if we eat not are we the worse.
   But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a
   stumbling-block to them that are weak. For if any man see thee
   which hast knowledge, sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not
   the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those
   things which are offered to idols; and through thy knowledge shall
   the weak brother perish for whom Christ died? But when ye sin so
   against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against
   Christ. Wherefore if meat make my brother to offend I will eat no
   flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend."
                                                                   196


 SERMON XVII.

 Preached May 16, 1852.

 VICTORY OVER DEATH.

 1 COR. xv. 56, 57.--"The sting of death is sin, and the
   strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God which giveth us
   the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."                     212


 SERMON XVIII.

 Preached June 20, 1852.

 MAN'S GREATNESS AND GOD'S GREATNESS.

 ISAIAH lvii. 15.--"For thus saith the High and Lofty One
   that inhabiteth Eternity, whose Name is Holy. I dwell in the high
   and holy place--with him also that is of a contrite and humble
   spirit."                                                        230
