TOUCHING INCIDENTS and REMARKABLE ANSWERS TO PRAYER

COMPILED BY S. B. SHAW



FIRST PREFACE

For many years in our work among children, we have felt the need of
something similar to this book.

The cuts are made especially for this work. Pictures in this book will
suggest thoughts of God and heaven and awaken desires to live pure lives
which will sooner or later result in the salvation of many of our young
readers. God bless all our readers.

--S. B. Shaw

We are sure these stories will interest you children (and most older
people, too). Especially good and true stories like these. In all that
we have selected there are precious lessons of kindness and sympathy and
obedience, gratitude, courage, and faithfulness: then there are two other
very important lessons which I wish you to learn. The first is that
children can be and should be true Christians, that is, have their sins
forgiven for Jesus' sake and their hearts changed so that they love God
and the right and hate everything that is wrong. The second lesson is
that we must be Christians to be ready to live or ready to die. You will
find in this book several accounts of happy deaths of Christian children,
and you will find also much that tells of the good done by happy Christian
children that lived.

--Mrs. S. B. Shaw.



DEDICATION

When I was a little girl about nine years old, my mother gave me the
book, "Touching Incidents and Remarkable Answers To Prayer," for children.
This book was published by Brother and Sister Shaw.

I still have that book, which is about fifty-nine years old, and I have
enjoyed the stories it contained many times. One time while teaching a
Sunday School class I gave them each one of these books. They liked them
very much, but there came a time when you could not buy these books, as
other modern books took their place. But I feel that books like this one
are still needed, and I am sure that if Brother and Sister Shaw were
living they would like to see the stories sent out again to the children.
We are adding a few more true stories.

So we are praying God's blessings upon this book and dedicating it to
the memory of Brother and Sister Shaw who printed the first book in 1895.

Yours in Him,

Laura M. Conkle

ALWAYS TELL THE TRUTH

Truthfulness is a mark of Christianity. The heathen go astray, speaking
lies as soon as they are born. In China a mother will give her boy a
reward for the best falsehood that he can tell. Beginning so early, and
regarding it such a fine thing to tell wrong stories, they become skillful
in falsehoods. Some parents in Christian America are very careless in
this matter. It made my heart ache one day when I saw a lady in a street
car trying to keep her little boy awake by telling him that, if he went
to sleep, that man who had all those teeth in his window (referring to
a dentist's office they had passed) would come into the car and pull
every tooth out of his mouth. The little fellow looked up dreadfully
scared, and did his best to keep awake: but I thought to myself, when
he finds out what a wrong story his mother has told, he will not believe
her even when she tells the truth. He will be like a little fellow of
whom I heard once, whose mother told him that if he vent to play in a
bank from which the men had been drawing sand for a building, a bear
would come out and eat him up. One day another boy tried to coax him to
go there and play, but he said, no, he was afraid of the bears. The other
boy said there were no bears. "But there be bears cause my mother said
there be bears." While they were disputing, the minister happened to
come along, and they asked him if there were bears in the sand-bank. He
told them there were none. "But," said the first little boy, "My mother
said there be bears there." "I am sorry she said so," said the minister,
"but the truth is, there are none." The child began to cry, and started
for home as fast as he could go. "O Mama!" he said, "Did you tell me a
wrong story? Did you tell me there be bears down at the sand-bank when
there aren't any?" She saw what a dreadful sin she had committed, and
she told him that she was sorry; but she was afraid that if he played
there he would get buried in the sand, and she told him that to keep him
away. "But, Mama, it is such an awful thing to tell a wrong story." "I
know it Tommy, I know it," she said, tears coming into her eyes; "and
we will ask Jesus to forgive me and I will never do it again." They knelt
down, and she was just about to pray when he said, "Wait, Mama, let me
ask Him; maybe you won't tell Him truly." That pierced her heart like a
dagger. She saw that her little boy had lost confidence in her truthfulness
even when she prayed.

THE CHILD HEROINE OF NEW BRUNSWICK

We have read a touching incident about three little children, who, last
autumn late in the season, wandered alone in a dreary region of New
Brunswick. The sun had already sunk in the west and the gloom of evening
was spreading itself over the surrounding country.

The night came on fast; and feeling sure that they could not get home
before day break, the eldest (a girl of only six years) quietly placed
the two little ones in a sheltered nook on the sea-beach; and fearing
the cold chilly night for the younger children, Mary stripped off most
of her own clothes to keep them warm.

She then started off to gather dry sea-weed, and whatever else she could
find, to cover them with. Having tenderly in this way wrought for some
time to make them a nest, she at last fell down exhausted with the cold,
and half bare to the cold inclement night.

[Illustration]

That evening the loving father and tender mother sat up wondering at
their children's long absence; the hours dragged slowly past with anxious
watching and silent listening for the well-known little pattering feet.
In vain the fond parents' eyes pierced through the darkness. At length
they roused the neighbors with their anxious inquiries after their lost
ones. All that night was passed in searching and in tears, till early
in the morning, lying fast asleep and somewhat numbed with cold, were
found little Johnny and Lizzie. But oh! a touching spectacle lay near
them; their young savior was stiff, cold, and dead on the sea-weed which
the poor little child-heroine had not strength to drag into the nook,
where those she so deeply loved, and died to save, were sleeping. Thus
this little New Brunswick girl died in her successful and self-sacrificing
endeavor to save her brother and sister.

Does not this recall the love of the Lord Jesus Christ to you who read?
Mary went to the full extent of human love in dying for her little brother
and sister. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his
life for his friends." Yet the Lord Jesus laid down his life for his
enemies; for "scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet peradventure
for a good man some would even dare to die; but God commendeth His love
toward us," etc. He makes no mistakes. Yet how many listen to this story
with more emotion and interest than they do to the story of the cross,
where the love of Jesus, the Son of God, is told in letters of blood!

--_Dawn of the Morning_



ANNIE AND VANIE'S FIRST REAL PRAYER

Two sisters, one about five years of age, the other one older, were
accustomed to go each Saturday morning, some distance from home, to get
chips and shavings from a cooper shop.

One morning with basket well filled, they were returning home when the
elder one was taken suddenly sick with cramps or cholera. She was in
great pain, and unable to proceed, much less to bear the basket home.
She sat down on the basket, and the younger one held her from falling.

The street was a lonely one occupied by workshops, factories, etc. Every
one was busy within; not a person was seen on the street.

The little girls were at a loss what to do. Too timid to go into any
workshop, they sat a while, as silent and quiet as the distressing pains
would allow.

Soon the elder girl said: "You know, Annie, that a good while ago Mother
told us that if we ever got into trouble we should pray and, God would
help us. Now you help me to get down upon my knees, and hold me up, and
we will pray."

[Illustration]

There on the side-walk did these two little children ask God to send
some one to help them home.

The simple and brief prayer being ended, the sick girl was again helped
up, and sat on the basket, waiting for the answers to their prayers.

Presently Annie saw, far down the street on the opposite side, a man
come out from a factory, look around him up and down the street and go
back into the factory.

"O sister, he has gone in again," said Annie. "Well," said Vanie, "perhaps
he is not the one God is going to send. If he is he will come back again."

"There he comes again," said Annie. "He walks this way. He seems looking
for something. He walks slow, and is without his hat. He puts his hand
to his head, as if he did not know what to do. Oh, sister, he has gone in
again; what shall we do?"

"That may not be the one whom God will send to help us," said Vanie. "If
he is, he will come out again."

"Oh yes, there he is; this time with his hat on," said Annie. "He comes
this way; he walks slowly, looking around on every side. He does not see
us, perhaps the trees hide us. Now he sees us, and is coming quickly."

A brawny German in broken accent asks:

"O children, what is the matter?"

"O sir," said Annie, Sister here is so sick she cannot walk and we cannot
get home."

"Where do you live my dear?"

"At the end of this street; you can see the house from here."
