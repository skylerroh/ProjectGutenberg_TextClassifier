he is likely to be accused of covetousness. Still people must be told
these things that they may know their duty over against their pastors.
Our Savior says: "Eating and drinking such things as they give; for the
laborer is worthy of his hire." (Luke 10:7.) And Paul says elsewhere:
"Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the
things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers
with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach
the gospel should live of the gospel." (I Cor. 9:13, 14.)


  VERSE 8. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
  corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap
  everlasting life.

This simile of sowing and reaping also refers to the proper support
of ministers. "He that soweth to the Spirit," i.e., he that honors the
ministers of God is doing a spiritual thing and will reap everlasting
life. "He that soweth to the flesh," i.e., he that has nothing left for
the ministers of God, but only thinks of himself, that person will reap
of the flesh corruption, not only in this life but also in the life to
come. The Apostle wants to stir up his readers to be generous to their
pastors.

That the ministers of the Church need support any man with common sense
can see. Though this support is something physical the Apostle does
not hesitate to call it sowing to the Spirit. When people scrape
up everything they can lay their hands on and keep everything for
themselves the Apostle calls it a sowing to the flesh. He pronounces
those who sow to the Spirit blessed for this life and the life to come,
while those who sow to the flesh are accursed now and forever.


  VERSE 9. And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we
  shall reap, if we faint not.

The Apostle intends soon to close his Epistle and therefore repeats once
more the general exhortation unto good deeds. He means to say "Let us do
good not only to the ministers of the Gospel, but to everybody, and let
us do it without weariness." It is easy enough to do good once or twice,
but to keep on doing good without getting disgusted with the ingratitude
of those whom we have benefited, that is not so easy. Therefore the
Apostle does not only admonish us to do good, but to do good untiringly.
For our encouragement he adds the promise: "For in due season we shall
reap, if we faint not." "Wait for the harvest and then you will reap the
reward of your sowing to the Spirit. Think of that when you do good and
the ingratitude of men will not stop you from doing good."


  VERSE 10. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all
  men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

In this verse the Apostle summarizes his instructions on the proper
support of the ministers and of the poor. He paraphrases the words of
Christ: "I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the
night cometh, when no man can work." (John 9:4.) Our good deeds are to
be directed primarily at those who share the Christian faith with us,
"the household of faith," as Paul calls them, among whom the ministers
rank first as objects of our well doing.


  VERSE 11. Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine
  own hand.

With these words the Apostle intends to draw the Galatians on. "I
never," he says, "wrote such a long letter with my own hand to any of
the other churches." His other epistles he dictated, and only subscribed
his greetings and his signature with his own hand.


  VERSE 12. As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they
  constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer
  persecution for the cross of Christ.

Paul once more scores the false apostles in an effort to draw the
Galatians away from their false doctrine. "The teachers you have now do
not seek the glory of Christ and the salvation of your souls, but only
their own glory. They avoid the Cross. They do not understand what they
teach."

These three counts against the false apostles are of so serious a nature
that no Christian could have fellowship with them. But not all the
Galatians obeyed the warning of Paul.

The Apostle's attack upon the false apostles was not unjustified.
Neither are our attacks upon the papacy. When we call the Pope the
Antichrist and his minions an evil brood, we do not slander them. We
merely judge them by the touchstone of God's Word recorded in the first
chapter of this Epistle: "Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any
other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him
be accursed."


  VERSE 13. For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the
  law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your
  flesh.

In other words: "I shall tell you what kind of teachers you have now.
They avoid the Cross, they teach no certain truths. They think they are
performing the Law, but they are not. They have not the Holy Spirit
and without Him nobody can keep the Law." Where the Holy Ghost does not
dwell in men there dwells an unclean spirit, a spirit that despises God
and turns every effort at keeping the Law into a double sin.

Mark what the Apostle is saying: Those who are circumcised do not
fulfill the Law. No self-righteous person ever does. To work, pray, or
suffer apart from Christ is to work, pray, and to suffer in vain, "for
whatsoever is not of faith is sin." It does a person no good to be
circumcised, to fast, to pray, or to do anything, if in his heart he
despises Christ.

"Why do the false apostles insist that you should be circumcised? Not
for the sake of your righteousness," although they give that impression,
but "that they may glory in your flesh." Now what sort of an ambition is
that? Worst of all, they force circumcision upon you for no other reason
than the satisfaction they get out of your submission.


  VERSE 14. But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
  Lord Jesus Christ.

"God forbid," says the Apostle, "that I should glory in anything as
dangerous as the false apostles glory in because what they glory in is a
poison that destroys many souls, and I wish it were buried in hell. Let
them glory in the flesh if they wish and let them perish in their glory.
As for me I glory in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." He expresses
the same sentiment in the fifth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans,
where he says: "We glory in tribulations"; and in the twelfth chapter of
the Second Epistle to the Corinthians: "Most gladly, therefore, will
l rather glory in my infirmities." According to these expressions
the glory of a Christian consists in tribulations, reproaches, and
infirmities.

And this is our glory today with the Pope and the whole world
persecuting us and trying to kill us. We know that we suffer these
things not because we are thieves and murderers, but for Christ's sake
whose Gospel we proclaim. We have no reason to complain. The world, of
course, looks upon us as unhappy and accursed creatures, but Christ
for whose sake we suffer pronounces us blessed and bids us to rejoice.
"Blessed are ye," says He, "when men shall revile you, and persecute
you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
Rejoice, and be exceeding glad." (Matt. 5:11, 12.)

By the Cross of Christ is not to be understood here the two pieces of
wood to which He was nailed, but all the afflictions of the believers
whose sufferings are Christ's sufferings. Elsewhere Paul writes: "Who
now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind
of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is
the church." (Col. 1:24.)

It is good for us to know this lest we sink into despair when our
opponents persecute us. Let us bear the cross for Christ's sake. It will
ease our sufferings and make them light as Christ says, Matthew 11:30,
"My yoke is easy, and my burden is light."


  VERSE 14. By whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.

"The world is crucified unto me," means that I condemn the world. "I am
crucified unto the world," means that the world in turn condemns me. I
detest the doctrine, the self-righteousness, and the works of the world.
The world in turn detests my doctrine and condemns me as a revolutionary
heretic. Thus the world is crucified unto us and we unto the world.

The monks imagined the world was crucified unto them when they
entered the monastery. Not the world, but Christ, is crucified in the
monasteries.

In this verse Paul expresses his hatred of the world. The hatred was
mutual. As Paul, so we are to despise the world and the devil. With
Christ on our side we can defy him and say: "Satan, the more you hurt
me, the more I oppose you."


  VERSE 15. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything,
  nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

Since circumcision and uncircumcision are contrary matters we would
expect the Apostle to say that one or the other might accomplish some
good. But he denies that either of them do any good. Both are of no
value because in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision
avail anything.

Reason fails to understand this, "for the natural man receiveth not
the things of the Spirit of God." (I Cor. 2:14.) It therefore seeks
righteousness in externals. However, we learn from the Word of God that
there is nothing under the sun that can make us righteous before God and
a new creature except Christ Jesus.

A new creature is one in whom the image of God has been renewed. Such a
creature cannot be brought into life by good works, but by Christ alone.
Good works may improve the outward appearance, but they cannot produce
a new creature. A new creature is the work of the Holy Ghost, who imbues
our hearts with faith, love, and other Christian virtues, grants us
the strength to subdue the flesh and to reject the righteousness of the
world.


  VERSE 16. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them,
  and mercy.

This is the rule by which we ought to live, "that ye put on the new man,
which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness." (Eph.
4:24.) Those who walk after this rule enjoy the favor of God, the
forgiveness of their sins, and peace of conscience. Should they ever be
overtaken by any sin, the mercy of God supports them.


  VERSE 17. From henceforth let no man trouble me.

The Apostle speaks these words with a certain amount of indignation. "I
have preached the Gospel to you in conformity with the revelation which
I received from Jesus Christ. If you do not care for it, very well.
Trouble me no more. Trouble me no more."


  VERSE 17. For I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.

"The marks on my body indicate whose servant I am. If I was anxious to
please men, if I approved of circumcision and good works as factors
in our salvation, if I would take delight in your flesh as the false
apostles do, I would not have these marks on my body. But because I
am the servant of Jesus Christ and publicly declare that no person can
obtain the salvation of his soul outside of Christ, I must bear the
badge of my Lord. These marks were given to me against my will as
decorations from the devil and for no other merit but that I made known
Jesus."

Of the marks of suffering which he bore in his body the Apostle makes
frequent mention in his epistles. "I think," he says, "that God hath set
forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are
made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men." (I Cor.
4:9.) Again, "Unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are
naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place; And labour,
working with our hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we
suffer it; being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the
world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day." (I Cor.
4:11-13.)


  VERSE 18. Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your
  spirit. Amen.

This is the Apostle's farewell. He ends his Epistle as he began it by
wishing the Galatians the grace of God. We can hear him say: "I have
presented Christ to you, I have pleaded with you, I have reproved you, I
have overlooked nothing that I thought might be of benefit to you. All I
can do now is to pray that our Lord Jesus Christ would bless my Epistle
and grant you the guidance of the Holy Ghost."

The Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior, who gave me the strength and the
grace to explain this Epistle and granted you the grace to hear it,
preserve and strengthen us in faith unto the day of our redemption. To
Him, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, be glory, world without
end. Amen.
