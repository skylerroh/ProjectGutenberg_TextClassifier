CHRISTIAN CHARACTER AND LIFE.

"Ye shall know them by their Fruits."


1   So let our lips and lives express
    The holy gospel we profess:
    So let our works and virtues shine,
    To prove the doctrine all divine.

2   Thus shall we best proclaim abroad
    The honors of our Saviour, God,
    When the salvation reigns within.
    And grace subdues the power of sin.

3   Our flesh and sense must be denied,
    Passion and envy, lust and pride,
    While justice, temperance, truth and love,
    Our inward piety approve.

4   Religion bears our spirits up,
    While we expect that blessed hope,
    The bright appearance of the Lord,
    And faith stands leaning on his word.

The Christian's Life and his Hope.


1   A soldier's course, from battles won
      To new-commencing strife;
    A pilgrim's, restless as the sun--
      Behold the Christian's life!

2   O! let us seek our heavenly home,
      Revealed in sacred lore;
    The land whence pilgrims never roam,
      Where soldiers war no more;

3   Where grief shall never wound, nor death,
      Beneath the Saviour's reign;
    Nor sin, with pestilential breath,
      His holy realm profane;

4   The land where, suns and moons unknown,
      And night's alternate sway,
    Jehovah's ever-burning throne
      Upholds unbroken day;

5   Where they who meet shall never part;
      Where grace achieves its plan;
    And God, uniting every heart,
      Dwells face to face with man.




341.              L. M.                 E. Taylor.

"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God."


1   "Thus shalt thou love the Almighty Lord,
      With all thy heart, and soul, and mind:"
    So speaks to man that sacred word,
      For counsel and reproof designed.

2   "With all thy heart;" no idol thing,
      Though close around the heart it twine,
    Its interposing shade must fling,
      To darken that pure love of thine.

3   "With all thy mind;" each varied power,
      Creative fancy, musings high,
    And thoughts that glance behind, before,
      These must religion sanctify.

4   "With soul and strength;" thy days of ease,
      While vigor nerves each youthful limb,
    And hope and joy, and health and peace,
      All must be freely brought to him.

Walking with God.


1   Thrice happy souls, who, born from heaven,
      While yet they sojourn here,
    Do all their days with God begin,
      And spend them in his fear.

2   'Midst hourly cares, may love present
      Its incense to thy throne;
    And while the world our hands employs,
      Our hearts be thine alone.

3   As sanctified to noblest ends,
      Be each refreshment sought;
    And by each various providence
      Some wise instruction brought.

4   When to laborious duties called,
      Or by temptations tried,
    We'll seek the shelter of thy wings,
      And in thy strength confide.

5   In solid, pure delights like these,
      Let all our days be past;
    Nor shall we then impatient wish,
      Nor shall we fear, the last.

Watchfulness and Prayer inculcated.


1     My soul, be on thy guard;
      Ten thousand foes arise;
    The hosts of sin are pressing hard
      To draw thee from the skies.

2     O, watch, and fight, and pray;
      The battle ne'er give o'er;
    Renew it boldly every day,
      And help divine implore.

3     Ne'er think the victory won,
      Nor lay thine armor down:
    Thy arduous work will not be done
      Till thou obtain thy crown.

4     Fight on, my soul, till death
      Shall bring thee to thy God;
    He'll take thee, at thy parting breath,
      To his divine abode.

The Beatitudes.


1   Blest are the humble souls that see
    Their emptiness and poverty;
    Treasures of grace to them are given,
    And crowns of joy laid up in heaven.

2   Blest are the souls that thirst for grace,
    Hunger and long for righteousness;
    They shall be well supplied and fed
    With living streams and living bread.

3   Blest are the pure, whose hearts are clean
    From the defiling power of sin;
    With endless pleasure they shall see
    A God of spotless purity.

4   Blest are the men of peaceful life,
    Who quench the coals of growing strife;
    They shall be called the heirs of bliss,
    The sons of God, the God of peace.

5   Blest are the sufferers who partake
    Of pain and shame for Jesus' sake;
    Their souls shall triumph in the Lord;
    Glory and joy are their reward.

Patience.


1   Patience, O, 't is a grace divine,
      Sent from the God of peace and love,
    That leans upon our Father's arm,
      As through the wilds of life we rove.

2   By patience, we serenely bear
      The troubles of our mortal state,
    And wait, contented, our discharge,
      Nor think our glory comes too late.

3   O, for this grace to aid us on,
      And arm with fortitude the breast,
    Till, life's tumultuous voyage o'er,
      We reach the shores of endless rest.

4   Faith into vision shall resign,
      Hope shall in full fruition die,
    And patience in possession end,
      In the bright worlds of bliss on high.

"Who shall abide in thy tabernacle?"  Ps. 15.


1   Who shall towards thy chosen seat
    Turn, O Lord, his favored feet?
    Who shall at thine altar bend?
    Who shall Zion's hill ascend?
    Who, great God, a welcome guest,
    On thy holy mountain rest?

2   He whose heart thy love has warmed,
    He whose will, to thine conformed,
    Bids his life unsullied run;
    He whose word and thought are one;
    Who, from sin's contagion free,
    Lifts his willing soul to thee.

3   He who thus, with heart unstained,
    Treads the path by thee ordained,
    He shall towards thy chosen seat
    Turn, O Lord, his favored feet;
    He thy ceaseless care shall prove,
    He shall share thy constant love.

1   Lord, who's the happy man, that may
      To thy blest courts repair,
    Not, stranger-like, to visit them,
      But to inhabit there?

2   'Tis he whose every thought and deed
      By rules of virtue moves;
    Whose generous tongue disdains to speak
      The thing his heart disproves;

3   Who never did a slander forge,
      His neighbor's fame to wound;
    Nor hearken to a false report,
      By malice whispered round;

4   Who to his plighted vows and trust
      Has ever firmly stood;
    And though he promise to his loss,
      He makes his promise good.

5   The man who by this steady course
      Has happiness ensured,
    When earth's foundations shake, shall stand
      By Providence secured.

"Blessed are the Meek."


1   "Blest are the meek," he said,
      Whose doctrine is divine;
    The humble-minded earth possess,
      And bright in heaven will shine.

2   While here on earth they stay,
      Calm peace with them shall dwell,
    And cheerful hope and heavenly joy
      Beyond what tongue can tell.

3   The God of peace is theirs;
      They own his gracious sway;
    And yielding all their wills to him,
      His sovereign laws obey.

4   O gracious Father, grant,
      That we this influence feel,
    That all we hope, or wish, may be
      Subjected to thy will.

1   Happy the meek, whose gentle breast,
      Clear as the summer's evening ray,
    Calm as the regions of the blest,
      Enjoys on earth celestial day.

2   His heart no broken friendships sting,
      No storms his peaceful tent invade;
    He rests beneath th' Almighty wing,
      Hostile to none, of none afraid.

3   Spirit of grace, all meek and mild,
      Inspire our breasts, our souls possess;
    Repel each passion rude and wild,
      And bless us as we aim to bless.

The Pure Heart.


1   Whatever dims thy sense of truth,
      Or stains thy purity,
    Though light as breath of summer air
      Count it as sin to thee.

2   Preserve the tablet of thy thoughts
      From every blemish free,
    While the Redeemer's lowly faith
      Its temple makes with thee.

3   And pray of God, that grace be given
      To tread time's narrow way:--
    How dark soever it may be,
      It leads to cloudless day.




351.              S. M.                     Keble.

"Blessed are the Pure in Heart."


1     Blest are the pure in heart
      For they shall see our God;
    The secret of the Lord is theirs,
      Their soul is Christ's abode.

2     Still to the lowly soul
      He doth himself impart,
    And for his temple and his throne
      Chooseth the pure in heart.

Prudence.


1   O, 't is a lovely thing to see
      A man of prudent heart,
    Whose thoughts and lips and life agree
      To act a useful part.

2   When envy, strife, and wars begin,
      In fierce, contentious souls,
    Mark how the sons of peace come in,
      And quench the kindling coals.

3   Their minds are humble, mild, and meek,
      Nor let their anger rise;
    Nor passion moves their lips to speak,
      Nor pride exalts their eyes.

4   Their lives are prudence mixed with love;
      Good works employ their day;
    They join the serpent with the dove,
      But cast the sting away.

Humility.


1   The bird that soars on highest wing
      Builds on the ground her lowly nest;
    And she that doth most sweetly sing
      Sings in the shade when all things rest:--
    In lark and nightingale we see
    What honor hath humility.

2   When Mary chose the better part,
      She meekly sat at Jesus' feet;
    And Lydia's gently opened heart
      Was made for God's own temple meet:--
    Fairest and best adorned is she
    Whose clothing is humility.

3   The saint that wears heaven's brightest crown
      In deepest adoration bends;
    The weight of glory bows him down
      Then most when most his soul ascends:--
    Nearest the throne itself must be
    The footstool of humility.




354.              C. M.                     Watts.

Humility and Submission.


1   Is there ambition in my heart?
      Search, gracious God, and see;
    Or do I act a haughty part?
      Lord, I appeal to thee.

2   I charge my thoughts, be humble still,
      And all my carriage mild;
    Content, my Father, with thy will
      And quiet as a child.

3   The patient soul, the lowly mind,
      Shall have a large reward:
    Let saints in sorrow lie resigned,
      And trust a faithful Lord.

Love to God and our Neighbor.


1   Thus saith the first, the great command,
      "Let all thy inward powers unite
    To love thy Maker and thy God
      With utmost vigor and delight.

2   "Then shall thy neighbor next in place
      Share thine affections and esteem;
    And let thy kindness to thyself
      Measure and rule thy love to him."

3   This is the sense that Moses spoke;
      This did the prophets preach and prove,
    For want of this the law is broke,
      And the whole law's fulfilled by love.

4   But, O, how base our passions are!
      How cold our charity and zeal!
    Lord, fill our souls with heavenly fire,
      Or we shall ne'er perform thy will.

Active Piety.


1     Servants of Christ, arise,
      And gird you for the toil;
    The dew of promise from the skies
      Already cheers the soil.

2     Go where the sick recline,
      Where mourning hearts deplore;
    And where the sons of sorrow pine,
      Dispense your hallowed lore.

3     Urge, with a tender zeal,
      The erring child along,
    Where peaceful congregations kneel,
      And pious teachers throng.

4     Be faith, which looks above,
      With prayer, your constant guest,
    And wrap the Saviour's changeless love
      A mantle round your breast.

5     So shall you share the wealth,
      That earth may ne'er despoil,
    And the blest gospel's saving health
      Repay your arduous toil.

Example of the Saviour.


1   And is the gospel peace and love?
      So let our conversation be;
    The serpent blended with the dove,
      Wisdom and meek simplicity.

2   Whene'er the angry passions rise,
      And tempt our thoughts or tongues to strife,
    On Jesus let us fix our eyes,
      Bright pattern of the Christian life!

3   O, how benevolent and kind!
      How mild! how ready to forgive!
    Be this the temper of our mind,
      And his the rules by which we live.

4   Dispensing good where'er he came,
      The labors of his life were love;
    If, then, we love our Saviour's name
      Thus let us our relation prove.

"Again, I say--Watch!"


1     Ye servants of the Lord,
      Each in his office wait,
    Observant of his heavenly word,
      And watchful at his gate.

2     Let all your lamps be bright,
      And trim the golden flame;
    Gird up your loins, as in his sight,
      For awful is his name.

3     Watch,--'tis your Lord's command;
      And while we speak, he's near;
    Mark the first signal of his hand,
      And ready all appear.

4     O, happy servant he,
      In such a posture found!
    He shall his Lord with rapture see
      And be with honor crowned.

The Use of Present Opportunities.


1     Children of light, awake,
      At Jesus' call arise,
    Forth with your leader to partake
      His toils, his victories.

2     Ye must not idly stand,
      His sacred voice who hear;
    Arm for the strife the feeble hand,
      The holy standard rear.

3     Nought doth the world afford,
      But toil must be the price;
    Wilt thou not, servant of the Lord,
      Then toil for paradise?

4     Awake, ye sons of light,
      Strive till the prize be won;
    Far spent already is the night;
      The day comes brightening on.

      In this their last retreat,
    Unheeded o'er their silent dust
      The storms of life shall beat.

3   Yet not thus lifeless in the grave
      The vital spark shall lie;
    O'er nature's ruins it shall rise,
      To reach its kindred sky.

4   Then heaven's soft dew o'er every eye
      Shall shed its mildest rays;
    And the long silent dust shall wake
      In strains of endless praise.

2   There is a battle to be fought,
      An upward race to run,
    A crown of glory to be sought,
      A victory to be won.

3   O, faint not, Christian, for thy sighs
      Are heard before His throne;
    The race must come before the prize,
      The cross before the crown.

The Christian Warrior.


1   The Christian warrior, see him stand
      In the whole armor of his God;
    The spirit's sword is in his hand;
      His feet are with the gospel shod.

2   In panoply of truth complete,
      Salvation's helmet on his head,
    With righteousness, a breastplate meet,
      And faith's broad shield before him spread.

3   With this omnipotence he moves;
      From this the alien armies flee;
    Till more than conqueror he proves,
      Through Christ, who gives him victory.

4   Thus strong in his Redeemer's strength,
      Sin, death and hell he tramples down,--
    Fights the good fight; and takes at length,
      Through mercy, an immortal crown.

Religion.


1   Religion! in its blessed ray
      All thought of hopeless sorrow flies,
    Despair and anguish melt away
      Where'er its healing beams arise.
    How dark our sinful world would be--
      A flowerless desert, dry and drear!
    Did not this light, O God, from thee
      Its gloom dispel, its aspect cheer.

2   Oh! by it many a heart is soothed,
      Which else would be with sorrow crushed,
    And many a dying pillow smoothed,
      And sob of parting anguish hushed.
    Across the troubled sky of time
      It doth the bow of promise bend,
    A symbol of that cloudless clime
      That waits the soul when time shall end.

3   Religion! may its holy light
      Our footsteps guide to paths of peace!
    Our solace in deep sorrow's night,
      Our stay as mortal powers decrease.
    With this our guide, we care not when
      Death's signal to depart is given;
    Its word shall bring our spirits then
      The calm and holy peace of heaven.

    On earth I have a mansion too;
    The humble spirit, and contrite,
    Is an abode of my delight.

3   "The humble soul my words revive;
    I bid the mourning sinner live;
    Heal all the broken hearts I find,
    And ease the sorrows of the mind.

    Immortal wealth and heavenly gain;
    Eternal life is his reward,

A Call to Prayer.


1   They who seek the throne of grace
    Find that throne in every place;
    If we love a life of prayer,
    God is present everywhere.

2   In our sickness, in our health;
    In our want or in our wealth,
    If we look to God in prayer,
    God is present everywhere.

    When the woes of life prevail,
    'Tis the time for earnest prayer,
    God is present everywhere.

    To thy Father, come and wait;
    He will answer every prayer,

      Hope points the upward gaze;
    And Love, celestial Love, inspires
      The eloquence of praise.

3   But sweeter far the still, small voice,
      Unheard by human ear,
    When God has made the heart rejoice,
      And dried the bitter tear.

4   No accents flow, no words ascend;
      All utterance faileth there;
    But Christian spirits comprehend,
      And God accepts the prayer.

The Warfare of the Soul.


1   Awake, my soul! lift up thine eyes!
    See where thy foes against thee rise,
    In long array a numerous host;
    Awake, my soul! or thou art lost.

2   See where rebellious passions rage,
    And fierce desires and lusts engage;
    The meanest foe of all the train
    Has thousands and ten thousands slain.

3   Come then, my soul! now learn to wield
    The weight of thine immortal shield;
    Put on the armor from above,
    Of heavenly truth and heavenly love.

4   The terror and the charm repel,
    And powers of earth and powers of hell,
    The man of Calvary triumphed here;--
    Why should his faithful followers fear?

The Christian Race.


1   Awake, my soul! stretch every nerve,
      And press with vigor on;
    A heavenly race demands thy zeal,
      And an immortal crown.

2   A cloud of witnesses around
      Hold thee in full survey;
    Forget the steps already trod,
      And onward urge thy way.

3   'T is God's all-animating voice
      That calls thee from on high;
    'T is his own hand presents the prize
      To thine aspiring eye;--

4   That prize with peerless glories bright,
      Which shall new lustre boast,
    When victors' wreaths and monarchs' gems
      Shall blend in common dust.




369.              C. M.                     Watts.

Christian Courage and Self-denial.


1   Am I a soldier of the cross,
      A follower of the Lamb?
    And shall I fear to own his cause,
      Or blush to speak his name?

2   Must I be carried to the skies
      On flowery beds of ease,
    While others fought to win the prize,
      And sailed through bloody seas?

3   Sure I must fight, if I would reign;
      Increase my courage, Lord!
    I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
      Supported by thy word.

4   Thy saints, in all this glorious war,
      Shall conquer, though they're slain:
    They see the triumph from afar,
      And soon with Christ shall reign.

5   When that illustrious day shall rise,
      And all thy armies shine
    In robes of victory through the skies,
      The glory shall be thine.




370.              L. M.                     Watts.

The Christian Race.


1   Awake, our souls, away, our fears;
      Let every trembling thought be gone;
    Awake and run the heavenly race,
      And put a cheerful courage on.

2   True 'tis a strait and thorny road,
      And mortal spirits tire and faint;
    But they forget the mighty God,
      That feeds the strength of every saint.

3   From thee, the overflowing spring,
      Our souls shall drink a fresh supply,
    While such as trust their native strength,
      Shall melt away, and droop, and die.

4   Swift as an eagle cuts the air,
      We'll mount aloft to thine abode;
    On wings of love our souls shall fly,
      Nor tire amidst the heavenly road.




371.              C. M.                Montgomery.

What is Prayer?


1   Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,
      Uttered or unexpressed,
    The motion of a hidden fire,
      That trembles in the breast.

2   Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
      The falling of a tear,
    The upward glancing of an eye,
      When none but God is near.

3   Prayer is the simplest form of speech
      That infant lips can try,
    Prayer the sublimest strains that reach
      The Majesty on high.

4   Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,
      The Christian's native air,
    The watchword at the gates of death;
      He enters heaven with prayer.

5   Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice,
      Returning from his ways;
    While angels in their songs rejoice,
      And cry "Behold, he prays!"




372.             7s. M.               Mrs. Hemans.

"I will that men pray everywhere."


1   Child, amidst the flowers at play,
    While the red light fades away;
    Mother, with thine earnest eye
    Ever following silently;
    Father, by the breeze of eve
    Called thy daily work to leave;
    Pray! ere yet the dark hours be,
    Lift the heart and bend the knee!

2   Traveller, in the stranger's land,
    Far from thine own household band;
    Mourner, haunted by the tone
    Of a voice from this world gone;
    Captive, in whose narrow cell
    Sunshine hath not leave to dwell;
    Sailor, on the darkening sea--
    Lift the heart and bend the knee!




373.          7s. & 6s. M.      Edin. Lit. Review.

Pray without ceasing.


1   Go when the morning shineth,
      Go when the noon is bright,
    Go when the eve declineth,
      Go in the hush of night;
    Go with pure mind and feeling,
      Cast earthly thought away,
    And, in thy closet kneeling,
      Do thou in secret pray.

2   Remember all who love thee,
      All who are loved by thee;
    Pray, too, for those who hate thee,
      If any such there be;
    Then for thyself, in meekness,
      A blessing humbly claim,
    And blend with each petition
      Thy great Redeemer's name.

3   Or, if 'tis e'er denied thee
      In solitude to pray,
    Should holy thoughts come o'er thee
      When friends are round thy way,
    E'en then the silent breathing,
      Thy spirit raised above,
    Will reach his throne of glory,
      Where dwells eternal love.

4   O, not a joy or blessing
      With this can we compare,--
    The grace our Father gave us
      To pour our souls in prayer:
    Whene'er thou pin'st in sadness,
      Before his footstool fall;
    Remember, in thy gladness,
      His love who gave thee all.




374.              L. M.                     Watts.

"We walk by faith, not by sight."


1   'T is by the faith of joys to come
      We walk through deserts dark as night;
    Till we arrive at heaven, our home,
      Faith is our guide, and faith our light.

2   The want of sight she well supplies;
      She makes the pearly gates appear;
    Far into distant worlds she flies,
      And brings eternal glories near.

3   Cheerful we tread the desert through,
      While faith inspires a heavenly ray;
    Though lions roar and tempests blow,
      And rocks and dangers fill the way.

4   So Abraham, by divine command,
      Left his own house to walk with God;
    His faith beheld the promised land,
