_Evening Prayer_.

Fading, still fading, the last beam is shining;
Father in heaven, the day is declining;
Safety and innocence flee with the light,
Temptation and danger walk forth with the night.
From the fall of the shade till the morning bells chime,
Shield us from danger, keep us from crime.

Ref.--Father, have mercy,
      Father, have mercy,
      Father, have mercy, thro' Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

2 Father in heaven, O hear when we call;
Hear, for Christ's sake, who is Savior of all.
Feeble and fainting, we trust in thy might;
In doubting and darkness thy love be our light;
Let us sleep on thy breast while the night taper burns,
Wake in thine arms when morning returns.

61     God Be With You. P.M.

_Parting Blessing._

God be with you till we meet again,
By his counsels guide, uphold you,
With his sheep securely fold you,
God be with you till we meet again

Cho.--Till we meet, till we meet,
      Till we meet at Jesus' feet;
      Till we meet, till we meet,
      God be with you till we meet again.

2 God be with you till we meet again,
'Neath his wings securely hide you,
Daily manna still provide you,
God be with you till we meet again.

3 God be with you till we meet again,
When life's perils thick confound you,
Put his arms unfailing round you,
God be with you till we meet again.

4 God be with you till we meet again,
Keep love's banner floating o'er you,
Smite death's threat'ning wave before you,
God be with you till we meet again.

62     Wonderful Words. P.M.

_Words of Life._

Sing them over again to me,
  Wonderful words of life,
Let me more of their beauty see,
  Wonderful words of life,
    Words of life and beauty,
    Teach me faith and duty.

Cho.--Beautiful words, wonderful words,
        Wonderful words of life,
      Beautiful words, wonderful words,
        Wonderful words of life.

2 Christ the blessed One gives to all
  Wonderful words of life;
Sinner, list to the loving call,
  Wonderful words of life;
    All so freely given,
    Wooing us to heaven.

3 Sweetly echo the gospel call,
  Wonderful words of life;
Offer pardon and peace to all,
  Wonderful words of life;
    Jesus, only Savior,
    Sanctify forever.

63     Give Me the Bible. P.M.

_The Bible Desired._

Give me the Bible, star of gladness gleaming,
To cheer the wand'rer lone and tempest-tossed;
No storm can hide that radiance peaceful beaming,
Since Jesus came to seek and save the lost.

Cho.--Give me the Bible! holy message shining,
        Thy light shall guide me in the narrow way.
      Precept and promise, law and love combining,
        Till night shall vanish in eternal day.

2 Give me the Bible, when my heart is broken,
When sin and grief have filled my soul with fear;
Give me the precious words by Jesus spoken,
Hold up faith's lamp to show my Savior near.

3 Give me the Bible, all my steps enlighten,
Teach me the danger of these realms below;
That lamp of safety, o'er the gloom shall brighten,
That light alone the path of peace can show.

4 Give me the Bible, lamp of life immortal,
Hold up that splendor by the open grave;
Show me the light from heaven's shining portal,
Show me the glory gilding Jordan's wave.

_Psalm 119._     (170)

Behold! the morning sun
  Begins his glorious way;
His beams thro' all the nations run,
  And life and light convey.

2 But, where the gospel comes,
  It spreads diviner light;
It calls dead sinners from the tombs
  And gives the blind their sight.

3 How perfect is thy word!
  And all thy judgments just;
Forever sure thy promise, Lord!
  And men securely trust.

4 My gracious God! how plain
  Are thy directions given!
Oh! may I never read in vain,
  But find the path to heaven.

     Isaac Watts, 1719.


65     Dallas. 7s.

_Book Divine._

Holy Bible, book divine,
  Precious treasure, thou art mine;
Mine to tell me whence I came;
  Mine to teach me what I am.

2 Mine to chide me when I rove;
  Mine to show a Savior's love;
Mine thou art to guide and guard;
  Mine to punish or reward.

3 Mine to comfort in distress,
  Suffering in this wilderness;
Mine to show, by living faith,
  Man can triumph over death.

4 Mine to tell of joys to come,
  And the rebel sinner's doom;
O thou holy book divine,
  Precious treasure, thou art mine.

     John Burton, 1805.


66     Evan. C.M.

_Psalm 119._     (155)

Lord! I have made thy word my choice,
  My lasting heritage;
There shall my noblest powers rejoice,
  My warmest thoughts engage.

2 I'll read the histories of thy love,
  And keep thy laws in sight,
While through the promises I rove,
  With ever fresh delight.

3 'Tis a broad land of wealth unknown
  Where springs of life arise;
Seeds of immortal bliss are sown,
  And hidden, glory lies.

4 The best relief that mourners have--
  It makes our sorrows blest;
Our fairest hope, beyond the grave,
  And our eternal rest.

     Isaac Watts, 1719.


67     Evan. C.M.

_The Latter Day._     (1018)

Lord! send thy word, and let it fly,
  Armed with thy Spirit's power;
Ten thousands shall confess its sway,
  And bless the saving hour.

2 Beneath the influence of its grace,
  The barren wastes shall rise,
With sudden flowers and fruits arrayed,--
  A blooming paradise.

3 Peace, with her olives crowned, shall stretch
  Her wings from shore to shore;
No trump shall rouse the rage of war,
  Nor murderous cannon roar.

4 Lord! for these days we wait;--these days
  Are in thy word foretold;
Fly swifter, sun and stars! and bring
  This promised age of gold.

5 Amen!--with joy divine, let earth's
  Unnumbered myriads cry;
Amen!--with joy divine, let heaven's
  Unnumbered choirs reply.

     Thomas Gibbons, 1769.


68     Evan. C.M.

_The Incomparable Richness of God's Word._   (150)

Father of mercies, in thy word
  What endless glory shines!
Forever be thy name adored
  For these celestial lines.

2 Here may the wretched sons of want
  Exhaustless riches find--
Riches above what earth can grant,
  And lasting as the mind.

3 Here the fair tree of knowledge grows,
  And yields a free repast;
Sublimer sweets than nature knows
  Invite the longing taste.

4 Here the Redeemer's welcome voice
  Spreads heavenly peace around;
And life and everlasting joys
  Attend the blissful sound.

5 Oh, may these heavenly pages be
  My ever dear delight;
And still new beauties may I see
  And still increasing light.

     Anne Steele, 1760.


69     Devizes. C.M.

_The Bible Our Light._     (149)

How precious is the book divine,
  By inspiration given!
Bright as a lamp its doctrines shine,
  To guide our souls to heaven.

2 Its light, descending from above,
  Our gloomy world to cheer,
Displays a Savior's boundless love,
  And brings his glories near.

3 It sweetly cheers our drooping hearts,
  In this dark vale of tears;
Life, light, and joy it still imparts,
  And quells our rising fears.

4 This lamp, through all the tedious night
  Of life, shall guide our way,
Till we behold the clearer light
  Of an eternal day.

     John Fawcett, 1782.


70     Devizes. C.M.

_Psalm 119._     (158)

How shall the young secure their hearts,
  And guard their lives from sin?
Thy word the choicest rules imparts
  To keep the conscience clean.

2 'Tis like the sun, a heavenly light,
  That guides us all the day;
And, through the dangers of the night,
  A lamp to lead our way.

3 Thy precepts make me truly wise;
  I hate the sinners' road;
I hate my own vain thoughts that rise
  But love thy law, my God!

4 Thy word is everlasting truth;
  How pure is every page!
That holy book shall guide our youth,
  And well support our age.

     Isaac Watts, 1719.


71     Devizes. C.M.

_Perfection of the Law and Testimony._     (154)

Thy law is perfect, Lord of light;
  Thy testimonies sure;
The statutes of thy realm are right,
  And thy commandments pure.

2 Let these, O God, my soul convert,
  And make thy servant wise;
Let those be gladness to my ears--
  The dayspring to mine eyes.

3 By these may I be warned betimes;
  Who knows the guile within?
Lord, save me from presumptuous crimes;
  Cleanse me from secret sin.

4 So may the words my lips express--
  The thoughts that throng my mind--
O Lord, my strength and righteousness,
  With thee acceptance find.

     C. Wesley.


72     Manoah. C.M.

_Faithfulness._

Begin, my tongue, some heavenly theme,
  And speak some boundless thing;
The mighty works or mightier name
  Of our eternal King.

2 Tell of his wondrous faithfulness,
  And sound his power abroad;
Sing the sweet promise of his grace,
  And the performing God.

3 His very word of grace is strong,
  As that which built the skies;
The voice that rolls the stars along,
  Speaks all the promises.

4 Oh, might I hear thy heavenly tongue
  But whisper, "Thou art mine!"
Those gentle words should raise my song
  To notes almost divine.

     Isaac Watts.


73     Manoah. C.M.

_Power_.

The Lord, our God, is full of might,
  The winds obey his will;
He speaks,--and, in his heavenly height,
  The rolling sun stands still.

2 Rebel, ye waves, and o'er the land
  With threatening aspect roar;
The Lord uplifts his awful hand,
  And chains you to the shore.

3 Howl, winds of night, your force combine;
  Without his high behest,
Ye shall not, in the mountain pine,
  Disturb the sparrow's nest.

4 His voice sublime is heard afar,
  In distant peals it dies;
He yokes the whirlwind to his car,
  And sweeps the howling skies.

5 Ye nations bend--in reverence bend;
  Ye monarchs, wait his nod,
And bid the choral song ascend
  To celebrate your God.

     H. Kirke White.


74     Manoah. C.M.

_Eternity._

Great God! how infinite art thou!
  What worthless worms are we!
Let the whole race of creatures bow,
  And pay their praise to thee.

2 Thy throne eternal ages stood,
  Ere seas or stars were made:
Thou art the ever-living God,
  Were all the nations dead.

3 Eternity, with all its years,
  Stands present in thy view;
To thee there's nothing old appears--
  Great God! there's nothing new.

4 Our lives through various scenes are drawn,
  And vexed with trifling cares;
While thine eternal thought moves on
  Thine undisturbed affairs.

5 Great God! how infinite art thou!
  What worthless worms are we!
Let the whole race of creatures bow.
  And pay their praise to thee.

     Isaac Watts.


75     Italy. 6s & 4s.

_The Trinity Adored._     (394)

Come, thou Almighty King!
Help us thy name to sing,
  Help us to praise;
Father all glorious!
O'er all victorious,
Come and reign over us,
  Ancient of days!

2 Come, thou incarnate Word!
Gird on thy mighty sword;
  Our prayer attend:
Come, and thy people bless,
And give thy word success;
Spirit of holiness,
  On us descend.

3 Come, holy Comforter!
Thy sacred witness bear
  In this glad hour:
Thou who almighty art,
Now rule in every heart,
And ne'er from us depart,
  Spirit of power!

4 To the great One in Three,
The highest praises be,
  Hence, evermore!
His sovereign majesty
May we in glory see,
And to eternity
  Love and adore.

     Charles Wesley, 1757.


76     All Saints. L.M.

_Praise to the Trinity_     (391)

Blest be the Father and his love,
  To whose celestial source we owe
Rivers of endless joy above,
  And rills of comfort here below.

2 Glory to thee, great Son of God!
  From whose dear, wounded body rolls
A precious stream of vital blood--
  Pardon and life for dying souls

3 We give the sacred Spirit praise,
  Who, in our hearts of sin and woe,
Makes living springs of grace arise,
  And into boundless glory flow.

4 Thus, God, the Father, God, the Son,
  And God, the Spirit, we adore;
That sea of life and love unknown,
  Without a bottom or a shore.

     Isaac Watts, 1709.


77     Elizabethtown. C.M.

_God Incomprehensible._     (844)

Thy way, O God! is in the sea,
  Thy paths I cannot trace;
Nor comprehend the mystery
  Of thine unbounded grace.

2 'Tis but in part I know thy will;
  I bless thee for the sight;
When will thy love the rest reveal,
  In glory's clearer light?

3 Here the dark veils of flesh and sense
  My captive soul surround;
Mysterious deeps of providence
  My wondering thoughts confound.

4 As through a glass I dimly see
  The wonders of thy love;
How little do I know of thee,
  Or of the joys above!

5 With rapture I shall soon survey
  Thy providence and grace;
And spend an everlasting day
  In wonder, love, and praise.

     John Fawcett, 1782.


78     Elizabethtown. C.M.

_Eternity of God._     (1071)

O God! our help in ages past,
  Our hope for years to come;
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
  And our eternal home.

2 Under the shadow of thy throne,
  Still may we dwell secure;
Sufficient is thine arm alone,
  And our defense is sure.

3 Before the hills in order stood,
  Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting thou art God,
  To endless years the same.

4 A thousand ages in thy sight
  Are like an evening gone;
Short as the watch that ends the night,
  Before the rising sun.

5 The busy tribes of flesh and blood,
  With all their cares and fears,
Are carried downward by the flood,
  And lost in following years.

     Isaac Watts, 1719.


79     Elizabethtown. C.M.

_Divine Perfections._     (182)

I sing th' almighty power of God,
  That made the mountains rise,
That spread the flowing seas abroad,
  And built the lofty skies.

2 I sing the wisdom that ordained
  The sun to rule the day;
The moon shines full at his command,
  And all the stars obey.

3 I sing the goodness of the Lord,
  That filled the earth with food;
He formed the creatures with his word,
  And then pronounced them good.

4 Lord! how thy wonders are displayed
  Where'er I turn mine eye!
If I survey the ground I tread,
  Or gaze upon the sky.

     Isaac Watts.
