    The laying of the corner-stone of The Mother Church.


    Laus Deo, it is done!
    Rolled away from loving heart
        Is a stone.
    Lifted higher, we depart,
        Having one.

    _Laus Deo_,--on this rock
    (Heaven chiseled squarely good)
        Stands His church,--
    God is Love, and understood
        By His flock.

    _Laus Deo_, night star-lit
    Slumbers not in God's embrace;
        Be awake;
    Like this stone, be in thy place:
        Stand, not sit.

    Grave, silent, steadfast stone,
    Dirge and song and shoutings low
        In thy heart
    Dwell serene,--and sorrow? No,
    It has none,
        _Laus Deo!_




_OUR NATIONAL THANKSGIVING HYMN_


    God of the rolling year! to Thee we raise
    A nation's holiest hymn in grateful praise!
    Plenty and peace abound at Thy behest,
    Yet wherefore this Thy love? Thou knowest best!

    Thou who, impartial, blessings spreadst abroad,
    Thou wisdom, Love, and Truth,--divinely God!
    Who giveth joy and tears, conflict and rest,
    Teaching us thus of Thee, who knowest best!

    Ruler Supreme! to Thee we'll meekly bow,
    When we have learned of Truth what Thou doest now--
    Why from this festive hour some dear lost guest
    Bears hence its sunlit glow--Thou knowest best!

    How have our honored dead fought on in gloom!
    Peace her white wings will spread over their tomb;
    Why waited their reward, triumph and rest,
    Till molds the hero form? Thou knowest best!

    Shades of our heroes! the Union now is one,
    The star whose destiny none may outrun;
    Tears of the bleeding slave poured on her breast,
    When to be wiped away, Thou knowest best!

    Thou who in the Christ hallowed its grief,--
    O meekest of mourners, while yet the chief,--
    Give to the pleading hearts comfort and rest,
    In that benediction which knoweth best!

    Lynn, Mass., _December 7, 1865_.




_SATISFIED_


    It matters not what be thy lot,
        So Love doth guide;
    For storm or shine, pure peace is thine,
        Whate'er betide.

    And of these stones, or tyrants' thrones,
        God able is
    To raise up seed--in thought and deed--
        To faithful His.

    Aye, darkling sense, arise, go hence!
        Our God is good.
    False fears are foes--truth tatters those,
        When understood.

    Love looseth thee, and lifteth me,
        Ayont hate's thrall:
    There Life is light, and wisdom might,
        And God is All.

    The centuries break, the earth-bound wake,
        God's glorified!
    Who doth His will--His likeness still--
        Is satisfied.

    Pleasant View, Concord, N. H., _January, 1900_.
