of health are strictly enforced, great caution is observed
in regard to diet, and the conversation chiefly confined
to the ailments of the body, there is the most sickness.
Take a large family of children where the mother has
all that she can attend to in keeping them clothed and
fed, and health is generally the rule; whereas, in small
families of one or two children, sickness is by no means

[Page 7.]

the exception. These children must not be allowed to [1]
eat certain food, nor to breathe the cold air, because
there is danger in it; when they perspire, they must be
loaded down with coverings until their bodies become
dry,--and the mother of one child is often busier than [5]
the mother of eight.

Great charity and humility is necessary in this work
of healing. The loving patience of Jesus, we must
strive to emulate. "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself" has daily to be exemplified; and, although [10]
skepticism and incredulity prevail in places where
one would least expect it, it harms not; for if serving
Christ, Truth, of what can mortal opinion avail? Cast
not your pearls before swine; but if you cannot bring
peace to all, you can to many, if faithful laborers in His [15]
vineyard.

Looking over the newspapers of the day, one naturally
reflects that it is dangerous to live, so loaded with disease
seems the very air. These descriptions carry fears to
many minds, to be depicted in some future time upon [20]
the body. A periodical of our own will counteract to
some extent this public nuisance; for through our paper,
at the price at which we shall issue it, we shall be able
to reach many homes with healing, purifying thought.
A great work already has been done, and a greater work [25]
yet remains to be done. Oftentimes we are denied the
results of our labors because people do not understand
the nature and power of metaphysics, and they think
that health and strength would have returned natu-
rally without any assistance. This is not so much from [30]
a lack of justice, as it is that the _mens populi_ is not suffi-
ciently enlightened on this great subject. More thought

[Page 8.]

is given to material illusions than to spiritual facts. If [1]
we can aid in abating suffering and diminishing sin,
we shall have accomplished much; but if we can bring
to the general thought this great fact that drugs do not,
cannot, produce health and harmony, since "in Him [5]
[Mind] we live, and move, and have our being," we shall
have done more."




Love Your Enemies.


Who is thine enemy that thou shouldst love him? Is
it a creature or a thing outside thine own creation? [10]

Can you see an enemy, except you first formulate this
enemy and then look upon the object of your own conception?
What is it that harms you? Can height, or
depth, or any other creature separate you from the
Love that is omnipresent good,--that blesses infinitely [15]
one and all?

Simply count your enemy to be that which defiles,
defaces, and dethrones the Christ-image that you should
reflect. Whatever purifies, sanctifies, and consecrates
human life, is not an enemy, however much we suffer in [20]
the process. Shakespeare writes: "Sweet are the uses
of adversity." Jesus said: "Blessed are ye, when men
shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all
manner of evil against you _falsely_, for my sake; ... for
so persecuted they the prophets which were before [25]
you."

The Hebrew law with its "Thou shalt not," its de-
mand and sentence, can only be fulfilled through the
gospel's benediction. Then, "Blessed are ye," inso-

[Page 9.]

much as the consciousness of good, grace, and peace, [1]
comes through affliction rightly understood, as sanctified
by the purification it brings to the flesh,--to pride, self-
ignorance, self-will, self-love, self-justification. Sweet,
indeed, are these uses of His rod! Well is it that the [5]
Shepherd of Israel passes all His flock under His rod
into His fold; thereby numbering them, and giving them
refuge at last from the elements of earth.

"Love thine enemies" is identical with "Thou hast
no enemies." Wherein is this conclusion relative to [10]
those who have hated thee without a cause? Simply, in
that those unfortunate individuals are virtually thy best
friends. Primarily and ultimately, they are doing thee
good far beyond the present sense which thou canst entertain
of good. [15]

Whom we call friends seem to sweeten life's cup and
to fill it with the nectar of the gods. We lift this cup
to our lips; but it slips from our grasp, to fall in frag-
ments before our eyes. Perchance, having tasted its
tempting wine, we become intoxicated; become lethar- [20]
gic, dreamy objects of self-satisfaction; else, the con-
tents of this cup of selfish human enjoyment having lost
its flavor, we voluntarily set it aside as tasteless and
unworthy of human aims.

And wherefore our failure longer to relish this fleet- [25]
ing sense, with its delicious forms of friendship,
wherewith mortals become educated to gratification in
personal pleasure and trained in treacherous peace?
Because it is the great and only danger in the path
that winds upward. A false sense of what consti- [30]
tutes happiness is more disastrous to human progress
than all that an enemy or enmity can obtrude upon

[Page 10.]

the mind or engraft upon its purposes and achievements [1]
wherewith to obstruct life's joys and enhance its sor-
rows.

We have no enemies. Whatever envy, hatred, revenge
--the most remorseless motives that govern mortal mind [5]
--whatever these try to do, shall "work together for good
to them that love God."

Why?

Because He has called His own, armed them, equipped
them, and furnished them defenses impregnable. Their [10]
God will not let them be lost; and if they fall they shall
rise again, stronger than before the stumble. The good
cannot lose their God, their help in times of trouble.
If they mistake the divine command, they will recover
it, countermand their order, retrace their steps, and [15]
reinstate His orders, more assured to press on safely.
The best lesson of their lives is gained by crossing
swords with temptation, with fear and the besetments
of evil; insomuch as they thereby have tried their
strength and proven it; insomuch as they have found [20]
their strength made perfect in weakness, and their fear
is self-immolated.

This destruction is a moral chemicalization, wherein
old things pass away and all things become new. The
worldly or material tendencies of human affections and [25]
pursuits are thus annihilated; and this is the advent of
spiritualization. Heaven comes down to earth, and
mortals learn at last the lesson, "I have no enemies."

Even in belief you have but one (that, not in reality),
and this one enemy is yourself--your erroneous belief [30]
that you have enemies; that evil is real; that aught but
good exists in Science. Soon or late, your enemy will

[Page 11.]

wake from his delusion to suffer for his evil intent; to [1]
find that, though thwarted, its punishment is tenfold.

Love is the fulfilling of the law: it is grace, mercy,
and justice. I used to think it sufficiently just to abide
by our State statutes; that if a man should aim a ball at [5]
my heart, and I by firing first could kill him and save
my own life, that this was right. I thought, also, that
if I taught indigent students gratuitously, afterwards
assisting them pecuniarily, and did not cease teachi
ing the wayward ones at close of the class term, but [10]
followed them with precept upon precept; that if my
instructions had healed them and shown them the sure way
of salvation,--I had done my whole duty to students.

Love metes not out human justice, but divine mercy.
If one's life were attacked, and one could save it only [15]
in accordance with common law, by taking another's,
would one sooner give up his own? We must love our
enemies in all the manifestations wherein and whereby
we love our friends; must even try not to expose their
faults, but to do them good whenever opportunity [20]
occurs. To mete out human justice to those who per-
secure and despitefully use one, is not leaving all retribu-
tion to God and returning blessing for cursing. If special
opportunity for doing good to one's enemies occur not,
one can include them in his general effort to benefit the [25]
race. Because I can do much general good to such as
hate me, I do it with earnest, special care--since they
permit me no other way, though with tears have I striven
for it. When smitten on one cheek, I have turned the
other: I have but two to present. [30]

I would enjoy taking by the hand all who love me not,
and saying to them, "_I_ love _you_, and would not know-

[Page 12.]

ingly harm you." _Because_ I thus feel, I say to others: [1]
Hate no one; for hatred is a plague-spot that spreads
its virus and kills at last. If indulged, it masters us;
brings suffering upon suffering to its possessor, through-
out time and beyond the grave. If you have been badly [5]
wronged, forgive and forget: God will recompense this
wrong, and punish, more severely than you could, him
who has striven to injure you. Never return evil for evil;
and, above all, do not fancy that you have been wronged
when you have not been. [10]

The present is ours; the future, big with events.
Every man and woman should be to-day a law to him-
self, herself,--a law of loyalty to Jesus' Sermon on the
Mount. The means for sinning unseen and unpunished
have so increased that, unless one be watchful and stead- [15]
fast in Love, one's temptations to sin are increased a
hundredfold. Mortal mind at this period mutely works
in the interest of both good and evil in a manner least
understood; hence the need of watching, and the danger
of yielding to temptation from causes that at former [20]
periods in human history were not existent. The action
and effects of this so-called human mind in its silent argu-
ments, are yet to be uncovered and summarily dealt with
by divine justice.

In Christian Science, the law of Love rejoices the heart; [25]
and Love is Life and Truth. Whatever manifests aught
else in its effects upon mankind, demonstrably is not Love.
We should measure our love for God by our love for man;
and our sense of Science will be measured by our obedience
to God,--fulfilling the law of Love, doing good to all; [30]
imparting, so far as we reflect them, Truth, Life, and Love
to all within the radius of our atmosphere of thought.

[Page 13.]

The only justice of which I feel at present capable, [1]
is mercy and charity toward every one,--just so far as
one and all permit me to exercise these sentiments toward
them,--taking special care to mind my own business.

The falsehood, ingratitude, misjudgment, and sharp [5]
return of evil for good--yea, the real wrongs (if wrong
can be real) which I have long endured at the hands of
others--have most happily wrought out for me the law
of loving mine enemies. This law I now urge upon the
solemn consideration of all Christian Scientists. Jesus [10]
said, "If ye love them which love you, what thank have
ye? for sinners also love those that love them."




Christian Theism.


Scholastic theology elaborates the proposition that
evil is a factor of good, and that to believe in the reality [15]
of evil is essential to a rounded sense of the existence of
good.

This frail hypothesis is founded upon the basis of mate-
rial and mortal evidence--only upon what the shifting
mortal senses confirm and frail human reason accepts. [20]
The Science of Soul reverses this proposition, overturns
the testimony of the five erring senses, and reveals in
clearer divinity the existence of good only; that is, of
God and His idea.

This postulate of divine Science only needs to be con- [25]
ceded, to afford opportunity for proof of its correctness
and the clearer discernment of good.

Seek the Anglo-Saxon term for God, and you will
find it to be good; then define good as God, and you
will find that good is omnipotence, has all power; it fills [30]

[Page 14.]

all space, being omnipresent; hence, there is neither place [1]
nor power left for evil. Divest your thought, then, of
the mortal and material view which contradicts the ever-
presence and all-power of good; take in only the immor-
tal facts which include these, and where will you see or [5]
feel evil, or find its existence necessary either to the origin
or ultimate of good?

It is urged that, from his original state of perfec-
tion, man has fallen into the imperfection that requires
evil through which to develop good. Were we to [10]
admit this vague proposition, the Science of man could
never be learned; for in order to learn Science, we
begin with the correct statement, with harmony and
its Principle; and if man has lost his Principle and
its harmony, from evidences before him he is inca- [15]
pable of knowing the facts of existence and its con-
comitants: therefore to him evil is as real and eternal
as good, God! This awful deception is evil's umpire
and empire, that good, God, understood, forcibly
destroys. [20]

What appears to mortals from their standpoint to be
the necessity for evil, is proven by the law of opposites
to be without necessity. Good is the primitive Princi-
ple of man; and evil, good's opposite, has no Principle,
and is not, and cannot be, the derivative of good. [25]
Thus evil is neither a primitive nor a derivative, but
is suppositional; in other words, a lie that is incapable
of proof--therefore, wholly problematical.

The Science of Truth annihilates error, deprives evil
of all power, and thereby destroys all error, sin, sickness, [30]
disease, and death. But the sinner is not sheltered from
suffering from sin: he makes a great reality of evil, iden-

[Page 15.]

tifies himself with it, fancies he finds pleasure in it, and [1]
will reap what he sows; hence the sinner must endure
the effects of his delusion until he awakes from it.




The New Birth.


St. Paul speaks of the new birth as "waiting for the [5]
adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body." The
great Nazarene Prophet said, "Blessed are the pure in
heart: for they shall see God." Nothing aside from the
spiritualization--yea, the highest Christianization--of
thought and desire, can give the true perception of God [10]
and divine Science, that results in health, happiness, and
holiness.

The new birth is not the work of a moment. It begins
with moments, and goes on with years; moments of sur-
render to God, of childlike trust and joyful adoption [15]
of good; moments of self-abnegation, self-consecration,
heaven-born hope, and spiritual love.

Time may commence, but it cannot complete, the
new birth: eternity does this; for progress is the law
of infinity. Only through the sore travail of mortal mind [20]
shall soul as sense be satisfied, and man awake in His
likeness. What a faith-lighted thought is this! that
mortals can lay off the "old man," until man is found
to be the image of the infinite good that we name God,
and the fulness of the stature of man in Christ appears. [25]

In mortal and material man, goodness seems in em-
bryo. By suffering for sin, and the gradual fading out
of the mortal and material sense of man, thought is de-
veloped into an infant Christianity; and, feeding at first
on the milk of the Word, it drinks in the sweet revealings [30]

[Page 16.]

of a new and more spiritual Life and Love. These nourish [1]
the hungry hope, satisfy more the cravings for immor-
tality, and so comfort, cheer, and bless one, that he saith:
In mine infancy, this is enough of heaven to come down
to earth. [5]

But, as one grows into the manhood or womanhood
of Christianity, one finds so much lacking, and so very
much requisite to become wholly Christlike, that one
saith: The Principle of Christianity is infinite: it is
indeed God; and this infinite Principle hath infinite [10]
claims on man, and these claims are divine, not human;
and man's ability to meet them is from God; for, being
His likeness and image, man must reflect the full
dominion of Spirit--even its supremacy over sin, sick-
ness, and death. [15]

Here, then, is the awakening from the dream of life
in matter, to the great fact that _God is the only Life_;
that, therefore, we must entertain a higher sense of both
God and man. We must learn that God is infinitely
more than a person, or finite form, can contain; that [20]
God is a divine _Whole_, and _All_, an all-pervading in-
telligence and Love, a divine, infinite Principle; and
that Christianity is a divine Science. This newly
awakened consciousness is wholly spiritual; it emanates
from Soul instead of body, and is the new birth begun [25]
in Christian Science.

Now, dear reader, pause for a moment with me, earn-
estly to contemplate this new-born spiritual altitude; for
this statement demands demonstration.

Here you stand face to face with the laws of infinite [30]
Spirit, and behold for the first time the irresistible con-
flict between the flesh and Spirit. You stand before the

[Page 17.]

awful detonations of Sinai. You hear and record the [1]
thunderings of the spiritual law of Life, as opposed to
the material law of death; the spiritual law of Love, as
opposed to the material sense of love; the law of om-
nipotent harmony and good, as opposed to any supposi- [5]
titious law of sin, sickness, or death. And, before the
flames have died away on this mount of revelation, like
the patriarch of old, you take off your shoes--lay aside
your material appendages, human opinions and doc-
trines, give up your more material religion with its rites [10]
and ceremonies, put off your _materia medica_ and hygiene
as worse than useless--to sit at the feet of Jesus. Then,
you meekly bow before the Christ, the spiritual idea
that our great Master gave of the power of God to heal
and to save. Then it is that you behold for the first [15]
time the divine Principle that redeems man from under
the curse of materialism,--sin, disease, and death.
This spiritual birth opens to the enraptured understand-
ing a much higher and holier conception of the supremacy
of Spirit, and of man as His likeness, whereby man reflects [20]
the divine power to heal the sick.

A material or human birth is the appearing of a mor-
tal, not the immortal man. This birth is more or less
prolonged and painful, according to the timely or un-
timely circumstances, the normal or abnormal material [25]
conditions attending it.

With the spiritual birth, man's primitive, sinless,
spiritual existence dawns on human thought,--through
the travail of mortal mind, hope deferred, the perishing
pleasure and accumulating pains of sense,--by which [30]
one loses himself as matter, and gains a truer sense of
Spirit and spiritual man.

[Page 18.]

The purification or baptismals that come from Spirit, [1]
develop, step by step, the original likeness of perfect man,
and efface the mark of the beast. "Whom the Lord
loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom
He receiveth;" therefore rejoice in tribulation, and wel- [5]
come these spiritual signs of the new birth under the law
and gospel of Christ, Truth.

The prominent laws which forward birth in the divine
order of Science, are these: "Thou shalt have no other
gods before me;" "Love thy neighbor as thyself," [10]
These commands of infinite wisdom, translated into
the new tongue, their spiritual meaning, signify: Thou
shalt love Spirit only, not its opposite, in every God-
quality, even in substance; thou shalt recognize thy-
self as God's spiritual child only, and the true man [15]
and true woman, the all-harmonious "male and female,"
as of spiritual origin, God's reflection,--thus as chil-
dren of one common Parent,--wherein and whereby
Father, Mother, and child are the divine Principle and
divine idea, even the divine "Us"--one in good, and [20]
good in One.

With this recognition man could never separate him-
self from good, God; and he would necessarily entertain
habitual love for his fellow-man. Only by admitting
evil as a reality, and entering into a state of evil [25]
thoughts, can we in belief separate one man's interests
from those of the whole human family, or thus attempt
to separate Life from God. This is the mistake that
causes much that must be repented of and overcome.
Not to know what is blessing you, but to believe that [30]
aught that God sends is unjust,--or that those whom
He commissions bring to you at His demand that which

[Page 19.]

is unjust,--is wrong and cruel. Envy, evil thinking, [1]
evil speaking, covetousness, lust, hatred, malice, are
always wrong, and will break the rule of Christian
Science and prevent its demonstration; but the rod of
God, and the obedience demanded of His servants in [5]
carrying out what He teaches them,--these are never
unmerciful, never unwise.

The task of healing the sick is far lighter than that
of so teaching the divine Principle and rules of Chris-
tian Science as to lift the affections and motives of men [10]
to adopt them and bring them out in human lives. He
who has named the name of Christ, who has virtually
accepted the divine claims of Truth and Love in divine
Science, is daily departing from evil; and all the wicked
endeavors of suppositional demons can never change the [15]
current of that life from steadfastly flowing on to God,
its divine source.

But, taking the livery of heaven wherewith to cover
iniquity, is the most fearful sin that mortals can commit.
I should have more faith in an honest drugging-doctor, [20]
one who abides by his statements and works upon as
high a basis as he understands, healing me, than I could
or would have in a smooth-tongued hypocrite or mental
malpractitioner.

Between the centripetal and centrifugal mental forces [25]
of material and spiritual gravitations, we go into or we
go out of materialism or sin, and choose our course and
its results. Which, then, shall be our choice,--the sin-
ful, material, and perishable, or the spiritual, joy-giving,
and eternal? [30]

The spiritual sense of Life and its grand pursuits is
of itself a bliss, health-giving and joy-inspiring. This

[Page 20.]

sense of Life illumes our pathway with the radiance of [1]
divine Love; heals man spontaneously, morally and
physically,--exhaling the aroma of Jesus' own words,
"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest." [5]





CHAPTER II. ONE CAUSE AND EFFECT.


[Page 21.]

Christian Science begins with the First Com- [1]
mandment of the Hebrew Decalogue, "Thou
shalt have no other gods before me." It goes on in
perfect unity with Christ's Sermon on the Mount, and
in that age culminates in the Revelation of St. John, [5]
who, while on earth and in the flesh, like ourselves,
beheld "a new heaven and a new earth,"--the spiritual
universe, whereof Christian Science now bears testimony.

Our Master said, "The works that I do shall ye do
also;" and, "The kingdom of God is within you." This [10]
makes practical all his words and works. As the ages
advance in spirituality, Christian Science will be seen
to depart from the trend of other Christian denomina-
tions in no wise except by increase of spirituality.

My first plank in the platform of Christian Science [15]
is as follows: "There is no life, truth, intelligence, nor
substance in matter. All is infinite Mind and its infinite
manifestation, for God is All-in-all. Spirit is immortal
Truth; matter is mortal error. Spirit is the real and
eternal; matter is the unreal and temporal. Spirit is [20]
God, and man is His image and likeness. Therefore man
is not material; he is spiritual."(1)

[Page 22.]

I am strictly a theist--believe in one God, one Christ [1]
or Messiah.

Science is neither a law of matter nor of man. It is
the unerring manifesto of Mind, the law of God, its
divine Principle. Who dare say that matter or [5]
mortals can evolve Science? Whence, then, is it, if not
from the divine source, and what, but the contempor-
ary of Christianity, so far in advance of human knowl-
edge that mortals must work for the discovery of even a
portion of it? Christian Science translates Mind, God, [10]
to mortals. It is the infinite calculus defining the line,
plane, space, and fourth dimension of Spirit. It abso-
lutely refutes the amalgamation, transmigration, absorp-
tion, or annihilation of individuality. It shows the
impossibility of transmitting human ills, or evil, from one [15]
individual to another; that all true thoughts revolve
in God's orbits: they come from God and return to
Him,--and untruths belong not to His creation, there-
fore these are null and void. It hath no peer, no comp-
petitor, for it dwelleth in Him besides whom "there is [20]
none other."

That Christian Science is Christian, those who have
demonstrated it, according to the rules of its divine
Principle,--together with the sick, the lame, the deaf, and
the blind, healed by it,--have proven to a waiting world. [25]
He who has not tested it, is incompetent to condemn it;
and he who is a willing sinner, cannot demonstrate it.

A falling apple suggested to Newton more than the
simple fact cognized by the senses, to which it seemed
to fall by reason of its own ponderosity; but the primal [30]
cause, or Mind-force, invisible to material sense, lay
concealed in the treasure-troves of Science. True,

[Page 23.]

Newton named it gravitation, having learned so much; [1]
but Science, demanding more, pushes the question:
Whence or what is the power back of gravitation,--the
intelligence that manifests power? Is pantheism true?
Does mind "sleep in the mineral, or dream in the [5]
animal, and wake in man"? Christianity answers this
question. The prophets, Jesus, and the apostles, demon-
strated a divine intelligence that subordinates so-called
material laws; and disease, death, winds, and waves,
obey this intelligence. Was it Mind or matter that spake [10]
in creation, "and it was done"? The answer is self-
evident, and the command remains, "Thou shalt have
no other gods before me."

It is plain that the Me spoken of in the First Com-
mandment, must be Mind; for matter is not the Chris- [15]
tian's God, and is not intelligent. Matter cannot even
talk; and the serpent, Satan, the first talker in its behalf,
lied. Reason and revelation declare that God is both
noumenon and phenomena,--the first and only cause.
The universe, including man, is not a result of atomic [20]
