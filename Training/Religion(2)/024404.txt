TO THE BOARD OF MANAGERS.


LADIES,

Upon your first application to me for a copy of this sermon to be
printed, I respectfully declined giving it, because it was not prepared
with the slightest reference to such a result, and more especially
because it has been my uniform practice to abstain from appearing in
this way before the public, when I could with propriety do so. To your
renewed request, and the reasons you state for making it, I feel myself
constrained to yield, although my own conviction in regard both to the
character of the discourse itself, and to the inexpediency of such
publications, except in very special cases, remains the same. If,
however, its possession, as you imply, can afford gratification to any
one interested in your most excellent institution, I ought not perhaps
to be longer influenced by a consideration which relates merely to
myself in withholding it. I therefore commit it to you, and am,

                    With the greatest respect,

                        Your friend and servant,

                            JONA. M. WAINWRIGHT.

BOSTON, OCTOBER 6, 1835.
