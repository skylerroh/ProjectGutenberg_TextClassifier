I thus with safety hide;
My Lord of life! desiring
Thy glory now to see,
Beside thy cross expiring,
I'd breathe my soul to thee.

     Paul Gerhardt, 1659.


121     Avon. C.M.

_Before the Cross._     (281)

Alas! and did my Savior bleed?
  And did my Sovereign die?
Would he devote that sacred head
  For such a worm as I?

2 Was it for crimes that I have done
  He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
  And love beyond degree!

3 Well might the sun in darkness hide,
  And shut his glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
  For man, the creature's sin!

4 Thus might I hide my blushing face
  While his dear cross appears;
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
  And melt mine eyes to tears.

5 But drops of grief can ne'er repay
  The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord, I give myself away;
  'Tis all that I can do.

     Isaac Watts, 1709.

Cho.--Jesus died for you,
      And Jesus died for me,
      Yes, Jesus died for all mankind;
      Bless God, salvation's free.

Cho.--Help me, dear Savior, thee to own,
        And ever faithful be;
      And when thou sittest on thy throne.
        O Lord, remember me.


122     Avon. C.M.

_Jesus Died for Me._

Great God, when I approach thy throne
  And all thy glory see;
This is my stay, and this alone,
  That Jesus died for me.

2 How can a soul condemned to die,
  Escape the just decree?
Helpless and full of sin am I,
  But Jesus died for me.

3 Burdened with sin's oppressive chain,
  Oh, how can I get free?
No peace can all my efforts gain,
  But Jesus died for me.

4 And, Lord, when I behold thy face,
  This must be all my plea;
Save me by thy almighty grace,
  For Jesus died for me.

     W.B. Bathurst, d. 1877.


123     Cowper. C.M.

_Contrition at the Cross._     (283)

O Jesus! sweet the tears I shed,
  While at thy cross I kneel,
Gaze on thy wounded, fainting head,
  And all thy sorrows feel.

2 My heart dissolves to see thee bleed,
  This heart so hard before;
I hear thee for the guilty plead,
  And grief o'erflows the more.

3 'Twas for the sinful thou didst die,
  And I a sinner stand;
What love speaks from thy dying eye,
  And from each pierced hand!

4 I know this cleansing blood of thine
  Was shed, dear Lord, for me;
For me, for all--oh, grace divine!--
  Who look by faith on thee.

     Ray Palmer, 1867.


124     Cowper. C.M.

_Resting Beneath the Cross._     (277)

Oppressed with noon-day's scorching heat,
  To yonder cross I flee;
Beneath its shelter take my seat:
  No shade like this for me!

2 Beneath that cross clear waters burst,
  A fountain sparkling free;
And there I quench my desert thirst:
  No spring like this for me!

3 A stranger here, I pitch my tent
  Beneath this spreading tree;
Here shall my pilgrim life be spent:
  No home like this for me!

4 For burdened ones a resting-place
  Beside that cross I see;
Here I cast off my weariness:
  No rest like this for me!

     H. Bonar, 1857.


125     The Cross. C.M.

_The Precious Love._     (530)

The cross, the cross, the blood-stained cross!
  The hallowed cross I see;
Reminding me of precious blood
  That once was shed for me.

Cho.--Oh, the blood, the precious blood,
        That Jesus shed for me;
      Upon the cross, in crimson flood,
        Just now by faith I see.

2 The cross, the cross, that heavy cross,
  My Savior bore for me;
It bowed him to the earth with grief
  On sad Mount Calvary

3 The wounds, the wounds, those painful wounds;
  Oh, they were made for me!
His hands and feet, his holy head,
  All pierced and torn I see.

4 The death, the death, the awful death!
  That Jesus died for me;
I heard his groans, his prayer, "Forgive,"
  His bleeding side I see.

5 The love, the love, the matchless love,
  That bled upon the tree!
It melts my heart, it wins my love,
  It brings me, Lord, to thee.

     J.H. Stockton.


126     Gorton. S.M.

_Our Ransom Paid._     (296)

Our sins on Christ were laid;
  He bore the mighty load;
Our ransom price he fully paid
  In groans, and tears, and blood.

2 To save a world he dies;
  Sinners, behold the Lamb!
To him lift up your longing eyes;
  Seek mercy in his name.

3 Pardon and peace abound;
  He will your sins forgive;
Salvation in his name is found,--
  He bids the sinner live.

4 Jesus, we look to thee;--
  Where else can sinners go?
Thy boundless love shall set us free
  From wretchedness and woe.

     J. Fawcett, 1760.


127     Gorton. S.M.

_For Me He Died._     (300)

Are there no wounds for me?
  Hast thou received them all?
How can I, Lord, the anguish see,
  Beneath which thou didst fall?

2 'Tis over now, I know,--
  That suffering life of thine;
Thy precious blood has ceased to flow,
  Thou wear'st thy crown divine;

3 But yet, I weeping see
  The thorns which pierced thy head;
Thou faint'st beneath thy cross for me,
  For me to death thou'rt led!

4 Meekly, with love divine,
  Thy holy head is bent,
And streams of blood, for sins of mine,
  Flow where thy side is rent.

5 Beneath this sacred flood
  I bow my sinful soul;
Dear Savior, let thy precious blood
  Wash me and make me whole.

     Mrs. Grace Webster Hinsdale, 1868.


128     Owen. S.M.

_The Savior's Tears._     (298)

Did Christ o'er sinners weep,
  And shall our cheeks be dry?
Let floods of penitential grief
  Burst forth from every eye.

2 The Son of God in tears--
  The wondering angels see!
Be thou astonished, O my soul!
  He shed those tears for thee.

3 He wept--that we might weep--
  Each sin demands a tear;
In heaven alone no sin is found,
  And there's no weeping there.

     Benjamin Beddome, 1787.


129     Toplady. 7s, 6.

_Rock of Ages._     (515)

Rock of ages, cleft for me!
Let me hide myself in thee:
Let the water and the blood,
From thy side a healing flood,
Be of sin the double cure;
Save from wrath and make me pure.

2 Should my tears forever flow,
Should my zeal no languor know,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and thou alone;
In my hand no price I bring;
Simply to thy cross I cling.

3 While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyelids close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
See thee on thy judgment throne--
Rock of Ages cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in thee.

     Augustus M. Toplady, 1776.

Cho.--Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
      Let me hide myself in thee,
      Let me hide myself in thee.

_The Litany._     (513)

By thy birth, and by thy tears;
By thy human griefs and fears;
By thy conflict in the hour
Of the subtle tempter's power--
Savior, look with pitying eye;
Savior, help me, or I die.

2 By the tenderness that wept
O'er the grave where Laz'rus slept;
By the bitter tears that flow'd
Over Salem's lost abode--
Savior, look with thy pitying eye;
Savior, help me, or I die.

3 By thy lonely hour of prayer;
By the fearful conflict there;
By thy cross and dying cries;
By thy one great sacrifice,--
Savior, look with pitying eye;
Savior, help me, or I die.

4 By thy triumph o'er the grave;
By thy power the lost to save;
By thy high, majestic throne;
By the empire all thine own,--
Savior, look with pitying eye;
Savior, help me, or I die.

_Glorying in the Cross._    (979)

In the cross of Christ I glory,
  Towering o'er the wrecks of time;
All the light of sacred story
  Gathers round its head sublime.

2 When the woes of life o'ertake me,
  Hopes deceive, and fears annoy,
Never shall the cross forsake me;
  Lo! it glows with peace and joy.

3 When the sun of bliss is beaming
  Light and love upon my way,
From the cross the radiance streaming
  Adds more luster to the day.

4 Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure
  By the cross are sanctified;
Peace is there, that knows no measure,
  Joys that through all time abide.

     Sir John Bowring, 1825.


132     Rathbun. 8s & 7s.

_Looking to the Cross._     (980)

Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,
  Which before the cross I spend,
Life, and health, and peace possessing,
  From the sinner's dying Friend!

2 Here I'll sit, forever viewing
  Mercy's streams in streams of blood:
Precious drops, my soul bedewing,
  Plead, and claim my peace, with God.

3 Truly blessed is this station,
  Low before the cross to lie,
While I see divine compassion
  Floating in his languid eye.

4 Here it is I find my heaven,
  While upon the Lamb I gaze;
Love I much?--I've much forgiven,--
  I'm a miracle of grace.

5 Love and grief my heart dividing,
  With my tears his feet I'll bathe;
Constant still in faith abiding,--
  Life deriving from his death.

_The Price of Salvation._

When I view my Savior bleeding,
  For my sins upon the tree;
Oh, how wondrous!--how exceeding
  Great his love appears to me!

2 Floods of deep distress and anguish.
  To impede his labors, came;
Yet they all could not extinguish
  Love's eternal, burning flame.

3 Now redemption is completed,
  Full salvation is procured;
Death and Satan are defeated,
  By the sufferings he endured.

4 Now the gracious Mediator,
  Risen to the courts of bliss,
Claims for me, a sinful creature,
  Pardon, righteousness, and peace!

5 Sure, such infinite affection
  Lays the highest claims to mine;
All my powers, without exception,
  Should in fervent praises join.

6 Jesus, fit me for thy service;
  Form me for thyself alone;
I am thy most costly purchase,--
  Take possession of thine own.

     R. Lee.


134     What Hast Thou Done for Me? P.M.

_Return for Christ's Sufferings._

I gave my life for thee,
My precious blood I shed,
That thou mightst ransomed be,
And quickened from the dead;
I gave, I gave my life for thee,
What hast thou given for me?

2 My Father's house of light,
My glory-circled throne,
I left for earthly night,
For wand'rings sad and lone;
I left, I left it all for thee,
Hast thou left aught for me?

3 I suffered much for thee,
More than thy tongue can tell,
Of bitterest agony,
To rescue thee from hell;
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,
What hast thou borne for me?

4 And I have brought to thee,
Down from my home above,
Salvation full and free,
My pardon and my love;
I bring, I bring rich gifts to thee,
What hast thou brought to me?

     Frances R. Havergal.


135     Come to the Cross. P.M.

_Blessing at the Cross._

Come to the cross, where the Savior died,
Look to the Lamb that was crucified;
Turn to the mournful and tragic scene,
Gaze on the suffering Nazarene.

Cho.--Look at the Crucified, look and live!
      Look, for eternal life he will give.
      Come to the cross, where the Savior died,
      Look to the Lamb that was crucified.

2 Fall at the feet of the dying One,
Trust in the name of the Father's Son;
Wash in the fountain of Jesus' blood,
Seek for thy cure in the healing flood.

3 Fly to the arms of his pard'ning love,
Cherish the hope of a crown above;
Taste of the sweetness of sins forgiven,
Lean on the promise of rest in heaven.

     Rev. J.H. Martin.


136     Near the Cross. P.M.

_Near the Cross._

Jesus, keep me near the cross
  There a precious fountain
Free to all--a healing stream,
  Flows from Calvary's mountain.

Cho.--In the cross, in the cross,
        Be my glory ever,
      Till my raptured soul shall find
        Rest beyond the river.

2 Near the cross, a trembling soul,
  Love and mercy found me;
There the bright and morning star
  Shed its beams around me.

3 Near the cross, O Lamb of God,
  Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
  With its shadows o'er me.

4 Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
  Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
  Just beyond the river.

137     Saw Ye My Savior? P.M.

_Christ's Crucifixion._

Saw ye my Savior, saw ye my Savior,
Saw ye my Savior and God?
Oh! he died on Calvary,
To atone for you and me,
And to purchase our pardon with blood.

2 He was extended, he was extended,
Painfully nailed to the cross;
Here he bowed his head and died;
Thus my Lord was crucified,
To atone for a world that was lost.

3 Hail, mighty Savior! hail, mighty Savior!
Prince, and the Author of peace!
Oh! he burst the bars of death,
And, triumphant from the earth,
He ascended to mansions of bliss.

4 There interceding, there interceding,
Pleading that sinners may live;
Crying, "Father, I have died;
Oh, behold my hands and side!
Oh, forgive them! I pray thee, forgive!"

5 "I will forgive them, I will forgive them
When they repent and believe;
Let them now return to thee,
And be reconciled to me,
And salvation they all shall receive."

_Pardon Through the Sufferings of Christ._     (264)

Deep in our hearts let us record
The deeper sorrows of our Lord;
Behold the rising billows roll,
To overwhelm his holy soul.

2 Yet, gracious God, thy power and love
Have made the curse a blessing prove;
Those dreadful sufferings of thy Son
Atoned for sins that we have done.

3 The pangs of our expiring Lord
The honors of thy law restored;
His sorrows made thy justice known.
And paid for follies not his own.

4 Oh, for his sake our guilt forgive,
And let the mourning sinner live;
The Lord will hear us in his name,
Nor shall our hope be turned to shame.

Beneath thy cross I lay me down,
And mourn to see thy bloody crown;
Love drops in blood from every vein;
Love is the spring of all thy pain.

2 Here, Jesus, will I ever stay,
And spend my longing hours away;
Think on thy bleeding wounds and pain,
And contemplate thy woes again.

3 Oh, unmolested, happy rest!
Where inward fears are all suppressed;
Here I shall love, and live secure,
And patiently my cross endure.
