    The dark of night, the light of day.

                                   IV

    O heavenly King, in every soul,
    The darkness of our night control;
    And 'mid the blackness of that night,
    Speak Thou the word, "Let there be light."

                                    V

    And as the morn from darkness springs,
    To speed to earth on silent wings,
    A dawn more glorious shall awake,
    And bright upon our spirits break.

                                   VI

    O Sun of Righteousness, arise,
    And fill our souls with glad surprise;
    Nor into dark of night decline,
    But aye at noontide brightly shine.

                                   VII

    All glory to the God of Might,
    And to the Son, the Light of light;
    And to the Spirit, Three in One,
    Eternal while the ages run.




                                    I

    The King shall come when morning dawns,
      And light triumphant breaks;
    When beauty gilds the eastern hills,
      And life to joy awakes.

                                   II

    Not as of old, a little child
      To bear, and fight, and die,
    But crowned with glory like the sun,
      That lights that morning sky.

                                   III

    O, brighter than the rising morn,
      When He, victorious rose,
    And left the lonesome place of death,
      Despite the rage of foes;--

                                   IV

    O, brighter than that glorious morn,
      Shall this fair morning be,
    When Christ, our King, in beauty comes,
      And we His face shall see.

                                    V

    The King shall come when morning dawns,
      And earth's dark night is past;--
    O, haste the rising of that morn,
      That day that aye shall last.

                                   VI

    And let the endless bliss begin,
      By weary saints foretold,
    When right shall triumph over wrong,
      And truth shall be extolled.

                                   VII

    The King shall come when morning dawns,
      And light and beauty brings;--
    Hail! Christ the Lord; Thy people pray
      Come quickly, King of kings.




                                    I

    Think on me, Lord, for Thou art kind,
    And I am needy, poor, and blind,
    And let the gifts Thou hast in store,
    Enrich me daily, more and more.

                                   II

    I have no food my soul to feed,
    Be Thou my Bread of Life indeed;
    My parched spirit sighs, O give
    The stream of Life that I may live.

                                   III

    My filthy raiment I disown,
    Clothe with Thy righteousness alone,
    And I shall walk approved by Thee,
    Clad in Thy robe of purity.

                                   IV

    I have no strength; in evil hour
    I fall beneath temptation's power;
    Be Thou my strength, and I shall stand
    Upheld by Thine outstretched hand.

                                    V

    I cannot see the path to tread,
    And blindly by my sins am led;
    Come to my blindness, give me sight
    That I may shape my course aright.

                                   VI

    I cannot live if Thou deny
    The prayer uplifted with my cry;
    I cannot die,--in mercy give
    Thy grace, that I may die or live.

                                   VII

    Think on me, Lord, for Thou art kind,
    And I am needy, poor, and blind;
    And let the gifts Thou hast in store,
    Enrich me daily, more and more.




                                    I

    Because Thy mercy is so great,
    Lord, think upon my needy state,
    And deign to give the help I need,--
    The Bread of Life my soul to feed.

                                   II

    They cannot live whose souls are fed
    On what this foolish world calls bread;
    For lack of food the spirit sighs,
    And, weak and weary, faints and dies.

                                   III

    O may the hidden manna give
    The strength I need that I may live;
    And may that life be spent for Thee
    Who came and lived on earth for me.

                                   IV

    O Jesus Christ, the living Bread,
    Now at the table Thou hast spread,
    Think of me in my utmost need,
    And let me on Thy bounties feed.




                                    I

    I cannot lift mine eyes,
      For, O, my sin is great,--
    High as the hills that rise
      Up, up to heaven's gate,--
    I cannot lift mine eyes,
      So great my sin, so great.

                                   II

    But I would smite my breast,
      And bow me at the Cross,
    And well He knows the rest,
      My pain, my grief, my loss;--
    Yea, I would smite my breast,
      And bow me at His Cross.

                                   III

    Mayhap when I have told
      The burden of my sin,
    He'll make my spirit bold,
      And speak, and soothe, and win;--
    All this when I have told
      The burden of my sin.

                                   IV

    Then shall I lift mine eyes,
      And see the sin removed,
    And in the radiant skies
      Behold the Well Beloved;--
    Then shall I lift mine eyes,
      And see my sin removed.




                                    I

    When at Thy feet, oppressed,
      The burdened sinner falls,
    And, woeful and distressed,
      Upon Thy mercy calls,--
    O hear the penitential prayer,
    Forgive the burdened sinner there.

                                   II

    Did'st Thou not send the Son,
      To shew the Father's grace,
    To bid a world undone
      Arise and seek His face?
    And wilt Thou not in mercy say,
    "Thy many sins I take away"?

                                   III

    Yea, Thou wilt not despise
      The soul's uplifted prayer;
    Nor when our hopes arise,
      Plunge us in deep despair;
    But wilt forgive the evil done,
    Through Christ the Well Beloved Son.

                                   IV

    O Jesus Christ, by Thee
      The Father's grace is found,
    And pardon full, and we
      With every good abound,--
    We see Thee nailed upon the tree,
    And know all blessing comes from Thee.




                                    I

    Because I was brought low,
      And sin had triumphed quite,
    Thou God, all good, didst bow,
      And seek me in the night.

                                   II

    And Thou didst lift me up,
      For Thou wert lifted high,
    When on the Cross Thou gav'st
      Thyself for man to die.

                                   III

    Thou Life, Immortal Life!
      O, full of sympathy!
    Clothed with my flesh Thou cam'st
      From Thy felicity.

                                   IV

    To burst our mortal bands,
      And vanquish in the strife,
    And dead, from death arise,
      Crowned with immortal life.

                                    V

    To Father and to Son,
      To Thee, blest Spirit, praise,
    Here on the earth, and there
      Where live the endless days.




                                    I

    O God of life, in whom we live,
    The bounties of Thy favour give,
        And teach our souls to soar;
    That, at the source of every good,
    Our life may find its needful food,
        And live for evermore.
