2 Thus shall we best proclaim abroad
The honors of our Savior God;
When his salvation reigns within,
And grace subdues the power of sin.

3 Religion bears our spirits up,
While we expect that blessed hope,--
The bright appearance of the Lord;
And faith stands leaning on his word.

     Isaac Watts, 1709.


408     Essex. 8s & 7s.

_The Responsibilities of the Age._

We are living, we are dwelling,
  In a grand and awful time,
In an age on ages telling;
  To be living is sublime.

2 Hark the onset! will ye fold your
  Faith-clad arms in lazy lock?
Up! O up! thou drowsy soldier;
  Worlds are charging to the shock.

3 Worlds are charging, heav'n beholding;
  Thou hast but an hour to fight;
Now, the blazoned cross unfolding,
  On! right onward for the right.

4 On! let all the soul within you
  For the truth's sake go abroad;
Strike! let ev'ry nerve and sinew
  Tell on ages--tell for God.

     Bp. Arthur Cleveland Coxe, 1840.


409     Triumph. L.M.

_Zeal.--John 9:4._     (1009)

Go, labor on, while it is day;
  The world's dark night is hastening on;
Speed, speed thy work,--cast sloth away!
  It is not thus that souls are won.

2 Men die in darkness at your side,
  Without a hope to cheer the tomb;
Take up the torch and wave it wide--
  The torch that lights time's thickest gloom.

3 Toil on, faint not;--keep watch and pray!
  Be wise the erring soul to win;
Go forth into the world's highway;
  Compel the wanderer to come in.

4 Go, labor on; your hands are weak;
  Your knees are faint, your soul cast down;
Yet falter not; the prize you seek
  Is near,--a kingdom and a crown!

     H. Bonar, 1857.


410     Triumph. L.M.

_Psalm 41._  (819)

Blest is the man whose heart doth move,
  And melt with pity to the poor;
Whose soul, by sympathizing love,
  Feels what his fellow-saints endure.

2 His heart contrives, for their relief,
  More good than his own hands can do;
He, in the time of general grief,
  Shall find the Lord has pity too.

3 His soul shall live secure on earth,
  With secret blessings on his head,
When drought, and pestilence, and dearth
  Around him multiply their dead.

4 Or, if he languish on his couch,
  God will pronounce his sins forgiven,
Will save him with a healing touch,
  Or take his willing soul to heaven.

     Isaac Watts. 1719.


411     Rescue the Perishing. P.M.

_Seeking the Lost._

Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying,
  Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
Weep o'er the erring one,
Lift up the fallen,
  Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.

Cho.--Rescue the perishing,
        Care for the dying;
      Jesus is merciful,
        Jesus will save.

2 Tho' they are slighting him,
Still he is waiting,
  Waiting the penitent child to receive.
Plead with them earnestly,
Plead with them gently,
  He will forgive if they only believe.

3 Down in the human heart,
Crushed by the tempter,
  Feelings lie buried which grace can restore.
Touched by a loving heart,
Wakened by kindness,
  Cords that were broken will vibrate once more.

4 Rescue the perishing,
Duty demands it;
  Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide.
Back to the narrow way
Patiently win them;
  Tell the poor wand'rer a Savior has died.

     Fanny J. Crosby.


412     While the Days Are Going By. P.M.

_Daily Opportunity._

There are lonely hearts to cherish,
  While the days are going by;
There are weary souls who perish,
  While the days are going by;
If a smile we can renew,
As our journey we pursue,
Oh, the good we all may do,
  While the days are going by.

Ref.--Going by, going by,
      Going by, going by,
      Oh, the good we all may do,
      While the days are going by.

2 There's no time for idle scorning,
  While the days are going by;
Let your face be like the morning,
  While the days are going by;
Oh, the world is full of sighs,
Full of sad and weeping eyes;
Help your fallen brother rise,
  While the days are going by.

3 All the loving links that bind us,
  While the days are going by;
One by one we leave behind us,
  While the days are going by;
But the seeds of good we sow
Both in shade and shine will grow,
And will keep our hearts aglow,
  While the days are going by.

     George Cooper.


413     I Want to Be a Worker. P.M.

_Delight in God's Work._

I want to be a worker for the Lord,
  I want to love and trust his holy word;
I want to sing and pray, and be busy ev'ry day
  In the vineyard of the Lord.

Cho.--I will work, I will pray,
      In the vineyard, in the vineyard of the Lord;
      I will work, I will pray, I will labor ev'ry day
      In the vineyard of the Lord.

2 I want to be a worker ev'ry day,
  I want to lead the erring in the way
That leads to heav'n above, where all is peace and love,
  In the kingdom of the Lord.

3 I want to be a worker strong and brave,
  I want to trust in Jesus' power to save;
All who will truly come, shall find a happy home
  In the kingdom of the Lord.

4 I want to be a worker; help me, Lord,
  To lead the lost and erring to thy word
That points to joys on high, where pleasures never die,
  In the kingdom of the Lord.

     Isaiah Baltzell.


414     Seeds of Promise. C.M.

_Seedtime and Harvest._

Oh, scatter seeds of loving deeds,
  Along the fertile field,
For grain will grow from what you sow,
  And fruitful harvest yield.

CHO--Then day by day along your way,
       The seeds of promise cast,
     That ripened grain from hill and plain,
       Be gathered home at last.

2 Tho' sown in tears the weary years,
  The seed will surely live;
Tho' great the cost it is not lost,
  For God will fruitage give.

3 The harvest home of God will come;
  And after toil and care,
With joy untold your sheaves of gold
  Will all be garnered there.

     Jessie H. Brown.


415     We're Marching to Zion. S.M.

_The Christian Journey._

Come, we that love the Lord,
  And let our joys be known,
Join in a song with sweet accord,
  And thus surround the throne.

Cho.--We're marching to Zion,
      Beautiful, beautiful Zion,
      We're marching upward to Zion,
      The beautiful city of God.

2 Let those refuse to sing
  Who never knew our God;
But children of the heavenly King
  May speak their joys abroad.

3 The hill of Zion yields
  A thousand sacred sweets,
Before we reach the heavenly fields,
  Or walk the golden streets.

4 Then let our songs abound,
  And ev'ry tear be dry;
We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground
  To fairer worlds on high.

     Isaac Watts, 1709.


416     Work, for the Night is Coming. P.M.

_Work While it is Day._

Work, for the night is coming,
  Work thro' the morning hours;
Work while the dew is sparkling,
  Work 'mid springing flowers;
Work, when the day grows brighter,
  Work in the glowing sun;
Work, for the night is coming,
  When man's work is done.

2 Work, for the night is coming,
  Work thro' the sunny noon;
Fill brightest hours with labor,
  Rest comes sure and soon;
Give ev'ry flying minute,
  Something to keep in store;
Work, for the night is coming,
  When man works no more.

3 Work, for the night is coming,
  Under the sunset skies;
While their bright tints are glowing,
  Work, for daylight flies;
Work till the last beam fadeth,
  Fadeth to shine no more;
Work while the night is dark'ning,
  When man's work is o'er.

     Annie L. Walker.


417     Bringing in the Sheaves. P.M.

_Spiritual Harvest._

Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,
  Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve;
Waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping,
  We shall come, rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

Cho.--Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
      We shall come, rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves;
      Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
      We shall come, rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

2 Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,
  Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze;
By and by the harvest and the labor ended,
  We shall come, rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

3 Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master,
  Though the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;
When our weeping's over, he will bid us welcome;
  We shall come, rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

     Knowles Shaw.


418     Crown After Cross. P.M.

_Tears and Joy._

Light after darkness,
  Gain after loss,
Strength after weariness,
  Crown after cross,
Sweet after bitter,
  Song after sigh,
Home after wandering,
  Praise after cry.

Cho.--Now comes the weeping,
      Then the glad reaping;
      Now comes the labor hard,
      Then the reward.

2 Sheaves after sowing,
  Sun after rain,
Sight after mystery,
  Peace after pain,
Joy after sorrow,
  Calm after blast,
Rest after weariness,
  Sweet rest at last.

3 Near after distant,
  Gleam after gloom,
Love after loneliness,
  Life after tomb.
After long agony,
  Rapture of bliss;
Right was the pathway
  Leading to this.

     Frances R. Havergal.


419     I Love to Tell the Story. 7s. & 6s. D.

_The Old, Old Story._

I love to tell the story
  Of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and his glory,
  Of Jesus and his love!
I love to tell the story,
  Because I know it's true;
It satisfies my longings,
  As nothing else would do.

Cho.--I love to tell the story!
      'Twill be my theme in glory,
      To tell the old, old story
      Of Jesus and his love.

2 I love to tell the story!
  More wonderful it seems,
Than all the golden fancies
  Of all our golden dreams.
I love to tell the story!
  It did so much for me!
And that is just the reason,
  I tell it now to thee.

3 I love to tell the story!
  'Tis pleasant to repeat
What seems, each time, I tell it,
  More wonderfully sweet.
I love to tell the story!
  For some have never heard
The message of salvation
  From God's own Holy Word.

4 I love to tell the story!
  For those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting
  To hear it like the rest.
And when, in scenes of glory,
  I sing the new, new song,
'Twill be--the old, old story
  That I have loved so long.

     Miss Kate Hankey, 1867.


420     Only a Word. P.M.

_Speaking for Christ._

Only a word for Jesus,
  Spoken in fear with sense of need;
Yet, with the Master's blessing,
  Thousands that word may feed.

Cho.--Give me a word for thee, Master!
      Give me a word for thee!
      To speak thy praise,
      Some soul to raise,
      Oh, give me a word for thee.

2 Only a word for Jesus,
  Gentle and low with falt'ring breath;
Yet, with the Spirit's thrilling,
  Winning a soul from death.

3 Only a word for Jesus,
  Only a wav'ring soul to hear;
Yet, thro' increasing ages,
  Widen its help and cheer.

4 Only a word for Jesus,
  Feeble the love and praise appear:
Angels their songs are ceasing,
  Glad this new note to hear.

     E. S. Lorenz.


421     Is Your Lamp Still Burning? P.M.

_Waiting His Coming._

Are you Christ's light bearer?
Of his joy a sharer?
Is this dark world fairer
  For your cheering ray?
Is your beacon lighted,
Guiding souls benighted
  To the land of perfect day?

Cho.--Oh, brother, is your lamp trimmed and burning?
        Is the world made brighter by its cheering ray?
      Are you ever waiting
      For your Lord's returning?
        Are you watching day by day?

2 Is your heart warm glowing,
With his love o'erflowing,
And his goodness showing
  More and more each day?
Are you pressing onward,
With Christ's faithful vanguard,
  In the safe and narrow way?

3 Keep your altars burning,
Wait your Lord's returning,
While your heart's deep yearning
  Draws him ever near;
With his radiance splendid
Shall your light be blended
  When his glory shall appear?

     Priscilla J. Owens.


422     Will Jesus Find Us Watching? P.M.

_Faithfulness._

When Jesus comes to reward his servants,
  Whether it be noon or night,
Faithful to him will he find us watching,
  With our lamps all trimmed and bright?

Ref.--Oh, can we say we are ready, brother?
        Ready for the soul's bright home?
      Say, will he find you and me still watching,
        Waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?

2 If at the dawn of the early morning,
  He shall call us one by one,
When to the Lord we restore our talents,
  Will he answer thee--Well done?

3 Have we been true to the trust he left us?
  Do we seek to do our best?
If in our hearts there is naught condemns us,
  We shall have a glorious rest.

4 Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching,
  In his glory they shall share;
If he shall come at the dawn or midnight,
  Will he find us watching there?

     Fanny J. Crosby.


423     Laban. S.M.

_Watchfulness and Prayer._     (763)

My soul, be on thy guard,
  Ten thousand foes arise:
The hosts of sin are pressing hard
  To draw thee from the skies.

2 Oh, watch, and fight, and pray;
  The battle ne'er give o'er;
Renew it boldly every day,
  And help divine implore.

3 Ne'er think the vict'ry won
  Nor lay thine armor down;
Thy arduous work will not be done
  Till thou obtain thy crown.

4 Fight on, my soul, till death
  Shall bring thee to thy God;
He'll take thee, at thy parting breath,
  To his divine abode.

     George Heath, 1806.


424     Laban. S.M.

_The Panoply of God._     (761)

Soldiers of Christ! arise,
  And put your armor on,--
Strong, in the strength which God supplies,
  Through his eternal Son:--

2 Strong, in the Lord of hosts,
  And in his mighty power;
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts,
  Is more than conqueror.

3 Stand, then, in his great might,
  With all his strength endued;
And take, to arm you for the fight,
  The panoply of God:--

4 That, having all things done,
  And all your conflicts past,
You may o'ercome through Christ alone,
  And stand entire at last.

5 From strength to strength go on;
  Wrestle, and fight, and pray;
Tread all the powers of darkness down,
  And win the well-fought day.

6 Still let the Spirit cry,
  In all his soldiers, "Come,"
Till Christ, the Lord, descends from high,
  And takes the conquerors home.

     Charles Wesley, 1749.


425     Laban. S.M.

_Victory is on the Lord's Side._     (765)

Arise, ye saints, arise!
  The Lord our Leader is:
The foe before his banner flies,
  And victory is his.

2 We soon shall see the day
  When all our toils shall cease;
When we shall cast our arms away,
  And dwell in endless peace.

3 This hope supports us here;
