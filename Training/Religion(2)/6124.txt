commanded you.

2 Esdr 14:32
And forasmuch as he is a righteous judge, he took from you in
time the thing that he had given you.

2 Esdr 14:33
And now are ye here, and your brethren among you.

2 Esdr 14:34
Therefore if so be that ye will subdue your own
understanding, and reform your hearts, ye shall be kept alive
and after death ye shall obtain mercy.

2 Esdr 14:35
For after death shall the judgment come, when we shall live
again: and then shall the names of the righteous be manifest,
and the works of the ungodly shall be declared.

2 Esdr 14:36
Let no man therefore come unto me now, nor seek after me
these forty days.

2 Esdr 14:37
So I took the five men, as he commanded me, and we went into
the field, and remained there.

2 Esdr 14:38
And the next day, behold, a voice called me, saying, Esdras,
open thy mouth, and drink that I give thee to drink.

2 Esdr 14:39
Then opened I my mouth, and, behold, he reached me a full
cup, which was full as it were with water, but the colour of it
was like fire.

2 Esdr 14:40
And I took it, and drank: and when I had drunk of it, my
heart uttered understanding, and wisdom grew in my breast, for
my spirit strengthened my memory:

2 Esdr 14:41
And my mouth was opened, and shut no more.

2 Esdr 14:42
The Highest gave understanding unto the five men, and they
wrote the wonderful visions of the night that were told, which
they knew not: and they sat forty days, and they wrote in the
day, and at night they ate bread.

2 Esdr 14:43
As for me. I spake in the day, and I held not my tongue by
night.

2 Esdr 14:44
In forty days they wrote two hundred and four books.

2 Esdr 14:45
And it came to pass, when the forty days were filled, that
the Highest spake, saying, The first that thou hast written
publish openly, that the worthy and unworthy may read it:

2 Esdr 14:46
But keep the seventy last, that thou mayest deliver them only
to such as be wise among the people:

2 Esdr 14:47
For in them is the spring of understanding, the fountain of
wisdom, and the stream of knowledge.

2 Esdr 14:48
And I did so.

2 Esdr 15:1
Behold, speak thou in the ears of my people the words of
prophecy, which I will put in thy mouth, saith the Lord:

2 Esdr 15:2
And cause them to be written in paper: for they are faithful
and true.

2 Esdr 15:3
Fear not the imaginations against thee, let not the
incredulity of them trouble thee, that speak against thee.

2 Esdr 15:4
For all the unfaithful shall die in their unfaithfulness.

2 Esdr 15:5
Behold, saith the Lord, I will bring plagues upon the world;
the sword, famine, death, and destruction.

2 Esdr 15:6
For wickedness hath exceedingly polluted the whole earth, and
their hurtful works are fulfilled.

2 Esdr 15:7
Therefore saith the Lord,

2 Esdr 15:8
I will hold my tongue no more as touching their wickedness,
which they profanely commit, neither will I suffer them in those
things, in which they wickedly exercise themselves: behold, the
innocent and righteous blood crieth unto me, and the souls of
the just complain continually.

2 Esdr 15:9
And therefore, saith the Lord, I will surely avenge them, and
receive unto me all the innocent blood from among them.

2 Esdr 15:10
Behold, my people is led as a flock to the slaughter: I will
not suffer them now to dwell in the land of Egypt:

2 Esdr 15:11
But I will bring them with a mighty hand and a stretched out
arm, and smite Egypt with plagues, as before, and will destroy
all the land thereof.

2 Esdr 15:12
Egypt shall mourn, and the foundation of it shall be smitten
with the plague and punishment that God shall bring upon it.

2 Esdr 15:13
They that till the ground shall mourn: for their seeds shall
fail through the blasting and hail, and with a fearful
constellation.

2 Esdr 15:14
Woe to the world and them that dwell therein!

2 Esdr 15:15
For the sword and their destruction draweth nigh, and one
people shall stand up and fight against another, and swords in
their hands.

2 Esdr 15:16
For there shall be sedition among men, and invading one
another; they shall not regard their kings nor princes, and the
course of their actions shall stand in their power.

2 Esdr 15:17
A man shall desire to go into a city, and shall not be able.

2 Esdr 15:18
For because of their pride the cities shall be troubled, the
houses shall be destroyed, and men shall be afraid.

2 Esdr 15:19
A man shall have no pity upon his neighbour, but shall
destroy their houses with the sword, and spoil their goods,
because of the lack of bread, and for great tribulation.

2 Esdr 15:20
Behold, saith God, I will call together all the kings of the
earth to reverence me, which are from the rising of the sun,
from the south, from the east, and Libanus; to turn themselves
one against another, and repay the things that they have done to
them.

2 Esdr 15:21
Like as they do yet this day unto my chosen, so will I do
also, and recompense in their bosom. Thus saith the Lord God;

2 Esdr 15:22
My right hand shall not spare the sinners, and my sword shall
not cease over them that shed innocent blood upon the earth.

2 Esdr 15:23
The fire is gone forth from his wrath, and hath consumed the
foundations of the earth, and the sinners, like the straw that
is kindled.

2 Esdr 15:24
Woe to them that sin, and keep not my commandments! saith
the Lord.

2 Esdr 15:25
I will not spare them: go your way, ye children, from the
power, defile not my sanctuary.

2 Esdr 15:26
For the Lord knoweth all them that sin against him, and
therefore delivereth he them unto death and destruction.

2 Esdr 15:27
For now are the plagues come upon the whole earth and ye
shall remain in them: for God shall not deliver you, because ye
have sinned against him.

2 Esdr 15:28
Behold an horrible vision, and the appearance thereof from
the east:

2 Esdr 15:29
Where the nations of the dragons of Arabia shall come out
with many chariots, and the multitude of them shall be carried
as the wind upon earth, that all they which hear them may fear
and tremble.

2 Esdr 15:30
Also the Carmanians raging in wrath shall go forth as the
wild boars of the wood, and with great power shall they come,
and join battle with them, and shall waste a portion of the land
of the Assyrians.

2 Esdr 15:31
And then shall the dragons have the upper hand, remembering
their nature; and if they shall turn themselves, conspiring
together in great power to persecute them,

2 Esdr 15:32
Then these shall be troubled bled, and keep silence through
their power, and shall flee.

2 Esdr 15:33
And from the land of the Assyrians shall the enemy besiege
them, and consume some of them, and in their host shall be fear
and dread, and strife among their kings.

2 Esdr 15:34
Behold clouds from the east and from the north unto the
south, and they are very horrible to look upon, full of wrath
and storm.

2 Esdr 15:35
They shall smite one upon another, and they shall smite down
a great multitude of stars upon the earth, even their own star;
and blood shall be from the sword unto the belly,

2 Esdr 15:36
And dung of men unto the camel's hough.

2 Esdr 15:37
And there shall be great fearfulness and trembling upon
earth: and they that see the wrath shall be afraid, and
trembling shall come upon them.

2 Esdr 15:38
And then shall there come great storms from the south, and
from the north, and another part from the west.

2 Esdr 15:39
And strong winds shall arise from the east, and shall open
it; and the cloud which he raised up in wrath, and the star
stirred to cause fear toward the east and west wind, shall be
destroyed.

2 Esdr 15:40
The great and mighty clouds shall be puffed up full of wrath,
and the star, that they may make all the earth afraid, and them
that dwell therein; and they shall pour out over every high and
eminent place an horrible star,

2 Esdr 15:41
Fire, and hail, and flying swords, and many waters, that all
fields may be full, and all rivers, with the abundance of great
waters.

2 Esdr 15:42
And they shall break down the cities and walls, mountains and
hills, trees of the wood, and grass of the meadows, and their
corn.

2 Esdr 15:43
And they shall go stedfastly unto Babylon, and make her
afraid.

2 Esdr 15:44
They shall come to her, and besiege her, the star and all
wrath shall they pour out upon her: then shall the dust and
smoke go up unto the heaven, and all they that be about her
shall bewail her.

2 Esdr 15:45
And they that remain under her shall do service unto them
that have put her in fear.

2 Esdr 15:46
And thou, Asia, that art partaker of the hope of Babylon, and
art the glory of her person:

2 Esdr 15:47
Woe be unto thee, thou wretch, because thou hast made thyself
like unto her; and hast decked thy daughters in whoredom, that
they might please and glory in thy lovers, which have always
desired to commit whoredom with thee.

2 Esdr 15:48
Thou hast followed her that is hated in all her works and
inventions: therefore saith God,

2 Esdr 15:49
I will send plagues upon thee; widowhood, poverty, famine,
sword, and pestilence, to waste thy houses with destruction and
death.

2 Esdr 15:50
And the glory of thy Power shall be dried up as a flower, the
heat shall arise that is sent over thee.

2 Esdr 15:51
Thou shalt be weakened as a poor woman with stripes, and as
one chastised with wounds, so that the mighty and lovers shall
not be able to receive thee.

2 Esdr 15:52
Would I with jealousy have so proceeded against thee, saith
the Lord,

2 Esdr 15:53
If thou hadst not always slain my chosen, exalting the stroke
of thine hands, and saying over their dead, when thou wast
drunken,

2 Esdr 15:54
Set forth the beauty of thy countenance?

2 Esdr 15:55
The reward of thy whoredom shall be in thy bosom, therefore
shalt thou receive recompence.

2 Esdr 15:56
Like as thou hast done unto my chosen, saith the Lord, even
so shall God do unto thee, and shall deliver thee into mischief

2 Esdr 15:57
Thy children shall die of hunger, and thou shalt fall through
the sword: thy cities shall be broken down, and all thine shall
perish with the sword in the field.

2 Esdr 15:58
They that be in the mountains shall die of hunger, and eat
their own flesh, and drink their own blood, for very hunger of
bread, and thirst of water.

2 Esdr 15:59
Thou as unhappy shalt come through the sea, and receive
plagues again.

2 Esdr 15:60
And in the passage they shall rush on the idle city, and
shall destroy some portion of thy land, and consume part of thy
glory, and shall return to Babylon that was destroyed.

2 Esdr 15:61
And thou shalt be cast down by them as stubble, and they
shall be unto thee as fire;

2 Esdr 15:62
And shall consume thee, and thy cities, thy land, and thy
mountains; all thy woods and thy fruitful trees shall they burn
up with fire.

2 Esdr 15:63
Thy children shall they carry away captive, and, look, what
thou hast, they shall spoil it, and mar the beauty of thy face.

2 Esdr 16:1
Woe be unto thee, Babylon, and Asia! woe be unto thee, Egypt
and Syria!

2 Esdr 16:2
Gird up yourselves with cloths of sack and hair, bewail your
children, and be sorry; for your destruction is at hand.

2 Esdr 16:3
A sword is sent upon you, and who may turn it back?

2 Esdr 16:4
A fire is sent among you, and who may quench it?

2 Esdr 16:5
Plagues are sent unto you, and what is he that may drive them
away?

2 Esdr 16:6
May any man drive away an hungry lion in the wood? or may any
one quench the fire in stubble, when it hath begun to burn?

2 Esdr 16:7
May one turn again the arrow that is shot of a strong archer?

2 Esdr 16:8
The mighty Lord sendeth the plagues and who is he that can
drive them away?

2 Esdr 16:9
A fire shall go forth from his wrath, and who is he that may
quench it?

2 Esdr 16:10
He shall cast lightnings, and who shall not fear? he shall
thunder, and who shall not be afraid?

2 Esdr 16:11
The Lord shall threaten, and who shall not be utterly beaten
to powder at his presence?

2 Esdr 16:12
The earth quaketh, and the foundations thereof; the sea
ariseth up with waves from the deep, and the waves of it are
troubled, and the fishes thereof also, before the Lord, and
before the glory of his power:

2 Esdr 16:13
For strong is his right hand that bendeth the bow, his arrows
that he shooteth are sharp, and shall not miss, when they begin
to be shot into the ends of the world.

2 Esdr 16:14
Behold, the plagues are sent, and shall not return again,
until they come upon the earth.

2 Esdr 16:15
The fire is kindled, and shall not be put out, till it
consume the foundation of the earth.

2 Esdr 16:16
Like as an arrow which is shot of a mighty archer returneth
not backward: even so the plagues that shall be sent upon earth
shall not return again.

2 Esdr 16:17
Woe is me! woe is me! who will deliver me in those days?

2 Esdr 16:18
The beginning of sorrows and great mournings; the beginning
of famine and great death; the beginning of wars, and the powers
shall stand in fear; the beginning of evils! what shall I do
when these evils shall come?

2 Esdr 16:19
Behold, famine and plague, tribulation and anguish, are sent
as scourges for amendment.

2 Esdr 16:20
But for all these things they shall not turn from their
wickedness, nor be always mindful of the scourges.

2 Esdr 16:21
Behold, victuals shall be so good cheap upon earth, that they
shall think themselves to be in good case, and even then shall
evils grow upon earth, sword, famine, and great confusion.

2 Esdr 16:22
For many of them that dwell upon earth shall perish of
famine; and the other, that escape the hunger, shall the sword
destroy.

2 Esdr 16:23
And the dead shall be cast out as dung, and there shall be no
man to comfort them: for the earth shall be wasted, and the
cities shall be cast down.

2 Esdr 16:24
There shall be no man left to till the earth, and to sow it

2 Esdr 16:25
The trees shall give fruit, and who shall gather them?

2 Esdr 16:26
The grapes shall ripen, and who shall tread them? for all
places shall be desolate of men:

2 Esdr 16:27
So that one man shall desire to see another, and to hear his
voice.

2 Esdr 16:28
For of a city there shall be ten left, and two of the field,
which shall hide themselves in the thick groves, and in the
clefts of the rocks.

2 Esdr 16:29
As in an orchard of Olives upon every tree there are left
three or four olives;

2 Esdr 16:30
Or as when a vineyard is gathered, there are left some
clusters of them that diligently seek through the vineyard:

2 Esdr 16:31
Even so in those days there shall be three or four left by
them that search their houses with the sword.

2 Esdr 16:32
And the earth shall be laid waste, and the fields thereof
shall wax old, and her ways and all her paths shall grow full of
thorns, because no man shall travel therethrough.

2 Esdr 16:33
The virgins shall mourn, having no bridegrooms; the women
shall mourn, having no husbands; their daughters shall mourn,
having no helpers.

2 Esdr 16:34
In the wars shall their bridegrooms be destroyed, and their
husbands shall perish of famine.

2 Esdr 16:35
Hear now these things and understand them, ye servants of the
Lord.

2 Esdr 16:36
Behold, the word of the Lord, receive it: believe not the
gods of whom the Lord spake.

2 Esdr 16:37
Behold, the plagues draw nigh, and are not slack.

2 Esdr 16:38
As when a woman with child in the ninth month bringeth forth
her son, with two or three hours of her birth great pains
compass her womb, which pains, when the child cometh forth, they
slack not a moment:

2 Esdr 16:39
Even so shall not the plagues be slack to come upon the
earth, and the world shall mourn, and sorrows shall come upon it
on every side.

2 Esdr 16:40
O my people, hear my word: make you ready to thy battle, and
in those evils be even as pilgrims upon the earth.

2 Esdr 16:41
He that selleth, let him be as he that fleeth away: and he
that buyeth, as one that will lose:

2 Esdr 16:42
He that occupieth merchandise, as he that hath no profit by
it: and he that buildeth, as he that shall not dwell therein:

2 Esdr 16:43
He that soweth, as if he should not reap: so also he that
planteth the vineyard, as he that shall not gather the grapes:

2 Esdr 16:44
They that marry, as they that shall get no children; and they
that marry not, as the widowers.

2 Esdr 16:45
And therefore they that labour labour in vain:

2 Esdr 16:46
For strangers shall reap their fruits, and spoil their goods,
overthrow their houses, and take their children captives, for in
captivity and famine shall they get children.

2 Esdr 16:47
And they that occupy their merchandise with robbery, the more
they deck their cities, their houses, their possessions, and
their own persons:

2 Esdr 16:48
The more will I be angry with them for their sin, saith the
Lord.

2 Esdr 16:49
Like as a whore envieth a right honest and virtuous woman:

2 Esdr 16:50
So shall righteousness hate iniquity, when she decketh
herself, and shall accuse her to her face, when he cometh that
shall defend him that diligently searcheth out every sin upon
earth.

2 Esdr 16:51
And therefore be ye not like thereunto, nor to the works
thereof.

2 Esdr 16:52
For yet a little, and iniquity shall be taken away out of the
earth, and righteousness shall reign among you.

2 Esdr 16:53
Let not the sinner say that he hath not sinned: for God shall
burn coals of fire upon his head, which saith before the Lord
God and his glory, I have not sinned.

2 Esdr 16:54
Behold, the Lord knoweth all the works of men, their
imaginations, their thoughts, and their hearts:

2 Esdr 16:55
Which spake but the word, Let the earth be made; and it was
made: Let the heaven be made; and it was created.

2 Esdr 16:56
In his word were the stars made, and he knoweth the number of
them.

2 Esdr 16:57
He searcheth the deep, and the treasures thereof; he hath
measured the sea, and what it containeth.

2 Esdr 16:58
He hath shut the sea in the midst of the waters, and with his
word hath he hanged the earth upon the waters.

2 Esdr 16:59
He spreadeth out the heavens like a vault; upon the waters
hath he founded it.

2 Esdr 16:60
In the desert hath he made springs of water, and pools upon
the tops of the mountains, that the floods might pour down from
the high rocks to water the earth.

2 Esdr 16:61
He made man, and put his heart in the midst of the body, and
gave him breath, life, and understanding.

2 Esdr 16:62
Yea and the Spirit of Almighty God, which made all things,
and searcheth out all hidden things in the secrets of the earth,

2 Esdr 16:63
Surely he knoweth your inventions, and what ye think in your
hearts, even them that sin, and would hide their sin.

2 Esdr 16:64
Therefore hath the Lord exactly searched out all your works,
and he will put you all to shame.

2 Esdr 16:65
And when your sins are brought forth, ye shall be ashamed
before men, and your own sins shall be your accusers in that
day.

2 Esdr 16:66
What will ye do? or how will ye hide your sins before God and
his angels?

2 Esdr 16:67
Behold, God himself is the judge, fear him: leave off from
your sins, and forget your iniquities, to meddle no more with
them for ever: so shall God lead you forth, and deliver you from
all trouble.

2 Esdr 16:68
For, behold, the burning wrath of a great multitude is
kindled over you, and they shall take away certain of you, and
feed you, being idle, with things offered unto idols.

2 Esdr 16:69
And they that consent unto them shall be had in derision and
in reproach, and trodden under foot.

2 Esdr 16:70
For there shall be in every place, and in the next cities, a
great insurrection upon those that fear the Lord.

2 Esdr 16:71
They shall be like mad men, sparing none, but still spoiling
and destroying those that fear the Lord.

2 Esdr 16:72
For they shall waste and take away their goods, and cast them
out of their houses.

2 Esdr 16:73
Then shall they be known, who are my chosen; and they shall
be tried as the gold in the fire.

2 Esdr 16:74
Hear, O ye my beloved, saith the Lord: behold, the days of
trouble are at hand, but I will deliver you from the same.

2 Esdr 16:75
Be ye not afraid neither doubt; for God is your guide,

2 Esdr 16:76
And the guide of them who keep my commandments and precepts,
saith the Lord God: let not your sins weigh you down, and let
not your iniquities lift up themselves.

2 Esdr 16:77
Woe be unto them that are bound with their sins, and covered
with their iniquities like as a field is covered over with
bushes, and the path thereof covered with thorns, that no man
may travel through!

2 Esdr 16:78
It is left undressed, and is cast into the fire to be
consumed therewith.




The Greek Additions to Esther
[The Rest of the Chapters of the Book of Esther]



AddEsth 10:4
Then Mardocheus said, God hath done these things.

AddEsth 10:5
For I remember a dream which I saw concerning these matters,
and nothing thereof hath failed.

AddEsth 10:6
A little fountain became a river, and there was light, and the
sun, and much water: this river is Esther, whom the king
married, and made queen:

AddEsth 10:7
And the two dragons are I and Aman.

AddEsth 10:8
And the nations were those that were assembled to destroy the
name of the Jews:

AddEsth 10:9
And my nation is this Israel, which cried to God, and were
saved: for the Lord hath saved his people, and the Lord hath
delivered us from all those evils, and God hath wrought signs
and great wonders, which have not been done among the Gentiles.

AddEsth 10:10
Therefore hath he made two lots, one for the people of God,
and another for all the Gentiles.

AddEsth 10:11
And these two lots came at the hour, and time, and day of
judgment, before God among all nations.

AddEsth 10:12
So God remembered his people, and justified his inheritance.

AddEsth 10:13
Therefore those days shall be unto them in the month Adar,
the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the same month, with an
assembly, and joy, and with gladness before God, according to
the generations for ever among his people.

AddEsth 11:1
In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemeus and Cleopatra,
Dositheus, who said he was a priest and Levite, and Ptolemeus
his son, brought this epistle of Phurim, which they said was the
same, and that Lysimachus the son of Ptolemeus, that was in
Jerusalem, had interpreted it.

AddEsth 11:2
In the second year of the reign of Artexerxes the great, in
the first day of the month Nisan, Mardocheus the son of Jairus,
the son of Semei, the son of Cisai, of the tribe of Benjamin,
had a dream;

AddEsth 11:3
Who was a Jew, and dwelt in the city of Susa, a great man,
being a servitor in the king's court.

AddEsth 11:4
He was also one of the captives, which Nabuchodonosor the
king of Babylon carried from Jerusalem with Jechonias king of
Judea; and this was his dream:

AddEsth 11:5
Behold a noise of a tumult, with thunder, and earthquakes,
and uproar in the land:

AddEsth 11:6
And, behold, two great dragons came forth ready to fight, and
their cry was great.

AddEsth 11:7
And at their cry all nations were prepared to battle, that
they might fight against the righteous people.

AddEsth 11:8
And lo a day of darkness and obscurity, tribulation and
anguish, affliction and great uproar, upon earth.

AddEsth 11:9
And the whole righteous nation was troubled, fearing their
own evils, and were ready to perish.

AddEsth 11:10
Then they cried unto God, and upon their cry, as it were from
a little fountain, was made a great flood, even much water.

AddEsth 11:11
The light and the sun rose up, and the lowly were exalted,
and devoured the glorious.

AddEsth 11:12
Now when Mardocheus, who had seen this dream, and what God
had determined to do, was awake, he bare this dream in mind, and
until night by all means was desirous to know it.

AddEsth 12:1
And Mardocheus took his rest in the court with Gabatha and
Tharra, the two eunuchs of the king, and keepers of the palace.

AddEsth 12:2
And he heard their devices, and searched out their purposes,
and learned that they were about to lay hands upon Artexerxes
the king; and so he certified the king of them.

AddEsth 12:3
Then the king examined the two eunuchs, and after that they
had confessed it, they were strangled.

AddEsth 12:4
And the king made a record of these things, and Mardocheus
also wrote thereof.

AddEsth 12:5
So the king commanded, Mardocheus to serve in the court, and
for this he rewarded him.

AddEsth 12:6
Howbeit Aman the son of Amadathus the Agagite, who was in
great honour with the king, sought to molest Mardocheus and his
people because of the two eunuchs of the king.

AddEsth 13:1
The copy of the letters was this: The great king Artexerxes
writeth these things to the princes and governours that are under
him from India unto Ethiopia in an hundred and seven and twenty
provinces.

AddEsth 13:2
After that I became lord over many nations and had dominion
over the whole world, not lifted up with presumption of my
authority, but carrying myself always with equity and mildness,
I purposed to settle my subjects continually in a quiet life,
and making my kingdom peaceable, and open for passage to the
utmost coasts, to renew peace, which is desired of all men.

AddEsth 13:3
Now when I asked my counsellors how this might be brought to
pass, Aman, that excelled in wisdom among us, and was approved
for his constant good will and steadfast fidelity, and had the
honour of the second place in the kingdom,

AddEsth 13:4
Declared unto us, that in all nations throughout the world
there was scattered a certain malicious people, that had laws
contrary to ail nations, and continually despised the
commandments of kings, so as the uniting of our kingdoms,
honourably intended by us cannot go forward.

AddEsth 13:5
Seeing then we understand that this people alone is
continually in opposition unto all men, differing in the strange
manner of their laws, and evil affected to our state, working
all the mischief they can that our kingdom may not be firmly
established:

AddEsth 13:6
Therefore have we commanded, that all they that are signified
in writing unto you by Aman, who is ordained over the affairs,
and is next unto us, shall all, with their wives and children,
be utterly destroyed by the sword of their enemies, without all
mercy and pity, the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar of
this present year:

AddEsth 13:7
That they, who of old and now also are malicious, may in one
day with violence go into the grave, and so ever hereafter cause
our affairs to be well settled, and without trouble.

AddEsth 13:8
Then Mardocheus thought upon all the works of the Lord, and
made his prayer unto him,

AddEsth 13:9
Saying, O Lord, Lord, the King Almighty: for the whole world
is in thy power, and if thou hast appointed to save Israel,
there is no man that can gainsay thee:

AddEsth 13:10
For thou hast made heaven and earth, and all the wondrous
things under the heaven.

AddEsth 13:11
Thou art Lord of all things, and and there is no man that can
resist thee, which art the Lord.

AddEsth 13:12
Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest, Lord, that it was
neither in contempt nor pride, nor for any desire of glory, that
I did not bow down to proud Aman.

AddEsth 13:13
For I could have been content with good will for the
salvation of Israel to kiss the soles of his feet.

AddEsth 13:14
But I did this, that I might not prefer the glory of man
above the glory of God: neither will I worship any but thee, O
God, neither will I do it in pride.

AddEsth 13:15
And now, O Lord God and King, spare thy people: for their
