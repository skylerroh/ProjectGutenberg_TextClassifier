PREFACE


_The poems garnered up in this little volume were written at different
periods in the life of the author, dating from her early girlhood up to
recent years. They were not written with a view of making a book, each
poem being the spontaneous outpouring of a deeply poetic nature and
called forth by some experience that claimed her attention._

_The "Old Man of the Mountain," for instance, was written while the
author was contemplating this lofty New Hampshire crag, whose rugged
outlines resemble the profile of a human face. Inspired by the grandeur
of this masterpiece of nature's handiwork, and looking "up through
nature, unto nature's God," the poem began to take form in her thought,
and alighting from her carriage, she seated herself by the roadside and
began to write. Some tourists who were passing, and who made her
acquaintance, asked her what she was writing, and she replied by reading
the poem to them. They were so pleased with it that each requested a
copy, which was subsequently mailed to them. Similar requests continued
to reach the author for years afterward, until the poem finally found
its way into print, appearing, together with "The Valley Cemetery," in a
book "Gems for You," published in Manchester, N. H., in 1850, and again
in Boston, in 1856._

_The poem on the "Dedication of a Temperance Hall," in Lynn, Mass., in
1866, was written for that occasion, and was sung by the audience as a
dedicatory hymn. "The Liberty Bells" appeared in a Lynn, Mass.,
newspaper, under the date of February 3, 1865. A note from the author,
which was published with the poem, read as follows:_

"MR. EDITOR:--_In 1835 a mob in Boston (although Boston has since been
the pioneer of anti-slavery) dispersed a meeting of the Female
Anti-Slavery Society, and assailed the person of William Lloyd Garrison
with such fury that the city authorities could protect him nowhere but
in the walls of a jail. To-day, by order of Governor Andrew, the bells
are ringing to celebrate the passing of a resolution in Congress
prohibiting slavery in the United States."_

_All of the author's best-known hymns are included in this collection,
as well as many poems written in girlhood and during the years she
resided in Lynn, Mass., and which appeared in various publications of
that day. Among her earliest poems are "Upward," "Resolutions for the
Day," "Autumn" (written in a maple grove), "Alphabet and Bayonet," and
"The Country-Seat" (written while visiting a family friend in the
beautiful suburbs of Boston); yet, even these are characterized by the
same lofty trend of thought that reached its fulness in her later
productions._

_In May, 1910, Mrs. Eddy requested her publisher to prepare a few bound
volumes of her poems, for private distribution. When this became known
to her friends, they urged her to allow a popular edition to be issued,
to which she assented. With grateful acknowledgment, therefore, of this
permission, this little volume is presented to the public, in the hope
that these gems of purest thought from this spiritually-minded author
will prove a joy to the heavy laden and a balm to the weary heart._

POEMS




_OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN_


    Gigantic sire, unfallen still thy crest!
    Primeval dweller where the wild winds rest,
    Beyond the ken of mortal e'er to tell
    What power sustains thee in thy rock-bound cell.

    Or if, when first creation vast began,
    And far the universal fiat ran,
    "Let there be light"--from chaos dark set free,
    Ye rose, a monument of Deity,

    Proud from yon cloud-crowned height to look henceforth
    On insignificance that peoples earth,
    Recalling oft the bitter draft which turns
    The mind to meditate on what it learns.

    Stern, passionless, no soul those looks betray;
    Though kindred rocks, to sport at mortal clay--
    Much as the chisel of the sculptor's art
    "Plays round the head, but comes not to the heart."

    Ah, who can fathom thee! Ambitious man,
    Like a trained falcon in the Gallic van,
    Guided and led, can never reach to thee
    With all the strength of weakness--vanity!

    Great as thou art, and paralleled by none,
    Admired by all, still art thou drear and lone!
    The moon looks down upon thine exiled height;
    The stars, so cold, so glitteringly bright,

    On wings of morning gladly flit away,
    Yield to the sun's more genial, mighty ray;
    The white waves kiss the murmuring rill--
    But thy deep silence is unbroken still.
