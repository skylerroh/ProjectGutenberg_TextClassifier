    And our Lord, His love unfolding,
      Made the earth His dwelling-place;
    And a virgin mother gave
    God Incarnate, man to save.

                                   IV

    Wisdom, Might, and Word Eternal,
      Glory of the Father, Thou!
    Hid from man and powers supernal,
      Lo, He wears our nature now!
    To the Lord your worship bring,
    Praise Him, your victorious King.

                                    I

    What shall we bring to Thee?
    What shall our offering be
      On this Thy natal morn?
    For Thou, O Christ, hast come to earth--
    A virgin mother gave Thee birth--
      For our redemption born.

                                   II

    The whole creation broad
    Gives praise and thanks to God,
      Who gave His only Son;
    And list! the bright angelic throng
    Their homage yield in sweetest song
      For peace on earth begun.

                                   III

    The heavens their glory shed,
    The star shines o'er His head,
      The promised Christ and King;
    And wise men from the lands afar,
    Led by the brightness of the star,
      Their treasured offerings bring.

                                   IV

    What shall we give Thee now?
    Lowly the shepherds bow,
      Have we no gift to bring?
    Our worship, lo, we yield to Thee,
    All that we are, and hope to be--
      This is our offering.

    In the bliss of old predicted,
      Heaven and earth to-day rejoice;
    Men and angels, one in spirit,
      Shout aloud in gleeful voice;
    For, to those in darkness drear,
    God in human flesh is near.

                                   II

    Cave and manger show the mystery;
      Shepherds tell the wondrous tale;
    Bearing gifts to lay before Him
      From the East the Magi hail;
    Taught by angel words to sing,
    We unworthy praises bring.

                                   III

    Glory be to God eternal!
      Peace on earth its reign begin!
    For the one Desire of nations
      Comes to save us from our sin;
    Freedom He will now bestow
    From the bondage of the foe.

    Bethlehem rejoices,
      Hark the voices clear,
    Singing in the starlight
      Nearer and more near.
            Unto God be glory,
              Peace to men be given,
            This His will who dwelleth

    Heaven can not contain Him,
      Nor the bounds of earth,
    Yet, O Glorious Mystery!
      Virgin gives Him birth.
            Unto God be glory,
              Peace to men be given,
            This His will who dwelleth

    Now the light ariseth
      In the darkened skies,
    Now the proud are humbled
      And the lowly rise.
            Unto God be glory,
              Peace to men be given,
            This His will who dwelleth
              In the heights of heaven.

    To-day the groans of Hades rise,--
      'Ah, better far for me
    The Son of Man had never died
      Upon the cursed tree!
    For by His power the fettered souls
      I held in darkest night,
    Are carried through the sundered gates
      Into the realm of light.'
          Let glory now the Cross adorn,
          Hail, hail the Resurrection morn!

    To-day the groans of Hades rise,--
      'My might is overthrown;
    I took One dead, from 'mong the dead,
      And claimed Him for mine own;
    But He hath crushed my ancient power;
      And those I held in thrall
    Have thrown aside the chains they wore,
      And He hath rescued all.'
          Let glory now the Cross adorn,
          Hail, hail the Resurrection morn!

    To-day the groans of Hades rise,--
      'My power is gone from me;
    The Shepherd died upon the Cross,
      And Adam's sons are free;
    The bars are taken from the tomb,
      Death can no more appal;
    For He who gave Himself to death,
      By death hath rescued all.'
          Let glory now the Cross adorn,
          Hail, hail the Resurrection morn!

    No longer now at Eden's gate
      The fiery weapon gleams,
    But from the Cross that leads to life
      A light alluring streams.

                                   II

    And now the power of Death is gone,
      His sting is torn away;
    Grim Hades can no longer claim
      His silent victory.

                                   III

    For Thou, O Saviour, didst descend
      Where darkness brooding lies,
    And bad'st the souls in bondage held
      Return to Paradise.

    Thou one Begotten Son,

    Immortal while the ages run,
      And our Almighty Lord;

    To bring Salvation nigh,
      To vanquish death and sin,
    Thou didst in cruel anguish die,
      And life for mortals win.

                                   III

    Save us, O Christ our God,
      Save by Thy Cross, we pray;
    Thou who didst bear the Father's rod,
      And death by dying slay.

                                   IV

    Thou art the Eternal Son,
      One in the glorious Three;
    Co-equal praise while ages run
      Shall ever rise to thee.

    When on the cruel Cross
      The Lord was lifted high,
    Affrighted earth in terror quailed
      To see its Maker die.

                                   II

    Then had the yawning caves
      Devoured the murderous band,
    Had not the Crucified in love
      Stretched forth His saving hand.

    Thou gav'st Thyself to die,
      Dark Hades to explore,
    To bring to souls in prison bound
      New life for evermore.
