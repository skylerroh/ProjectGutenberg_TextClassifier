    Thy favor still has crowned our days,
    And we would celebrate thy praise.

2   The harvest song we would repeat;
    "Thou givest us the finest wheat;"
    "The joy of harvest" we have known;
    The praise, O Lord! is all thine own.

3   Our tables spread, our garners stored,
    O give us hearts to bless thee, Lord!
    Forbid it, Source of light and love,
    That hearts and lives should barren prove.

4   Another harvest comes apace;
    Ripen our spirits by thy grace,
    That we may calmly meet the blow
    The sickle gives to lay us low.

5   That so, when angel reapers come
    To gather sheaves to thy blest home,
    Our spirits may be borne on high
    To thy safe garner in the sky.

Harvest Home.


1   The last full wain has come,--has come!
    And brought the golden harvest home:
    The labors of the year are done:
    Accept our thanks, all-bounteous One!

2   For the green spring, her herbs and flowers,
    For the warm summer's blooming bowers,
    For all the fruits that flush the boughs,
    When russet autumn decks her brows;

3   For the bright sun, whose fervid ray
    Ripens the corn, and cheers the day;
    For the round moon, whose yellow light
    Gilds the long labors of the night;

4   For the rich sea of shining grain,
    That spreads its waves o'er hill and plain,
    For the cool breeze, whose light wings fan
    The weary, sun-burnt husbandman;

5   For the soft herbage of the soil,
    For ruddy health, the child of toil;
    For all the good the year displays,
    Accept, O God, our grateful praise.

1   Lord of heaven, and earth, and ocean,
      Hear us from thy bright abode,
    While our hearts, with true devotion,
      Own their great and gracious God.

2   Health and every needful blessing
      Are thy bounteous gifts alone;
    Comforts undeserved possessing,
      Here we bend before thy throne.

3   Thee, with humble adoration,
      Lord, we praise for mercies past;
    Still to this most favored nation
      May those mercies ever last.

Thanksgiving.


1   Swell the anthem, raise the song;
    Praises to our God belong;
    Saints and angels, join to sing
    Praises to the Heavenly King.

2   Blessings from his liberal hand
    Flow around this happy land:
    Kept by him, no foes annoy;
    Peace and freedom we enjoy.

3   Here, beneath a virtuous sway,
    May we cheerfully obey,--
    Never feel oppression's rod,--
    Ever own and worship God.

4   Hark! the voice of nature sings
    Praises to the King of kings;
    Let us join the choral song,
    And the grateful notes prolong.

    Daily, O Jehovah! waits;
    Unto thee, O God! belong
    Grateful words and holy song.

2   Thou the hope and refuge art
    Of remotest lands apart,
    Distant isles and tribes unknown,
    'Mid the ocean-waste, and lone.

3   Thou dost visit earth, and rain
    Blessings on the thirsty plain,
    From the copious founts on high,
    From the rivers of the sky.

4   Thus the clouds thy power confess,
    And thy paths drop fruitfulness:
    And the voice of song and mirth
    Rises from the tribes of earth.

2   Seasons and times obey his voice;
    The evening and the morn rejoice
    To see the earth made soft with showers,
    Enriched with fruit, and dressed in flowers.

3   Thy works pronounce thy power divine;
    In all the earth thy glories shine;
    Through every month thy gifts appear;
    Great God, thy goodness crowns the year.

Harvest.


1   God of the year! with songs of praise
    And hearts of love, we come to bless
    Thy bounteous hand, for thou hast shed
    Thy manna o'er our wilderness.

2   In early spring-time thou didst fling
    O'er earth its robe of blossoming;
    And its sweet treasures, day by day,
    Rose quickening in thy blessed ray.

3   God of the seasons! thou hast blest
    The land with sunlight and with showers,
    And plenty o'er its bosom smiles
    To crown the sweet autumnal hours.

4   Praise,--praise to thee! Our hearts expand
    To view these blessings of thy hand,
    And on the incense-breath of love
    Ascend to their bright home above.

Thanksgiving for National Prosperity.


1   How rich thy gifts, Almighty King!
    From thee our public blessings spring;
      Th' extended trade, the fruitful skies,
    The treasures liberty bestows,
    Th' eternal joys the gospel shows,--
      All from thy boundless goodness rise.

2   Here commerce spreads the wealthy store,
    Which pours from every foreign shore;
      Science and art their charms display;
    Religion teaches us to raise
    Our voices to our Maker's praise,
      As truth and conscience point the way.

3   With grateful hearts, with joyful tongues,
    To God we raise united songs;
      His power and mercy we proclaim;
    This land through every age shall own,
    Jehovah here has fixed his throne,
      And triumph in his mighty name.

4   Long as the moon her course shall run,
    Or man behold the circling sun,
      O, still may God amidst us reign;
    Crown our just counsels with success,
    With peace and joy our borders bless,
      And all our sacred rights maintain.

    By which, supported still, we stand:
    The opening year thy mercy shows;
    Let mercy crown it till it close.

2   By day, by night, at home, abroad,
    Still we are guarded by our God;
    By his incessant bounty fed,
    By his unerring counsel led.

3   With grateful hearts the past we own:
    The future, all to us unknown,
    We to thy guardian care commit,
    And peaceful leave before thy feet,

4   In scenes exalted or depressed,
    Be thou our joy, and thou our rest:
    Thy goodness all our hopes shall raise,
    Adored through all our changing days.

5   When death shall interrupt these songs,
    And seal in silence mortal tongues,
    Our Helper, God, in whom we trust,
    In better worlds our souls shall boast.

Reflections for a New Year.


1   Remark, my soul, the narrow bounds
      Of the revolving year;
    How swift the weeks complete their rounds!
      How short the months appear!

2   Yet like an idle tale we pass
      The swift advancing year;
    And study artful ways t' increase
      The speed of its career.

3   Waken, O God, my trifling heart,
      Its great concerns to see;
    That I may act the Christian part,
      And give the year to thee.

4   Thus shall their course more grateful roll,
      If future years arise;
    Or this shall bear my peaceful soul
      To joy that never dies.

New Year's Day.


1   While, with ceaseless course, the sun
      Hasted through the former year,
    Many souls their race have run,
      Never more to meet us here:
    Fixed in an eternal state,
      They have done with all below:
    We a little longer wait,
      But how little none can know.

2   As the winged arrow flies,
      Speedily the mark to find;
    As the lightning from the skies
      Darts and leaves no trace behind;--
    Swiftly thus our fleeting days
      Bear us down life's rapid stream:
    Upward, Lord, our spirits raise;
      All below is but a dream.

3   Thanks for mercies past receive;
      Pardon of our sins renew;
    Teach us, henceforth, how to live,
      With eternity in view;
    Bless thy word to old and young;
      Fill us with a Saviour's love;
    When our life's short race is run,
      May we dwell with thee above.

The Same.


1   My helper, God, I bless his name;
    The same his power, his grace the same;
    The tokens of his friendly care
    Open, and crown, and close, the year.

2   I 'midst ten thousand dangers stand,
    Supported by his guardian hand,
    And see, when I survey my ways,
    Ten thousand monuments of praise.

3   Thus far his arm hath led me on;
    Thus far I make his mercy known;
    And, while I tread this mortal land,
    New mercies shall new songs demand.

1   God of our lives, thy various praise
      Our voices shall resound:
    Thy hand directs our fleeting days,
      And brings the seasons round.

2   To thee shall grateful songs arise,
      Our Father and our Friend,
    Whose constant mercies from the skies
      In genial streams descend.

3   In every scene of life, thy care,
      In every age, we see;
    And constant as thy favors are,
      So let our praises be.

4   Still may thy love, in every scene,
      In every age, appear;
    And let the same compassion deign
      To bless the opening year.

5   If mercy smile, let mercy bring
      Our wandering souls to God:
    In our affliction we shall sing,
      If thou wilt bless the rod.

    Crown with thy smile the present year;
    Preserve me by thy favor still,
    And fit me for thy sacred will.

2   My safety, each succeeding hour,
    Depends on thy supporting power:
    Accept my thanks for mercies past,
    And be my guard, while life shall last.

3   My moments move with winged haste,
    Nor know I which shall be the last:
    Danger and death are ever nigh,
    And I this year perhaps may die.

4   Prepare me for the trying day;
    Then call my willing soul away:
    I'll quit the world at thy command,
    And trust my spirit to thy hand.

      And soften hearts of stone.

2   From all the guilt of former sin
      May mercy set us free;
    And let the year we now begin,
      Begin and end with thee.

3   Send down thy spirit from above,
      That saints may love thee more,
    And sinners now may learn to love,
      Who never loved before.

4   And when before thee we appear,
      In our eternal home,
    May growing numbers worship here,
      And praise thee in our room.

Self-Examination. New Year.


1   As o'er the past my memory strays,
      Why heaves the secret sigh?
    'Tis that I mourn departed days,
      Still unprepared to die.

2   The world, and worldly things beloved,
      My anxious thoughts employed;
    And time unhallowed, unimproved,
      Presents a fearful void.

3   Yet, Holy Father! wild despair
      Chase from my laboring breast;
    Thy grace it is which prompts the prayer.
      That grace can do the rest.

4   My life's brief remnant all be thine;
      And when thy sure decree
    Bids me this fleeting breath resign,
      O speed my soul to thee!

    To the souls assembling here:
    Clothe thy word with power divine,
    Make us willing to be thine.

2   Where thou hast thy work begun,
    Give new strength the race to run;
    Scatter darkness, doubts, and fears,
    Wipe away the mourners' tears.

3   Bless us all, both old and young;
    Call forth praise from every tongue:
    Let our whole assembly prove
    All thy power and all thy love!

The Closing Year.


1   And now, my soul, another year
      Of my short life is past:
    I cannot long continue here;
      And this may be my last.

2   Part of my doubtful life is gone,
      Nor will return again;
    And swift my fleeting moments run--
      The few which yet remain!

3   Awake, my soul! with all thy care
      Thy true condition learn;
    What are thy hopes--how sure, how fair,
      And what thy great concern?

4   Now a new space of life begins,
      Set out afresh for heaven;
    Seek pardon for thy former sins,
      Through Christ, so freely given.

5   Devoutly yield thyself to God,
      And on his grace depend;
    With zeal pursue the heavenly road,
      Nor doubt a happy end.

1   Time by moments steals away,
    First the hour and then the day;
    Small the daily loss appears,
    Yet it soon amounts to years.

2   Thus another year is flown;
    Now it is no more our own,
    If it brought or promised good,
    Than the years before the flood.

3   But may none of us forget
    It has left us much in debt;
    Who can tell the vast amount
    Placed to every one's account!

4   Favors, from the Lord received,
    Sins, that have his spirit grieved,
    Marked by an unerring hand,
    In his book recorded stand.

5   If we see another year,
    May thy blessing meet us here:
    Sun of righteousness, arise,
    Warm our hearts and bless our eyes.

    Swift as an Indian arrow flies,

2   The present moments just appear,
      Then slide away in haste;
    That we can never say, they're here;
      But only say, they're past.

3   Our life is ever on the wing,
      And death is ever nigh;
    The moment when our lives begin
      We all begin to die.

4   Yet, mighty God! our fleeting days
      Thy lasting favors share;
    Yet, with the bounties of thy grace,
      Thou load'st the rolling year.

5   'Tis sovereign mercy finds us food,
      And we are clothed with love;
    While grace stands pointing out the road
      Which leads our souls above.

1   Through every age, eternal God,

2   Long hadst thou reigned ere time began,
    Or dust was fashioned into man;
    And long thy kingdom shall endure,
    When earth and time shall be no more.

3   A thousand of our years amount
    Scarce to a day in thine account;
    Like yesterday's departed light,
    Or the last watch of ending night.

4   Death, like an overflowing stream,
    Sweeps us away; our life's a dream,
    An empty tale, a morning flower
    Cut down and withered in an hour.

2   How many precious souls are fled
    To the vast regions of the dead,
    Since, from this day, the changing sun
    Through his last yearly course has run!

3   We yet survive, but who can say,
    Or through the year, or month, or day,
    We shall retain this vital breath,
    Secure from all the shafts of death?

4   We hold our lives from thee alone,
    On earth, or in the worlds unknown;
    To thee our spirits we resign,
    Make them and own them all as thine.

5   Great Source of wisdom, teach my heart

    God thither, with paternal care,
      His face benignant bends;

      On faithful hearts descends.

2   To such, by hallowed lips expressed,
      His grace confirms his word,
    As once Cornelius' house it blest,
      From holy Peter heard:
    On prayer and praise, in faith preferred,

2   'Tis joy to think the angel train,
      Who 'mid heaven's temple shine,
    To seek our earthly temples deign,
      And in our anthems join.

3   But chief, 'tis joy to think that He,
      To whom his church is dear,
    Delights her gathered flock to see,
      Her joint devotions hear.

      While here such joys are given?

2   Still forget the things behind;
    Follow Christ in heart and mind;
    Toward the mark unwearied press;
    Seize the crown of righteousness,
    While we walk with God in light,
    God our hearts will still unite;
    Dearest fellowship we prove--
    Fellowship in Jesus, love.

3   Still, O Lord, our faith increase;
    Cleanse from all unrighteousness:
    Thee th' unholy cannot see:
    Make, O make us meet for thee:
    Every vile affection kill;
    Root out every seed of ill;
    Utterly abolish sin;
    Write thy law of love within.

Call to Social Worship.


1   O, come, and let th' assembly all
      To serve our God unite,
    And, mindful of the social call,
      Partake the social rite.

2   In token of the common vow,
      Be ours, with one consent,
    The worship of the lowly brow,
      And knees devoutly bent!

3   But chief, inflamed with heavenly fire,
      Devotion's better part,
    Be ours instinct with one desire,
      The worship of the heart!

4   Let each, let all, their prayers above,
      In one oblation bend,
    And God, the God of peace and love,
      On all, on each descend!

Call to Worship.


1   Father, united by thy grace,
      And each to each endeared
    With confidence we seek thy face,
      And know our prayer is heard.

2   Still let us own our common Lord,
      And bear his easy yoke,
    A band of love, a three-fold cord
      Which never can be broke.

3   Make us into one spirit drink;
      Baptize into one name;
    And let us always kindly think,
      And sweetly speak the same.

4   Touched by the loadstone of thy love,
      Let all our hearts agree;
    And ever towards each other move,
      And ever move towards thee.

For Brotherly Love.


1   God of love, we look to thee;
    Let us in thy Son agree;
    Show to us the Prince of Peace;
    Bid our jars forever cease.
    By thy reconciling love,
    Every stumbling-block remove;
    Each to each unite, endear;
    Come, and spread thy banner here.

2   Make us of one heart and mind,
    Courteous, pitiful, and kind;
    Lowly, meek, in thought and word,
    Altogether like our Lord.
    Let us for each other care;
    Each the other's burden bear;
    To thy church the pattern give;
    Show how true believers live.

3   Free from anger and from pride,
    Let us thus in God abide;
    All the depths of love express,
    All the heights of holiness.
    Let us, then, with joy remove
    To the family above;
    On the wings of angels fly;
    Show how true believers die.

Meeting of Christian Friends.


1   Kindred in Christ, for his dear sake,
      A hearty welcome here receive;
    May we together now partake
      The joys which only he can give.

2   May he by whose kind care we meet,
      Send his good Spirit from above,
    Make our communications sweet,
      And cause our hearts to burn with love.

3   Forgotten be each worldly theme,
      When Christians meet together thus;
    We only wish to speak of him
      Who lived, and died, and reigns, for us.

4   We'll talk of all he did, and said,
      And suffered, for us here below,
    The path he marked for us to tread,
      And what he's doing for us now.

For Social Worship.


1   Our God, where'er thy people meet,
    There they behold thy mercy-seat;
    Where'er they seek thee, thou art found,
    And every place is hallowed ground.

2   For thou, within no walls confined,
    Inhabitest the humble mind;
    Such ever bring thee where they come,
    And, going, take thee to their home.

3   Here may we prove the power of prayer
    To strengthen faith, and sweeten care;
    To teach our faint desires to rise,
    And bring all heaven before our eyes.

4   Lord, we are few, but thou art near;
    Nor short thine arm, nor deaf thine ear:
    O, rend the heavens, comes quickly down,
    And make a thousand hearts thine own!

Commendatory of Christian Union.


1   Blest with unearthly bliss were they
    Who saw the church's infant day,
    And strove their Christian part to bear,
    By sign and spirit joined with her.

2   The truth, which Christ's apostles taught,
    Then ruled each faithful convert's thought;
    Each aimed in unity to keep
    Unrent th' apostles' fellowship.

3   The bread, with rites harmonious broke,
    The union of all hearts bespoke;
    And prayer, with lips united prayed,
    The union of all minds displayed.

4   O thus that Christians still would live,
    And thus delightful witness give,
    How well the debt of love they know,
    To Christ and to his church they owe!

For Union.


1     Thou God of truth and love,
        We seek thy perfect way,
      Ready thy choice t' approve,
        Thy providence t' obey;
    Enter into thy wise design,
    And sweetly lose our will in thine.

2     Why hast thou cast our lot
        In the same age and place?
      And why together brought
        To see each other's face?
    To join with softest sympathy,
    And mix our friendly souls in thee?

3     Didst thou not make us one,
        That we might one remain,
      Together travel on,
        And bear each other's pain;
    Till all thy utmost goodness prove
    And rise renewed in perfect love?

For Union of Heart.


1   God, from whom all blessings flow,
    Perfecting the saints below,
    Hear us, who thy nature share,
    Who thy loving children are.
    Join us, in one spirit join,
    Let us still receive of thine:
    Still for more on thee we call,
    Thou who fillest all in all!
