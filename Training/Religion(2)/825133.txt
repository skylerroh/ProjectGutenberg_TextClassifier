persuaded," exclude all doubt. But what was the foundation of Paul's
assurance? It was in the infallibility of God alone. The epistles of
this great apostle, this mystical teacher, are often read, but seldom
understood; yet all the mystic way, its commencement, its progress, its
end, are described by St Paul, and even the divine life; but few are
able to understand it, and those to whom the light is given see it all
there clearer than the day.

Ah! if those who find it so difficult to leave themselves to God could
only experience this, they would confess that though the way might be
arduous, a single day of this life was a sufficient recompense for years
of trouble. But by what means does God bring the soul here? By ways
altogether opposed to natural wisdom and imagination. He builds up by
casting down; He gives life by killing. Oh! if I could tell what He
does, and the strange means which He uses to bring us here. But silence!
men are not able to hear it; those who have experienced it know what it
is. Here there is no need of place or time; all is alike, all places are
good; and wherever the order of God may take us, it is well, because all
means are useless and infinitely surpassed: when we have reached the
end, there is nothing left to wish for.

Here all is God: God is everywhere and in everything, and therefore to
the soul all is the same. Its religion is God Himself, always the same,
never interrupted; and if sometimes God pours some stream of His glory
upon its natural powers and sensibilities, it has no effect upon the
centre, which is always the same. The soul is indifferent either to
solitude or a crowd: it no longer looks forward to deliverance from the
body in order that it may be united to God. It is now not only united,
but transformed, changed into the Object of its love, which causes it no
longer to think of loving; for it loves God with His own love, and
naturally, though not inamissibly.




CHAPTER III.

IN WHICH IS EXPLAINED BY A COMPARISON THAT WHICH CONCERNS PERFECT UNION
OR DEIFORMITY--SECRETS OF GOD REVEALED TO HIS HIDDEN ONES, AND BY THEM
TO OTHERS--PERMANENCE AND PROGRESS OF THIS CONDITION, THOUGH
VARIABLE--NATURAL CAPACITY MUST BE LOST--THE PARTICIPATED CAPACITY OF
GOD BY TRANSFORMATION GLOWS INFINITELY.


A similitude occurs to my mind which appears very appropriate to this
subject: it is that of grain. First it is separated from the husk, which
sets forth conversion and separation from sin: when the grain is
separate and pure, it must be ground (by affliction, crosses, sickness,
&c.); when it is thus bruised and reduced to flour, there must still be
taken from it, not that which is impure, for this is gone, but all that
is coarse, that is, the bran; and when there is nothing left but the
fine flour, then it is made into bread for food. It appears as though
the flour were soiled, blackened, and blighted; that its delicacy and
whiteness were taken from it, in order that it may be made into a paste
which is far less beautiful than the flour. Lastly, this paste is
exposed to the heat of the fire. Now this is precisely what happens to
the soul of which I have been speaking. But after the bread is baked, it
is fit for the mouth of the king, who not only unites it to himself by
contact with it, but eats it, digests it, consumes it, and annihilates
it, that it may enter into his composition, and become part of himself.

You will observe that though the bread has been eaten by the king, which
is the greatest honour it can receive, and is its end, yet it cannot be
changed into his substance unless it be annihilated by digestion, losing
all its natural form and quality. Oh, how well this sets forth all the
conditions of the soul; that of union being very different to that of
transformation, in which the soul, in order to become one with God,
transformed and changed into Him, must not only be eaten, but digested,
that, after having lost all that was its own, it may become one with God
Himself: "That they all may be one, as Thou, Father, art in me, and I
in Thee; that they also may be one in us, I in them, and Thou in me,
that they may be made perfect in one." (John xvii. 21, 23). "He that is
joined unto the Lord is one spirit" (1 Cor. vi. 17).

This state is very little known, therefore it is not spoken of. O state
of life! how narrow is the way which leadeth unto thee! O love the most
pure of all, because Thou art God Himself! O love immense and
independent, which nothing can limit or straiten!

Yet these people appear quite common, as I have said, because they have
nothing outwardly to distinguish them, unless it be an infinite freedom,
which is often scandalised by those who are limited and confined within
themselves, to whom, as they see nothing better than they have
themselves, all that is different to what they possess appears evil. But
the holiness of these simple and innocent ones whom they despise is a
holiness incomparably more eminent than all which they consider holy,
because their own works, though performed with such strictness, have no
more strength than the principle in which they originate, which is
always the effort, though raised and ennobled, of a weak creature; but
those who are consummated in the divine union act in God by a principle
of infinite strength; and thus their smallest actions are more agreeable
to God than the multitude of heroic deeds achieved by others, which
appear so great in the sight of men. Therefore those in this degree do
not seek for great things to do, resting contented with being what God
makes them at each moment. These do more, without doing anything, for
the conversion of a kingdom, than five hundred preachers who have not
attained this condition.

God sometimes, however, permits these people to be known, though not
fully. Many people apply to them for instruction, to whom they
communicate a vivifying principle, by means of which many more are won
to Christ; but this is done, without care or anxiety, by pure
Providence. If people only knew the glory which is rendered to God by
such as these, who are scorned by the world, they would be astonished;
for it is they who render to God a glory worthy of Himself; because God,
acting as God within them, brings into them a glory worthy of Him.

Oh, how many Christians, quite seraphic in appearance, are far from
this! But in this condition, as in all others, there are souls more or
less divine. God hides them in His bosom, and under the veil of a most
common life, so that they may be known to Him alone, though they are His
delight. Here the secrets of God, in Himself and in the hearts of those
in whom He dwells, are revealed; not by word, sight, or light, but by
the science of God, which abides in Him; and when such people have to
write or speak, they are themselves astonished to find that all flows
from a divine centre, without their having been aware that they
possessed such treasures. They find themselves in a profound science,
without memory or recollection; like an inestimable treasure, which is
unobserved until there is a necessity for its manifestation; and it is
in the manifestation to others that they find the revelation to
themselves. When they write, they are astonished to find themselves
writing of things with which they neither knew nor believed themselves
to be acquainted; although, as they write, they cannot doubt their
apprehension of them. It is not so with other Christians; their light
precedes their experience, as a person sees from afar the things which
he does not possess, and describes what he has seen, known, heard, &c.
But these are persons who hold a treasure within themselves, which they
do not see until after the manifestation, although it is in their
possession.

Yet, after all, this does not well express the idea which I wish to
convey. God is in this soul; or rather the soul no longer exists; it no
longer acts, but God acts, and it is the instrument. God includes all
treasures in Himself, and manifests them through this soul to others;
and thus, as it draws them from its centre, it becomes aware of their
presence, though it had never reflected upon them before. I am sure that
any who have attained this degree will enter into my meaning, and will
easily distinguish the difference between the states I have described.
Those whom I mentioned first, see things and enjoy them as we enjoy the
sun; but the others have become one with the sun itself, which does not
enjoy nor reflect upon its own light. This condition is permanent, and
its only vicissitude, so far as its centre is concerned, is a greater
advancement in God: and as God is infinite, He can continually make the
soul more divine by enlarging its capacity, as the water of which we
have spoken expands in proportion as it is lost in the sea, with which
it mingles incessantly without ever leaving it. It is the same with
these souls. All who are in this degree have God, but some more and some
less fully. They are all full, but all do not possess an equal
plenitude. A little vase when full is as truly filled as a larger one,
yet it does not contain an equal quantity. So all these souls are filled
with the fulness of God, but it is according to their receptive
capacity, which capacity God continually enlarges. Therefore the longer
Christians live in this divine condition, the more they expand, and
their capacity becomes continually more immense, without anything being
left for them to do or desire; for they always possess God in His
fulness, and He never leaves an empty corner in their hearts. As they
grow and enlarge, He fills them with Himself, as we see with the air. A
small room is full of air, but a large one contains more. If you
continually increase the size of a room, in the same proportion the air
will enter, infallibly though imperceptibly: and thus, without changing
its state or disposition, and without any new sensation, the soul
increases in capacity and in plenitude. But this growing capacity can
only be received in a state of nothingness, because in any other
condition there is an opposition to growth.

It may be well here to explain what may appear a contradiction, when I
say, that the soul must be brought to nothing in order to pass into God,
and that it must lose all that is its own; and yet I speak of capacity
which it retains.

There are two capacities. One is natural to the creature, and this is
narrow and limited: when it is purified, it is fitted to receive the
gifts of God, but not God Himself; because what we receive within us
must of necessity be less than ourselves, as that which is enclosed in a
vase must be of less extent, though it may be of greater value, than the
vase which contains it.

But the capacity of which I speak here is a capacity to extend and to
lose itself more and more in God, after the soul has lost its
appropriation, which confined it to itself; and this capacity being no
longer restricted nor limited, because its annihilation has deprived it
of all form, disposes the soul to flow into God, so that it loses
itself, and flows into Him who is beyond comprehension. The more it is
lost in Him, the more it develops and becomes immense, participating in
His perfections, and being more and more transformed in Him, as water in
communication with its source continually mingles with it. God, being
our original source, has created us with a nature fit to be united,
transformed, and made one with Himself.




CHAPTER IV.

THE FIRST MOVEMENTS OF THESE SOULS ARE DIVINE--THEIR SUFFERINGS ARE NOT
BY REFLECTION, BUT BY IMPRESSION--GREATNESS OF THESE SUFFERINGS, WHICH,
HOWEVER, DO NOT VARY THEIR REST OR CONTENTMENT BECAUSE OF THEIR
DEIFICATION, WHICH PROGRESSES INFINITELY, BUT GRADUALLY--THEIR PEACE
DISTURBED NEITHER BY GOOD NOR EVIL, AS GOD IS NEITHER TROUBLED NOR
DISTURBED BY THE SIGHT OF MAN'S SIN, ALL THINGS CONTRIBUTING TO HIS
GLORY.


The soul has now nothing to do but to remain as it is, and to follow
without resistance all the movements of its Guide. All its movements are
of God, and He guides it infallibly. It is not thus in the inferior
conditions, unless it be when the soul begins to taste of the centre;
but then it is not so infallible, and they would be deceived who applied
this rule to any but the most advanced state.

It is the duty of this soul to follow blindly with reflection all the
movings of God. Here all reflection is banished, and the soul would
find a difficulty in indulging in it, even if it desired to do so. But
as by an effort it might accomplish it, this habit should be
scrupulously avoided; because reflection alone has the power of leading
man to enter into himself, and of drawing him out of God. Now, I say,
that if man does not go out of God he will never sin; and if he sin, it
is because he has gone out of Him, which can only be the effect of
appropriation; and the soul can only take itself back from its
abandonment by reflex action, which would be to it a hell similar to
that into which the great angel fell when, looking with complacency upon
himself, and preferring himself to God, he became a devil. And this
state would be more terrible as that which had been previously attained
was more advanced.

It will be objected that suffering is impossible in this condition, not
only as to the centre, but also as to the senses, because in order to
suffering there must be reflex action, and it is reflection which
constitutes the principal and the most painful part of suffering. All
this is true in a certain sense; and as it is a fact that souls far less
advanced than these suffer sometimes by reflection, sometimes by
impression, I maintain that it is also true that those in this degree
cannot suffer otherwise than by impression. This does not imply that
sorrow may not be unlimited, and far more intense than that which is
reflected, as the burning of one brought into actual contact with fire
would be much more severe than that of one who is burned by the
reflection of fire. It will be said, But God can teach them by means of
reflection how to suffer. God will not make use of reflection for this
end. He can show them in a moment what they have to suffer by a direct
view, and not by a reflected one, as those in heaven see in God that
which is in Him, and that which passes out from Him to His creatures,
without looking at these things or reflecting upon them, but remaining
absorbed and lost in God. It is this which deceives so many
spiritually-minded people, who imagine that nothing can be either known
or suffered but by reflection. On the contrary, this kind of knowledge
and suffering is very slight compared to that which is imparted in other
ways.

All such suffering as can be distinguished and known, though expressed
in such exaggerated terms, does not equal that of those who do not know
their suffering, and cannot admit that they do suffer, because of the
great separation between the two parts. It is true that they suffer
extreme pain; it is true that they suffer nothing, and that they are in
a state of perfect contentment.

I believe that, if such a soul were taken to hell, it would suffer all
the cruel tortures of its fate in a complete contentment, because of the
beatitude of its transformed centre; and this is the cause of the
indifference which they feel towards all conditions.

As I have said, this does not prevent their experiencing the extremity
of suffering, as the extremity of suffering does not hinder their
perfect happiness. Those who have experienced it will be well able to
understand me.

It is not here as in the passive state of love. There the soul is filled
with a love of suffering and of the good pleasure of God: here it is a
loss of the will in God by a state of deification, where all is God
without its being recognised as such. The soul is established by its
condition in its sovereign, unchangeable good. It is in a perfect
beatitude, where nothing can cross its perfect happiness, which is
rendered its permanent condition; for many possess it temporarily, or
know it temporarily, before it becomes their permanent condition. God
gives first the knowledge of the condition, then a desire for it; then
He gives it confusedly and indistinctly; and lastly, He makes it a
normal condition, and establishes the soul in it for ever.

It will be said that when once the soul is established in this
condition, nothing more can be done for it. It is just the reverse:
there is always an infinitude to be done on the part of God, not on that
of the creature. God does not make the life divine all at once, but by
degrees. Then, as I have said, He enlarges the capacity of the soul, and
can continually deify it more and more, God being an unfathomable depth.

O Lord! "how great is Thy goodness, which Thou hast laid up for them
that fear Thee!" (Ps. xxxi. 19).

It was the sight of this state of blessedness which elicited such
frequent exclamations from David after he had been purified from sin.

But in conclusion, I say that these persons cannot be troubled by sin,
because, although they hate it infinitely, they no longer suffer from
it, seeing it as God sees it; and though, if it were necessary, they
would give their lives to prevent the commission of a single sin, if God
so willed it, they are without action, without desire, without
inclination, without choice, without impatience, in a state of complete
death, seeing things only as God sees them, and judging them only with
God's judgment.
