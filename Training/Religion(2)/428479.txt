      By the hands of cruel men;
      Great Thy load of sorrow then;
    Angel hosts were sore amazed.

                                   III

    Dark the world while in the tomb,
      Lone in death the Saviour lay,
      Till the stone was rolled away,
    And His Rising quelled the gloom.

                                   IV

    Fadeless now, O Light of light,
      Glory of the Father, Thou,
      Shine upon Thy people now,
    Rise upon their darkest night.




                                    I

    Hail rising morn! for He hath risen;
      Hail light that gilds the Eastern skies;
    For, from the bonds of darkest prison,
      Thy first beams saw the Christ arise.

                                   II

    O merciful and gracious One!
      The gates of Hades Thou hast rent,
    And by Thy Rising, Christ the Son,
      No more we lie in bondage pent.

                                   III

    To-day the lips of Adam sing;
      Eve hails the Christ of mankind born;
    And patriarchs and prophets bring
      Their hymns to greet the wondrous morn.

                                   IV

    And Thine the glory, Thine the power,
      By glowing hearts in praise expressed;
    For Thine the might, this glorious hour,
      By which the sons of men are blessed.




                                    I

    We worship, Lord, before Thee now,
    For great, and good, and pure art Thou.
    O Christ, the God, our stumblings heal,
    And lead us all Thy love to feel.

                                   II

    For of Thy will it pleased Thee well
    Here, in our flesh, with us to dwell,
    To bear the Cross, that we might be
    From Satan's servitude set free.

                                   III

    Wherefore we cry aloud and praise,
    With thankful voice, Thy name always;
    For, O! our Saviour, Thou didst bring
    The joy that makes our souls to sing.




                                    I

    Heavy laden with thy grief,
      Do thy tears like raindrops flow?
    Christ hath all thy sorrows borne
              Long ago.

                                   II

    See Him in the garden, prone,
      While He poured His soul to God;
    Then He bore affliction keen,
              And the rod.

                                   III

    Weary, laden with thy sin,
      Dost thou bow beneath the load?
    Cast the burden of thy woe,
              On thy God.

                                   IV

    See Him faint beneath the load,
      As He bears the ghastly tree;
    Hear His weary spirit sigh,
              All for thee.

                                    V

    Sad and doubting, lo! the sun
      Shines upon a glorious day:
    He is risen! come, see the place
              Where He lay.

                                   VI

    Glory to our suffering Lord,
      Praise to our exalted King,--
    Source of life and endless bliss,--
              Let us bring.




                                    I

    To Thee, O Christ, our God,
      Great Shepherd, who didst bear
    The wandering sheep that strayed
      Back to Thy shepherd care;

                                   II

    Who, pitying, gav'st Thy life,
      That we might stray no more,--
    To Thee our hearts we raise,
      And Thee our songs adore.

                                   III

    Blest Spirit, source of life,
      From Hades' fearful gloom
    Thou brought'st the Shepherd, Christ,
      Who lay in mortal tomb,

                                   IV

    That He might still provide,
      And tend, and guard, and keep,
    Where'er His flock, abides
      One Shepherd, of His sheep.




                                    I

    Glory shone within the gloom,
      Vacant eyes in wonder gazed;
    Shook the portals of the tomb,
      And the prisoners stood amazed.

                                   II

    "Who is this in garb of light,
      Come to chase our night away?
    Who is this in glorious might,
      Brings to us eternal day?"

                                   III

    "Back! the triumph has been won;"
      Prone the powers of darkness lie,
    At the feet of God's own Son,
      Fresh from fields of victory.

                                   IV

    Glory, glory, life is ours!
      Hades heard the shout and feared;
    Sin and all satanic powers
      Saw the Victor as He neared.

                                    V

    Burst the gates and cast them down,
      Set the sighing prisoners free;
    Fear not though the tyrant frown,
      Christ hath purchased liberty,

                                   VI

    Sin is crushed and death is slain,
      See the Cross and Him who died!
    From the grave He rose again,
      Who for man was crucified.

                                   VII

    Hail! the Resurrection day,
      Hail! the gladness and the gain;
    "He is risen," the angels say,
      Yea, the Lord is risen again.




                                    I

    When Adam heard the voice of sin
      And fell before its power,
    The flowers of Paradise were shorn
      Of beauty in that hour.

                                   II

    And clouds obscured the heavenly light,
      And e'en the stars were dim;
    For O 'twas night, and only night,
      Dark night 'twixt God and him.

                                   III

    "O whence that flashing sword that gleams?
      And whence those angels there?"
    Out from the garden of their bliss,
      Was thrust the guilty pair.

                                   IV

    Life is not theirs, the tree of Life
      The Cherubim surround;
    Death dogs our guilty parents' steps,
      Curse blasts the fertile ground.

                                    V

    O dreary, dreary, dark and dread,
      O misery of sin!
    "God make another garden fair,
      And take Thy wanderers in."

                                   VI

    All praise to Christ our glorious Lord,
      For sin and death are slain;
    The gates of heaven are open wide,
      And life is ours again.




                                    I

    Within the garden's sombre shade,
      The Christ of God in anguish prayed;--
    And who that agony could tell,
      As from his brow the blood-drops fell?

                                   II

    "Can you not watch one hour?" He saith,
      "My soul is sorrowful to death."
    But He alone the vigil kept,
      While worn disciples slumbering slept.

                                   III

    O dark the cloud that threatening hung,
      And sore the grief His soul that wrung,--
    The hate of man, the guilty name,
      The bitter Cross, the sin and shame.

                                   IV

    "If I must drink this cup," He prayed,
      "The burden bear upon me laid,
    My God, I bow Me to Thy will,
      And meekly Thy behest fulfil."

                                    V

    My soul, when to the garden led,
      And clouds are gathering overhead,
    When none the hour of anguish shares,
      To God direct thy earnest prayers.

                                   VI

    "Thy will be done, Thy will is best,--
      Even then the bitter cup is blest,--
    If 'tis Thy will the cup I'll drain,
      Despite the agony of pain."
