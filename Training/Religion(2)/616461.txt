THE FOUR GOSPELS


I. BRIEF INTRODUCTION

1. Name five portions of Scripture that are repeated.

2. Four reasons why the Lord's life is recorded four times:

(1) To emphasize its importance.

(2) To multiply the testimony to His life in the flesh.

(3) To present the different aspects of His character.

(4) To reach different classes of people.

NOTE.--The Gospels were originally sermons, and the authors preachers.
They are not designed as biographies. One has described them as "memoirs
of a life, to teach a religion." Hence one need not expect chronological
order. Their purpose is not to record the life of Christ, but to win a
lost world to the Savior.
