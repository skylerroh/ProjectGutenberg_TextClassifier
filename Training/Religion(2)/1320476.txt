The Happiness of the Righteous.


1   The man, in life wherever placed,
      Hath happiness in store,
    Who walks not in the wicked's way,
      Nor learns their guilty lore:

2   Nor from the seat of scornful pride
      Casts forth his eyes abroad,
    But with humility and awe,
      Still walks before his God.

3   That man shall flourish like the trees
      Which by the streamlets grow;
    The fruitful top is spread on high,
      And firm the root below.

4   But he whose blossom buds in guilt
      Shall to the ground be cast,
    And, like the rootless stubble, tossed
      Before the sweeping blast.

1   Sweet is the bliss of souls serene,
    When they have sworn and steadfast mean,
    Counting the cost, in all t' espy
    Their God, in all themselves deny.

2   O could we learn that sacrifice,
    What lights would all around us rise!
    How would our hearts with wisdom talk,
    Along life's dullest, dreariest walk!

3   We need not bid, for cloistered cell,
    Our neighbor and our work farewell,
    Nor strive to wind ourselves too high
    For sinful man beneath the sky:

4   The trivial round, the common task,
    Would furnish all we ought to ask;
    Room to deny ourselves; a road
    To bring us, daily, nearer God.

Joy and Peace in Believing.


1   Sometimes a light surprises
      The Christian while he sings:
    It is the Lord, who rises
      With healing in his wings:
    When comforts are declining,
      He grants the soul again
    A season of clear shining,
      To cheer it after rain.

2   In holy contemplation,
      We sweetly then pursue
    The theme of God's salvation,
      And find it ever new:
    Set free from present sorrow,
      We cheerfully can say,
    "E'en let the unknown morrow
      Bring with it what it may."

3   It can bring with it nothing,
      But he will bear us through:
    Who gives the lilies clothing,
      Will clothe his people too:
    Beneath the spreading heavens,
      No creature but is fed;
    And he who feeds the ravens,
      Will give his children bread.

4   Though vine, nor fig tree neither,
      Its wonted fruit should bear;
    Though all the field should wither,
      Nor flocks, nor herds be there:
    Yet God the same abiding,
      His praise shall tune my voice;
    For while in him confiding,
      I cannot but rejoice.

For a Right Spirit.


1     I want a sober mind,
      A self-renouncing will,
    That tramples down and casts behind
      The baits of pleasing ill;
      A soul inured to pain,
      To hardship, grief and loss,
    Bold to take up, firm to sustain
      The consecrated cross.

2     I want a godly fear,
      A quick-discerning eye,
    That looks to thee when sin is near,
      And sees the tempter fly;
      A spirit still prepared,
      And armed with jealous care,
    Forever standing on its guard,
      And watching unto prayer.

3     I want a true regard,
      A single, steady aim,
    Unmoved by threatening or reward,
      To thee and thy great name;
      A zealous, just concern
      For thine immortal praise;
    A pure desire that all may learn
      And glorify thy grace.

2     The sorrows of the mind
      Be banished from the place!
    Religion never was designed
      To make our pleasures less.

3     The men of grace have found
      Glory begun below;
    Celestial fruits on earthly ground
      From faith and hope may grow.

4     The hill of Sion yields
      A thousand sacred sweets,
    Before we reach the heavenly fields,

      And every tear be dry;
    We're marching through Immanuel's ground,
      To fairer worlds on high.

Where is Heaven?


1     Our heaven is everywhere,
      If we but love the Lord,
    Unswerving tread the narrow way,
      And ever shun the broad.

2     'T is where the trusting heart
      Bows meekly to its grief,
    Still looking up with earnest faith
      For comfort and relief.

3     Where guileless infancy
      In happiness doth dwell,
    And where the aged one can say
      "He hath done all things well."

4     Wherever truth abides
      Sweet peace is ever there;
    If we but love and serve the Lord,
      Our heaven is everywhere.

Heaven Here.


1   Heaven is here; its hymns of gladness
      Cheer the true believer's way,
    In this world where sin and sadness
      Often change to night our day.

2   Heaven is here; where misery lightened
      Of its heavy load is seen,
    Where the face of sorrow brightened
      By the deed of love hath been:

3   Where the bound, the poor, despairing
      Are set free, supplied and blest;
    Where, in others' anguish sharing,
      We can find our surest rest.

4   Where we heed the voice of duty
      Rather than man's praise, or rod;
    This is heaven,--its peace, its beauty,
      Radiant with the smile of God.

God's Kingdom Here.


1   Oh, where, our Saviour! sweeps the line
      That marks thy kingdom's holy reign?
    Is it where northern meteors shine
      Or gilds the cross the southern main?
    Where breaks the dawn o'er spicy lands?
    Or twilight sleeps on desert sands?

2   Is it where sunny skies grow dim
      With smoke of heathen sacrifice?
    Or where, in costly domes, the hymn
      Is taught on incense clouds to rise?
    Nay, nay, thy blessed word has shown
    Thy kingdom is the heart alone!

3   That solemn world, whose bounds between
      Life's mysteries of birth and death,
    Are filled with warring hosts unseen,
      Beings of power, though not of breath--
    The spirit realm, where'er it be,
    Is the dominion swayed by thee.

4   Wild, phantom shapes of gloom and fear,
      Roam dimly through the haunted spot,
    And earth holds not a land so drear
      As the sad heart that owns thee not,
    Where sorrows wound and pleasures pall,
    And death's dread shadow darkens all.

5   But lift thy sceptre there, its bowers
      Shall be serene and sweet and fair,
    And, as in time's primeval hours,
      The holy ones shall gather there,
    And heaven's own peace the soul o'erflow,
    E'en while it lingers here below.

    Which can mock all hostile power;
    To thyself a tenant be,
    And inhabit safe and free.

3   Say not that this house is small,
    Girt up in a narrow wall;
    In a cleanly, sober mind,
    Heaven itself full room doth find.

4   The infinite Creator can
    Dwell in it; and may not man?
    Here, content, make thy abode

3   In each event of life, how clear
      Thy ruling hand I see!
    Each blessing to my soul more dear,
      Because conferred by thee.

4   In every joy that crowns my days,
      In every pain I bear,
    My heart shall find delight in praise,
      Or seek relief in prayer.

5   When gladness wings my favored hour,
      Thy love my thoughts shall fill;
    Resigned, when storms of sorrow lower,
      My soul shall meet thy will.

6   My lifted eye, without a tear,
      The gathering storm shall see;
    My steadfast heart shall know no fear;--
      That heart shall rest on thee!

2   The morning strengthens into noon;
      Earth's fairest beauties shine more fair;
    And noon and morning shall attune
      My grateful heart to praise and prayer.

3   When 'neath the evening western gate

4   As twilight wears a darker hue,
      And gathering night creation dims,
    The twilight and the midnight, too,
      Shall have their harmonies and hymns.

5   So shall sweet thoughts, and thoughts sublime,
      My constant inspirations be;
    And every shifting scene of time
      Reflect, my God, a light from thee.

2   I love to think on mercies past,
      And future good implore,
    And all my cares and sorrows cast
      On him whom I adore.

3   I love by faith to take a view
      Of brighter scenes in heaven;
    The prospect doth my strength renew,
      While here by tempests driven.

4   Thus, when life's toilsome day is o'er,
      May its departing ray
    Be calm as this impressive hour,

    That, in their furrows, dark with night,
    Her hand may sow the seeds of light;

2   Thy grace can send its breathings o'er
    The spirit, dark and lost before;
    And freshening all its depths, prepare
    For truth divine to enter there!

3   Till David touched his sacred lyre,
    In silence lay the unbreathing wire;
    But when he swept its chords along,
    E'en angels stooped to hear the song.

    Shall deign to touch its lifeless chord;
    Till, waked by thee, its breath shall rise
    In music worthy of the skies.

      Supplies the living stream;
    It is not at our own command,
      But still derived from him.

3     Man's wisdom is to seek
      His strength in God alone;
    And e'en an angel would be weak,
      Who trusted in his own.

4     Retreat beneath his wings,
      And in his grace confide;
    This more exalts the King of kings
      Than all your works beside.

5     In God is all our store,
      Grace issues from his throne;
    Whoever says, "I want no more,"
      Confesses he has none.

    And his countenance benign

    And lead me to the realms of day;
    To milder skies, and brighter plains,

    Why should I cleave to things below,
    And let my God, my Saviour go?

3   Call me away from flesh and sense;
    Thy sovereign word can draw me thence:
    I would obey the voice divine,
    And all inferior joys resign.

4   Be earth, with all her scenes, withdrawn,
    Let noise and vanity be gone:
    In secret silence of the mind,

      Thy perfect law above.

3   Our daily bread supply,
      While by thy word we live;
    The guilt of our iniquity
      Forgive, as we forgive.

4   From dark temptation's power
      Our feeble hearts defend;
    Deliver in the evil hour,
      And guide us to the end.

5   Thine, then, forever be
      Glory and power divine;
    The sceptre, throne, and majesty
      Of heaven and earth are thine.

The Lord's Prayer.


1   O Thou, enthroned in worlds above,
      Our Father and our Friend!
    Lo, at the footstool of thy love,
      Thy children humbly bend.

2   All reverence to thy name be given;
      Thy kingdom wide displayed;
    And, as thy will is done in heaven,
      Be it on earth obeyed.

3   Our table may thy bounty spread,
      From thine exhaustless store,
    From day to day with daily bread,--
      Nor would we ask for more.

4   That pardon we to others give,
      Do thou to us extend;
    From all temptation, Lord, relieve;
      From every ill defend.

5   And now to thee belong, Most High,
      The kingdom, glory, power,
    Through the broad earth and spacious sky,
      Both now and evermore.

Seeking God.


1   O Thou, whose power o'er moving worlds presides,
    Whose voice created, and whose wisdom guides,
    On darkling man in pure effulgence shine,
    And cheer his clouded mind with light divine.

2   'T is thine alone to calm the pious breast
    With silent confidence and holy rest;
    From thee, great God, we spring, to thee we tend;
    Path, Motive, Guide, Original, and End.

Abba, Father.


1     Behold, what wondrous grace
      The Father has bestowed
    On sinners of a mortal race,
      To call them sons of God!

2     Nor doth it yet appear
      How great we must be made;
    But when we see our Saviour here,
      We shall be like our Head.

3     A hope so much divine
      May trials well endure;
    May purify our souls from sin,
      As Christ, the Lord, is pure.

4     We would no longer lie
      Like slaves beneath the throne;
    Our faith shall Abba, Father, cry,
      And thou the kindred own.

The Christian's Resolve.


1   Ah wretched souls, who strive in vain,
      Slaves to the world, and slaves to sin!
    A nobler toil may I sustain,
      A nobler satisfaction win.

2   May I resolve, with all my heart,
      With all my powers, to serve the Lord;
    Nor from his precepts e'er depart,
      Whose service is a rich reward.

3   Be this the purpose of my soul,
      My solemn, my determined choice,
    To yield to his supreme control,
      And in his kind commands rejoice.

4   O may I never faint nor tire,
      Nor, wandering, leave his sacred ways;
    Great God! accept my soul's desire,
      And give me strength to live thy praise.

"Giving thanks to God in all things."


1   Great God! my joyful thanks to thee
    Shall, like thy gifts, continual be:
    In constant streams thy bounty flows,
    Nor end nor intermission knows.

2   Thy kindness all my comforts gives;
    My numerous wants thy hand relieves;
    Nor can I ever, Lord, be poor,
    Who live on thy exhaustless store.

3   If what I wish thy will denies,
    It is that thou art good and wise;
    Afflictions, which may make me mourn,
    Thou canst, thou dost, to blessings turn.

4   Deep, Lord, upon my thankful breast,
    Let all thy favors be imprest;
    And though withdrawn thy gifts should be
    In all things I'll give thanks to thee.

1   How rich thy favors, God of grace!
      How various, how divine!
    Full as the ocean they are poured,
      And bright as heaven they shine.

      That mercy shall attend,
    Which leads, through sufferings of an hour,

Praying for Divine Help.


1   O Help us, Lord! each hour of need
      Thy heavenly succor give;
    Help us in thought, and word, and deed,
      Each hour on earth we live.

2   O help us, when our spirits bleed,
      With contrite anguish sore,
    And when our hearts are cold and dead,
      O help us, Lord, the more.

3   O help us through the prayer of faith
      More firmly to believe;
    For still the more the servant hath,
      The more shall he receive.

4   O help us, Father! from on high;
      We know no help but thee;
    O! help us so to live and die,
      As thine in heaven to be.

Come, let us Pray.


1     Come, let us pray: 'tis sweet to feel
        That God himself is near;
      That, while we at his footstool kneel,
        His mercy deigns to hear:
    Though sorrows cloud life's dreary way,
    This is our solace--let us pray.

2     Come, let us pray: the burning brow,
        The heart oppressed with care,
      And all the woes that throng us now,
        Will be relieved by prayer:
    Our God will chase our griefs away;
    O, glorious thought!--come, let us pray.

3     Come, let us pray: the mercy-seat
        Invites the fervent prayer.
      Our Heavenly Father waits to greet
        The contrite spirit there:
    O, loiter not, nor longer stay
    From him who loves us; let us pray.

Imploring the constant Presence of God.


1   When Israel of the Lord beloved,
      Out from the land of bondage came,
    Her father's God before her moved,
      An awful guide in smoke and flame.

2   By day, along th' astonished lands,
      The cloudy pillar glided slow;
    By night, Arabia's crimsoned sands
      Returned the fiery column's glow.
