                And our mountain retreat, Hale-mano.
                Here, fenced from each other by tabu,
                Your graces make sport for the crowd.
                What then the solution? Let us dwell
           20   At Waimea and feast on the fish
                That swarm in the neighboring sea,
                With freedom to you and freedom to me,
                Licensed by Ku and by Ahu-ena.

           The scene of this idyl is laid in the district of Waialua,
           Oahu, but the poet gives his imagination free range
           regardless of the unities. The chief subjects of interest
           that serve as a trellis about which the human sentiments
           entwine concern the duties of the fisherman, who is also a
           farmer; the school for the hula, in which the hero and the
           heroine are pupils; and lastly an ideal condition of
           happiness which the lovers look forward to tinder the
           benevolent dispensation of the gods Ku and Ahuena.

           Among the numerous relatives of Pele was one said to be a
           sister, who was stationed on a bleak sun-burnt promontory in
           Koolau, Oahu, where she supported a half-starved existence,
           striving to hold soul and body together by gathering the
           herbs of the fields, eked out by unsolicited gifts of food
           contributed by passing travelers. The pathetic plaint given
           below is ascribed to this goddess.

                        _Mele_

                Mao wale i ka lani
                Ka leo o ke Akua pololi.
                A pololi a moe au
                O ku'u la pololi,
            5   A ola i kou aloha;
                I na'i pu no i ka waimaka e uwe nei.
                E uwe kaua, e!

                        [Translation]

                           _Song_

                Engulfed ill heaven's abyss
                Is the cry of the famished god.
                I sank to the ground from faintness,
                My day of utter starvation;
            5   Was rescued, revived, by your love:
                Ours a contest of tears sympathetic--
                Let us pour out together our tears.

           The Hawaiian thought it not undignified to express sympathy
           (_aloha-ino_) with tears.

                           XXXVI.--THE HULA HOO-NA-NA


           The hula _hoo-na-na_--to quiet, amuse--was an informal dance,
           such as was performed without the usual restrictions of tabu
           that hedged about the set dances of the halau. The occasion
           of an outdoor festival, an _ahaaina_ or _luau_, was made the
           opportunity for the exhibition of this dance. It seems to
           have been an expression of pure sportiveness and
           mirth-making, and was therefore performed without sacrifice
           or religious ceremony. While the king, chiefs, and
           _aialo_--courtiers who ate in the king's presence--are
           sitting with the guests about the festal board, two or three
           dancers of graceful carriage make a circuit of the place,
           ambling, capering, gesturing as they go in time to the words
           of a gay song.

           A performance of this sort was witnessed by the author's
           informant in Honolulu many years ago; the occasion was the
           giving of a royal luau. There was no musical instrument, the
           performers were men, and the mele they cantillated went as
           follows:

                A pili, a pili,
                A pili ka'u manu
                Ke kepau[485] o ka ulu-laau.
                Poai a puni,
           5    Noho ana i muli-wa'a;[486]
                Hoonu'u ka momona a ke alii.
                Eli-eli[487] ke kapu; ua noa.
                Noa ia wai?
                Noa ia ka lani.
           10   Kau lilua,[488] kaohi ka maku'u
                E ai ana ka ai a ke alii!
                Hoonu'u, hoonu'u hoonu'u
                I ka i'a a ke alii!

           [Footnote 485: _Kepau._ Gum, the bird-lime of the fowler,
           which was obtained from forest trees, but especially from the
           _ulu_, the breadfruit.]

           [Footnote 486: _Muli-wa'a_ (_muli_, a term applied to a younger
           brother). The idea involved is that of separation by an
           interval, as a younger brother is separated from his older
           brother by an interval. _Muliwai_ is an interval of water, a
           stream. _Wa'a_, the last part of the above compound word,
           literally a canoe, is here used tropically to mean the
           tables, or the dishes, on which the food was spread, they
           being long and narrow, in the shape of a canoe. The whole
           term, consequently, refers to the people and the table about
           which they are seated.]

           prayers to emphasize the word _kapu_ or the word _noa_.]

                      Free! and By whom?
                      Free by the word of the king.

                      With the good king's meat!

                           XXXVII.--THE HULA ULILI


           The hula _ulili_, also called by the descriptive name
           _kolili_--to wave or flutter, as a pennant--was a hula that
           was not at all times confined to the tabu restrictions of the
           halau. Like a truant schoolboy, it delighted to break loose
           from restraint and join the informal pleasurings of the
           people. Imagine an assembly of men and women in the
           picturesque illumination given by flaring kukui torches, the
           men on one side, the women on the other. Husbands and wives,
           smothering the jealousy instinctive to the human heart, are
           there by mutual consent--their daughters they leave at
           home--each one ready to play his part to the finish, with no
           thought of future recrimination. It was a game of
           love-forfeits, on the same lines as kilu and ume.

           Two men, armed with wands furnished with tufts of gay
           feathers, pass up and down the files of men and women, waving
           their decorated staffs, ever and anon indicating with a touch
           of the wand persons of the opposite sex, who under the rules
           must pay the forfeit demanded of them. The kissing, of
           course, goes by favor. The wand-bearers, as they move along,
           troll an amorous ditty:

                              _Oli_

                      Kii na ka ipo ...
                      Mahele-liele i ka la o Kona![489]
                      O Kona, kai a ke Akua.[490]

           15   Ho, now comes the fun!

                            XXXVIII.--THE HULA O-NIU


           The so-called hula _o-niu_ is not to be classed with the
           regular dances of the halau. It was rather a popular sport,
           in which men and women capered about in an informal dance
           while the players engaged in a competitive game of
           top-spinning: The instrument of sport was made from the lower
           pointed half of an oval coconut shell, or from the
           corresponding part of a small gourd. The sport was conducted
           in the presence of a mixed gathering of people amid the
           enthusiasm and boisterous effervescence which betting always
           greatly stimulated in Hawaii.

           The players were divided into two sides of equal number, and
           each player had before him a plank, slightly hollowed in the
           center--like the board on which the Hawaiians pounded their
           poi--to be used as the bed for spinning his top. The naked
           hand, unaided by whip or string, was used to impart to the
           rude top a spinning motion and at the same time the necessary
           projectile force--a balancing of forces that called for nice
           adjustment, lest the whirling thing reel too far to one side
           or run wild and fly its smooth bed. Victory was declared and
           the wager given to the player whose top spun the longest.

           The feature that most interests us is the singing, or
           cantillation, of the oli. In a dance and game of this sort,
           which the author's informant witnessed at Kahuku, Oahu, in
           1844, one contestant on each side, in turn, cantillated an
           oli during the performance of the game and the dance.

                          _Oli_

                Ke poha, nei; u'ina la!
                Kani ole-olei, hau-walaau!

                Kani ka aka, he-hene na pali,
            5   Na pali o Ka-iwi-ku'i.[496]
                Hanohano, makana i ka Wai-opua.[497]
                Malihini ka hale, ua hiki mai;
                Kani ka pahu a Lohiau,
                A Lohiau-ipo[498] i Haena la.
           10   Enaena ke aloha, ke hiki mai;
[Page 249]      Auau i ka wai a Kanaloa.[499]
                Nana kaua ia Lima-hull,[500] e.

                Ka ia nei o-niu.

           waves dash.]

           [Footnote 497: _Wai-opua_. The name of a pleasant breeze.]

           [Footnote 498: _Lohiau-ipo_. The epithet _ipo_, sweetheart,
           dear one, was often affixed to the name of Lohiau, in token,
           no doubt, of his being distinguished as the object of Pele's
           passionate regard.]

           [Footnote 499: _Kanaloa_. There is a deep basin, of clear
           water, almost fluorescent in its sparkle, in one of the
           arched caves of Haena, which is called the water of
           Kanaloa--the name of the great God. This is a favorite
           bathing place.]

           [Footnote 500: Lima-huli. The name of a beautiful valley that
           lies back of Haena.]

[Translation]

                                      Song

                      The rustle and hum of spinning top,
                      Wild laughter and babel of sound--
                      Hear the roar of the waves at Pu'u-hina!
                      Bursts of derision echoed from cliffs,
                 5    The cliffs of Ka-iwi-ku'i;
                      And the day is stirred by a breeze.
                      The house swarms with women and men.
                      List! the drum-beat of Lohiau,
                      Lohiau, the lover, prince of Haena--
                10    Love glows like an oven at his coming;
                      Then to bathe in the lake of the God.
                      Let us look at the vale Lima-huli, look!
                      Now turn we and study the spinning--
                      That trick we must catch to be winning.

           This fragment from antiquity, as the local coloring
           indicates, finds its setting at Haena, the home of the famous
           mythological Prince Lohiau, of whom Pele became enamored in
           her spirit journey. Study of the mele suggests the occasion
           to have been the feast that was given in celebration of
           Lohiau's restoration to life and health through the
           persevering incantations of Hiiaka, Pele's beloved sister.
           The feast was also Lohiau's farewell to his friends at Haena.
           At its conclusion Hiiaka started with her charge on the
           journey which ended with the tragic death of Lohiau at the
           brink of the volcano. Pele in her jealousy poured out her
           fire and consumed the man whom she had loved.

                               XXXIX.--THE HULA KU'I


           The account of the Hawaiian hulas would be incomplete if
           without mention of the hula _ku'i_. This was an invention, or
           introduction, of the last quarter of the nineteenth century.
           Its formal, public, appearance dates from the coronation
           ceremonies of the late King Kalakaua, 1883, when it filled an
           important place in the programme. Of the 262 hula
           performances listed for exhibition, some 30 were of the hula
           ku'i. This is perhaps the most democratic of the hulas, and
           from the date' of its introduction it sprang at once into
           public favor. Not many years ago one could witness its
           extemporaneous performance by nonprofessionals at many an
           entertainment and festive gathering. Even the
           school-children took it up and might frequently be seen
           innocently footing its measures on the streets. (Pl. XXIV.)

           The steps and motions of the hula ku'i to the eyes of the
           author resemble those of some Spanish dances. The rhythm is
           in common, or double, time. One observes the following
           motions:

           _Figure A_.--1. A step obliquely forward with the left foot,
           arms pointing the same way, body inclining to the right. 2.
           The ball of the left foot (still advanced) gently pressed on
           the floor; the heel swings back and forth, describing an arc
           of some 30 or 40 degrees. 8. The left foot is set firmly in
           the last position, the body inclining to it as the base of
           support; the right foot is advanced obliquely, and 4,
           performs the heel-swinging motions above described, arms
           pointing obliquely to the right.

           _Figure B_.--Hands pressed to the waist, fingers directed
           forward, thumbs backward, elbows well away from the body;
           left foot advanced as in figure A, 1, body inclining to the
           right. 2. The left foot performs the heel-waving motions, as
           above. 3. Hands in same position, right foot advanced as
           previously described. 4. The right foot performs the swinging
           motions previously described--the body inclined to the left.

           _Figure C_.--In this figure, while the hands are pressed as
           before against the waist, with the elbows thrown well away
           from the body, the performer sways the pelvis and central
           axis of the trunk in a circular or elliptical orbit, a
           movement, which, carried to the extreme, is termed ami.

           There are other figures and modifications, which the
           ingenuity and fancy of performers have introduced into this
           dance; but this account must suffice.

LADY DANCING THE HULA KU'I]

[Page 251]
           Given a demand for a _pas seul_, some pleasing dance
           combining grace with dexterity, a shake of the foot, a twist
           of the body, and a wave of the hands, the hula ku'i filled
           the bill to perfection. The very fact that it belonged by
           name to the genus hula, giving it, as it were, the smack of
           forbidden fruit, only added to its attractiveness. It became
           all the rage among dancing folk, attaining such a vogue as
           almost to cause a panic among the tribunes and censors of
           society. Even to one who cares nothing for the hula per se,
           save as it might be a spectacle out of old Hawaii, or a
           setting for an old-time song, the innocent grace and
           Delsartian flexibility of this solo dance, which one can not
           find in its Keltic or African congeners, associate it in mind
           with the joy and light-heartedness of man's Arcadian period.

           The instruments generally used in the musical accompaniment
           of the hula ku'i are the guitar, the _uku-lele_,[501] the
           taro-patch fiddle,[501] or the mandolin; the piano also lends
           itself effectively for this purpose; or a combination of
           these may be used.

           The songs that are sung to this dance as a rule belong
           naturally to later productions of the Hawaiian muse, or to
           modifications of old poetical compositions. The following
           mele was originally a namesong (mele-inoa). It was
           appropriated by the late Princess Kino-iki; and by her it was
           passed on to Kalani-ana-ole, a fact which should not
           prejudice our appreciation of its beauty.


                               _Mele_

                      I aloha i ke ko a ka wai,

                      Ka wanine noho anu o ke kula.

                      I ka wai awili me ke kai.
                      Ke ono hou nei ku'u pu'u
                      I ka wai hu'ihu'i o ka uka,
[Page 252]       15   Wai hone i ke kumu o ka pali,
                      I malu i ka lau kui-kui.[505]
                      Ke kuhi nei au a he pono

                      Au i kau nui aku ai,
                 20   I ka nani oi a oia pua.

           [Footnote 501: The _uku-lele_ and the _taro-patch fiddle_ are
           stringed instruments resembling in general appearance the
           fiddle. They seem to have been introduced into these islands
           by the Portuguese immigrants who have come in within the last
           twenty-five years. As with the guitar, the four strings of
           the uku-lele or the five strings of the taro-patch fiddle are
           plucked with the finger or thumb.]

           [Footnote 502: _Na pua o ka laina_. The intent of this
           expression, which seems to have an erotic meaning, may
           perhaps be inferred from its literal rendering in the
           translation. It requires a tropical imagination to follow a
           Hawaiian poem.]

           Nawiliwili, Kauai. The local names for winds differed on the
           various islands and were multiplied almost without measure:
           as given in the mythical story of Kama-pua'a, or in the
           semihistoric tale of Ku-a-Paka'a, they taxed the memories of
           raconteurs.]

           (Aleurites triloba), popularly known by some as the

           in making torches. _Kukui_, or _tutui_, is the name now
           applied to the tree, also to a torch or lamp. The Samoan
           language still retains the archaic name _tuitui_. This is one
           of the few instances in which the original etymology of a
           word is retained in Hawaiian poetry.]

                How pleasing, when borne by the tide,
                One says, you and I are a-cold.
                The buds of the center are chilled
                Of the woman who shivers on shore.
            5   I stood on the height Poli-ahu;
                The ocean enrobed Wai-lua.
                Ah, strange are the pranks of the wind,
                The Kiu-ke'e wind of the pali!
                It smites now the ocean at Puna--
           10   That's always the fashion at Puna.
                Gone, gone is the last of my love,
                At this mixture of brine in my drink!
                My mouth is a-thirst for a draught
                Of the cold mountain-water,
           15   That plays at the foot of the cliff,
                In the shade of the kui-kui tree.
                I thought our love-flower, ilima--
                Oft worn as a garland by you--
                Still held its color most true.
           20   You'd exchange its beauty for rue!

                               _Song_

                Fame trumpets your conquests each day,
                Brave Lily Victoria!
                Your scepter finds new hearts to sway,
                Subdues the Pacific's wild waves,
            5   Your foes are left stranded ashore,
                Firm heart as of steel!
                Dame Rumor tells us with glee
                Your fortunes wax evermore,
                Beauty of Aina-hau,
           10   Comrade dear to my heart.
                And what of the hyacinth maid,
                Nymph of the Flowery Land?
                I choose the lehua, ilima,
                As my wreath and emblem of love,
           15   The small-leafed fern and the maile--
                What fragrance exhales from thy breast!

           The story that might explain this modern lyric belongs to the
           gossip of half a century ago. The action hinges about one who
           is styled Pua Lanakila--literally Flower of Victory. Now
           there is no flower, indigenous or imported, known by this
           name to the Hawaiians. It is an allegorical invention of the
           poet. A study of the name and of its interpretation, Victory,
           at once suggested to me the probability that it was meant for
           the Princess Victoria Kamamalu.

           As I interpret the story, the lover seems at first to be in a
           condition of unstable equilibrium, but finally concludes to
           cleave to the flowers of the soil, the _lehua_ and the
           _ilima_ (verse 15), the _palai_ and the _maile_ (verse 17),
           the meaning of which is clear.

                                   XL.--THE OLI


           The Hawaiian word _mele_ included all forms of poetical
           composition. The fact that the mele, in whatever form, was
           intended for cantillation, or some sort of rhythmical
           utterance addressed to the ear, has given to this word in
           modern times a special meaning that covers the idea of song
           or of singing, thus making it overlap ambiguously into the
           territory that more properly belongs to the word _oli_. The
           oli was in strict sense the lyric utterance of the Hawaiians.

           In its most familiar form the Hawaiians--many of whom
           possessed the gift of improvisation in a remarkable
           degree--used the oli not only for the songful expression of
           joy and affection, but as the vehicle of humorous or
           sarcastic narrative in the entertainment of their comrades.
