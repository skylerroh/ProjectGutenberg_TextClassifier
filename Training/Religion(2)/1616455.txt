2 Thro' this changing world below,
Lead me gently, gently as I go;
Trusting thee, I cannot stray,
I can never, never lose my way.

3 Let me love thee more and more,
Till this fleeting, fleeting life is o'er;
Till my soul is lost in love,
In a brighter, brighter world above.

_Love to Christ Desired._     (584)

More love to thee, O Christ,
  More love to thee!
Hear thou the prayer I make
  On bended knee:
This is my earnest plea--
More love, O Christ, to thee!
  More love to thee!

2 Once earthly joy I craved--
  Sought peace and rest;
Now thee alone I seek:
  Give what is best.
This all my prayer shall be--
More love, O Christ, to thee;
  More love to thee!

3 Then shall my latest breath
  Whisper thy praise;
This be the parting cry
  My heart shall raise--
This still its prayer shall be,
More love, O Christ, to thee!
  More love to thee!

_Nearer to God._     (709)

Nearer, my God, to thee,
  Nearer to thee;
E'en though it be a cross
  That raiseth me.
Still all my song shall be
Nearer, my God, to thee,--
  Nearer to thee.

2 Though like the wanderer
  The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me,
  My rest a stone,
Yet, in my dreams, I'd be
Nearer, my God! to thee,--
  Nearer to thee.

3 There let the way appear,
  Steps unto heaven;
All that thou send'st to me,
  In mercy given;
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God! to thee,--
  Nearer to thee.

4 Or if, on joyful wing,
  Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
  Upward I fly,
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God! to thee,--
  Nearer to thee.

Fade, fade, each earthly joy,
      Jesus is mine:
Break ev'ry mortal tie;
      Jesus is mine.
Dark is the wilderness,
Distant the resting-place;
Jesus alone can bless,
      Jesus is mine.

2 Tempt not my soul away:
      Jesus is mine:
Here would I ever stay;
      Jesus is mine:
Perishing things of clay,
Born but for one brief day!
Pass from my heart away,
      Jesus is mine.

3 Farewell, ye dreams of night!
      Jesus is mine:
Mine is a dawning bright,
      Jesus is mine:
All that my soul has tried,
Left but a dismal void;
Jesus has satisfied;
      Jesus is mine.

4 Farewell, mortality!
      Jesus is mine:
Welcome, eternity!
      Jesus is mine:
Welcome, ye scenes of rest!
Welcome, ye mansions blest!
Welcome a Savior's breast;
      Jesus is mine.

_Jesus a Joy._

Ask ye what great thing I know
That delights and stirs me so?
What the high reward I win?
Whose the name I glory in?
  Jesus Christ, the crucified.

2 What is faith's foundation strong?
What awakes my lips to song?
He who bore my sinful load,
Purchased for me peace with God;
  Jesus Christ, the crucified.

3 Who is life in life to me?
Who the death of death will be?
Who will place me on his right
With the countless hosts of light?
  Jesus Christ, the crucified.

4 This is that great thing I know;
This delights and stirs me so;
Faith in him who died to save,
Him who triumphed o'er the grave,
  Jesus Christ, the crucified.

Oh, that I could forever dwell
  Delighted at the Savior's feet,
Behold the form I love so well,
  And all his tender words repeat.

2 The world shut out from all my soul,
  And heaven brought in with all its bliss,
Oh! is there aught, from pole to pole,
  One moment to compare with this?

3 This is the hidden life I prize,
  A life of penitential love,
When most my follies I despise,
  And raise my highest thoughts above.

4 When all I am I clearly see,
  And freely own with deepest shame;
When the Redeemer's love to me
  Kindles within a deathless flame.

5 Thus would I live till nature fail
  And all my former sins forsake;
Then rise to God within the veil,
  And of eternal joys partake.

_Praise for Salvation._     (529)

We praise thee, O God! for the Son of thy love,
For Jesus who died, and is now gone above.

Cho.--Hallelujah! thine the glory,
        Hallelujah! Amen.
      Hallelujah! thine the glory,
        Revive us again.

2 We praise thee, O God! for thy Spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Savior, and scattered our night.

3 All glory and praise to the Lamb that was slain,
Who has borne all our sins, and has cleansed ev'ry stain.

4 All glory and praise to the God of all grace,
Who has bought us, and sought us, and guided our ways.

5 Revive us again; fill each heart with thy love;
May each soul be rekindled with fire from above.

_Rejoicing in Christ._

Rejoice and be glad the Redeemer has come!
Go look on his cradle, his cross and his tomb.

Cho.--Sound his praises, tell the story,
        Of him who was slain,
      Sound his praises, tell with gladness,
        He liveth again.

2 Rejoice and be glad: for the blood has been shed;
Redemption is finished, the price has been paid.

3 Rejoice and be glad: for the Lamb that was slain,
O'er death is triumphant, and liveth again.

4 Rejoice and be glad: for our King is on high;
He pleadeth for us on his throne in the sky.

5 Rejoice and be glad: for he cometh again--
He cometh in glory, the Lamb that was slain.

     H. Bonar, 1874.


317     Welcome Voice. S.M.

_Going on to Perfection._

I hear thy welcome voice
  That calls me, Lord, to thee
For cleansing in thy precious blood
  That flowed on Calvary.

Cho.--I am coming, Lord!
        Coming now to thee!
      Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood
        That flowed on Calvary.

2 Tho' coming weak and vile,
  Thou dost my strength assure;
Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,
  Till spotless all and pure.

3 'Tis Jesus calls me on
  To perfect faith and love,
To perfect hope, and peace, and trust,
  For earth and heaven above.

4 'Tis Jesus who confirms
  The blessed work within,
By adding grace to welcomed grace,
  Where reigned the power of sin.

6 And he the witness gives
  To loyal hearts and free,
That every promise is fulfilled,
  If faith but brings the plea.

6 All hail, atoning blood!
  All hail, redeeming grace!
All hail, the gift of Christ, our Lord,
  Our strength and righteousness!

_Christ the Guide and Counselor._     (688)

Jesus, my truth, my way,
  My sure, unerring light,
On thee my feeble steps I stay,
  Which thou wilt guide aright.

2 My wisdom and my guide,
  My counselor thou art;
Oh, never let me leave thy side,
  Or from thy paths depart.

3 Never will I remove
  Out of thy hands my cause;
But rest in thy redeeming love,
  And hang upon thy cross.

4 Oh, make me all like thee,
  Before I hence remove;
Settle, confirm, and 'stablish me--
  And build me up in love.

     Charles Wesley.


319     Loving Kindness. L.M.

_Loving Kindness._     (699)

Awake, my soul, to joyful lays,
And sing thy great Redeemer's praise;
He justly claims a song from me,
His loving kindness, oh, how free!

2 He saw me ruined in the fall,
Yet loved me notwithstanding all;
He saved me from my lost estate--
His loving kindness, oh, how great!

3 Though numerous hosts of mighty foes--
Though earth and hell my way oppose;
He safely leads my soul along--
His loving kindness, oh, how strong!

4 When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,
Has gathered thick and thundered loud,
He near my soul has always stood--
His loving kindness, oh, how good!

     S. Medley, 1787.


320     Loving Kindness. L.M.

_Love Which Passeth Knowledge._

Of him who did salvation bring,
I could forever think and sing;
Arise, ye needy, he'll relieve;
Arise, ye guilty, he'll forgive.

2 Ask but his grace, and lo, 'tis given!
Ask, and he turns your hell to heaven;
Though sin and sorrow wound my soul,
Jesus, thy balm will make me whole.

3 'Tis thee I love, for thee alone,
I shed my tears, and make my moan!
Where'er I am, where'er I move,
I meet the object of my love.

4 Insatiate to this spring I fly;
I drink, and yet am ever dry;
Ah! who against thy charms is proof?
Ah, who that loves can love enough?

321     The Solid Rock. L.M.

_The Sure Foundation._

My hope is built on nothing less
  Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
  But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

Cho.--On Christ, the Solid Rock, I stand,
      All other ground is sinking sand.

2 When darkness veils his lovely face,
  I rest on his unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
  My anchor holds within the vail.

3 His oath, his covenant, his blood,
  Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
  He then is all my hope and stay.

4 When he shall come with trumpet sound.
  O, may I then in him be found;
Dressed in his righteousness alone,
  Faultless to stand before the throne.

     Rev. Edward Mote, 1825.


322     How Can I but Love Him? 6s & 5s.

_The Exceeding Love of Christ._

So tender, so precious.
  My Savior to me;
So true, and so gracious,
  I've found him to be.

Ref.--How can I but love him?
        But love him, but love him?
      There's no friend above him,
        Poor sinner, for thee.

2 So patient, so kindly
  Toward all of my ways;
I blunder so blindly,
  He love still repays.

3 Of all friends the fairest
  And truest is he;
His love is the rarest,
  That ever can be.

4 His beauty, tho' bleeding
  And circled with thorns,
Is then most exceeding;
  For grief him adorns.

     J.E. Rankin, D.D.


323     My Beloved, 11s & 8s.

_My Beloved._

O thou, in whose presence my soul takes delight,
  On whom in affliction I call;
My comfort by day, and my song in the night,
  My hope, my salvation, my all.

2 Where dost thou at noon-tide resort with thy sheep,
  To feed in the pastures of love?
And why in the valley of death should I weep,
  Or alone in the wilderness rove?

3 O, why should I wander an alien from thee,
  Or cry in the desert for bread?
Thy foes will rejoice when my sorrows they see,
  And smile at the tears I have shed.

4 He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,
  And myriads wait for his word;
He speaks, and eternity, fill'd with his voice,
  Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.

_The Presence of Christ Desired._

How tedious and tasteless the hours
  When Jesus no longer I see!
Sweet prospects, sweet birds, and sweet flowers
  Have lost all their sweetness to me:
The midsummer sun shines but dim;
  The fields strive in vain to look gay;
But when I am happy in him,
  December's as pleasant as May.

2 His name yields the richest perfume,
  And sweeter than music his voice;
His presence disperses my gloom,
  And makes all within me rejoice:
I should, were he always so nigh,
  Have nothing to wish or to fear;
No mortal so happy as I;
  My summer would last all the year.

3 Content with beholding his face,
  My all to his pleasure resigned,
No changes of season or place
  Would make any change in my mind:
While blest with a sense of his love,
  A palace a toy would appear;
And prisons would palaces prove,
  If Jesus would dwell with me there.

4 Dear Lord, if indeed I am thine,
  If thou art my sun and my song,
Say, why do I languish and pine?
  And why are my winters so long?
O, drive these dark clouds from my sky;
  Thy soul-cheering presence restore;
Or take me unto thee on high,
  Where winter and clouds are no more.

     John Newton.


325     De Fleury. 8s. D

_Phil. 1:23._     (571)

My Savior, whom absent I love,
  Whom, not having seen, I adore
Whose name is exalted above
  All glory, dominion, and power,--
Dissolve thou these bands that detain
  My soul from her portion in thee;
Ah! strike off this adamant chain,
  And make me eternally free!

2 When that happy era begins,
  When arrayed in thy glories I shine,
Nor grieve any more, by my sins,
  The bosom on which I recline,
Oh! then shall the veil be removed,
  And round me thy brightness be poured!
I shall meet him, whom absent I loved,
  I shall see, whom unseen I adored.

3 And then, nevermore shall the fears,
  The trials, temptations, and woes,
Which darken this valley of tears,
  Intrude on my blissful repose;
To Jesus, the crown of my hope,
  My soul is in haste to be gone;
Oh! bear me, ye cherubim, up,
  And waft me away to his throne!

     W. Cowper.


326     I Need Thee Every Hour. P.M.

_Need of Christ._

I need thee ev'ry hour,
  Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like thine
  Can peace afford.

Cho.--I need thee, oh, I need thee,
      Ev'ry hour I need thee;
      Oh, bless me now, my Savior
      I come to thee.

2 I need thee ev'ry hour;
  Stay thou near by;
Temptations lose their power
  When thou art nigh.

3 I need thee ev'ry hour,
  In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
  Or life is vain.

4 I need thee ev'ry hour;
  Teach me thy will;
And thy rich promises
  In me fulfill.

5 I need thee ev'ry hour,
  Most Holy One;
Oh, make me thine indeed,
  Thou blessed Son.

     Annie S. Hawks.

_Altogether Lovely._     (572)

My gracious Redeemer I love,
  His praises aloud I'll proclaim:
And join with the armies above,
  To shout his adorable name.
To gaze on his glories divine
  Shall be my eternal employ;
To see them incessantly shine,
  My boundless, ineffable joy.

2 He freely redeemed with his blood
  My soul from the confines of hell,
To live on the smiles of my God,
  And in his sweet presence to dwell:--
To shine with the angels in light,
  With saints and with seraphs to sing,
To view, with eternal delight,
  My Jesus, my Savior, my King!

     B. Francis.
