1   Ye Christian heralds,--go, proclaim
    Salvation in Immanuel's name:
    To distant climes the tidings bear,
    And plant the rose of Sharon there.

2   He'll shield you with a wall of fire,
    With holy zeal your hearts inspire,
    Bid raging winds their fury cease,
    And calm the savage breast to peace.

3   And when our labors all are o'er,
    Then shall we meet to part no more,--
    Meet, with the ransomed throng to fail,
    And crown the Saviour Lord of all.

Prayer for Children.


1   God of mercy, hear our prayer
      For the children thou hast given;
    Let them all thy blessings share--
      Grace on earth and bliss in heaven.

2   In the morning of their days
      May their hearts be drawn to thee;
    Let them learn to lisp thy praise
      In their earliest infancy.

3   When we see their passions rise,
      Sinful habits unsubdued,
    Then to thee we lift our eyes,
      That their hearts may be renewed.

4   For this mercy, Lord, we cry;
      Bend thine ever-gracious ear;
    While on thee our souls rely,
      Hear our prayer--in mercy hear.

1   By cool Siloam's shady rill
      How sweet the lily grows!
    How sweet the breath beneath the hill

2   Lo, such the child whose early feet
      The paths of peace have trod;
    Whose secret heart, with influence sweet,
      Is upward drawn to God!

3   By cool Siloam's shady rill
      The lily must decay;
    The rose that blooms beneath the hill
      Must shortly fade away.

4   And soon, too soon, the wintry hour
      Of man's maturer age
    Will shake the soul with sorrow's power,
      And stormy passion's rage!

      We seek thy grace alone,
    In childhood, manhood, age, and death;
      To keep us still thine own!

    While life is all before thee,

Early Piety.


1   When children give their hearts to God,
      'Tis pleasing in his eyes;
    A flower, when offered in the bud,
      Is no vain sacrifice.

2   It saves us from a thousand snares
      To mind religion young;
    Grace will preserve our following years,
      And make our virtues strong.

3   To thee, Almighty God, to thee
      May we our hearts resign;
    'Twill please us to look back and see,
      That our whole lives were thine.

1   In the soft season of thy youth,
      In Nature's smiling bloom,
    Ere age arrive, and trembling wait
      Its summons to the tomb;

2   Remember thy Creator, God;
      For him thy powers employ;
    Make him thy fear, thy love, thy hope,
      Thy confidence, thy joy.

3   He shall defend and guide thy course
      Through life's uncertain sea,
    Till thou art landed on the shore
      Of blessed eternity.

4   Then seek the Lord betimes, and choose
      The path of heavenly truth:
    The earth affords no lovelier sight
      Than a religious youth.

Permanence of Early Religious Impressions.


1   While yet the youthful spirit bears
      The image of its God within,
    And uneffaced that beauty wears
      So soon to be destroyed by sin;--

2   Then is the time for faith and love
      To take in charge their precious care,
    Teach the young eye to look above,
      Teach the young knee to bend in prayer.

3   The world will come with care and crime,
      And tempt too many a heart astray;
    Still the seed sown in early time
      Will not be wholly cast away.

4   The infant prayer, the infant hymn,
      Within the darkened soul will rise,
    When age's weary eye is dim,
      And the grave's shadow round us lies.

5   Lord, grant our hearts be so inclined,
      Thy work to seek, thy will to do;
    And while we teach the youthful mind,
      Our own be taught thy lessons too.

Importance of the Bible to the Young.


1   How shall the young secure their hearts,
      And guard their lives, from sin?
    Thy word the choicest rules imparts
      To keep the conscience clean.

2   'Tis, like the sun, a heavenly light,
      That guides us all the day,
    And, through the dangers of the night,
      A lamp to lead our way.

3   Thy precepts make us truly wise;
      We hate the sinner's road:
    We hate our own vain thoughts that rise,
      But love thy law, O God!

4   Thy word is everlasting truth:
      How pure is every page!
    That holy book shall guide our youth,
      And well support our age.

Youth and the Spring-time.


1     Sweet is the time of spring,
      When nature's charms appear;
    The birds with ceaseless pleasure sing,
      And hail the opening year:
      But sweeter far the spring
      Of wisdom and of grace,
    When children bless and praise their King,
      Who loves the youthful race.

2     Sweet is the dawn of day,
      When light just streaks the sky;
    When shades and darkness pass away,
      And morning's beams are nigh:
      But sweeter far the dawn
      Of piety in youth;
    When doubt and darkness are withdrawn,
      Before the light of truth.

3     Sweet is the early dew,
      Which gilds the mountain tops,
    And decks each plant and flower we view,
      With pearly, glittering drops;
      But sweeter far the scene
      On Zion's holy hill,
    When there the dew of youth is seen
      Its freshness to distil.

1   In the glad morn of life, when youth
      With generous ardor glows,
    And shines in all the fairest charms
      That beauty can disclose;

2   Deep on thy soul,--before its powers
      Are yet by vice enslaved,--
    Be thy Creator's lofty name
      And character engraved.

3   For soon the shades of grief may cloud
      The sunshine of thy days;
    And cares and toils, an endless round,
      Encompass all thy ways.

4   True wisdom, early sought and gained,
      In age will give thee rest;
    O then, improve the morn of life,
      To make its evening blest!

      Teaching lessons from on high.

2   Here, beneath thy wing, we seat us,
      Up to heaven for wisdom look;
    Lord, in mercy deign to meet us,--
      Meet us in thy sacred book.

3   Since thy truth doth gild its pages,
      May that truth, Lord, make us free;
    On the Rock of endless ages
      Let our faith established be.

4   To our faith we'll add the graces,
      Virtue, knowledge, patience, love;
    When on earth we leave our places,
      Raise us all to seats above.

Opening of the School.

      In this house of God again;
    Constant friends have led us hither,
      Here to chant the solemn strain,
    Here to breathe our adoration,
      Here the Saviour's praise to sing:
    May the Spirit of salvation
      Come with healing in his wing.

2   We have met, and Time is flying;
      We shall part, and still his wing,
    Sweeping o'er the dead and dying,
      Will the changeful seasons bring:
    Let us, while our hearts are lightest,
      In our fresh and early years,
    Turn to Him whose smile is brightest,
      And whose grace will calm our fears.

3   He will aid us, should existence
      With its sorrows sting the breast;
    Gleaming in the onward distance,
      Faith will mark the land of rest:
    There, 'midst day-beams round him playing,
      We our Father's face shall see,
    And shall hear him gently saying,
      "Little children, come to me."

      So small a drop as I
    Can ne'er refresh these thirsty fields,
      I'll tarry in the sky?

2   What if a shining beam of noon
      Should in its fountain stay,
    Because its feeble light alone
      Cannot create a day?

3   Doth not each rain-drop help to form
      The cool, refreshing shower,
    And every ray of light to warm
      And beautify the flower?

4   Go thou, and strive to do thy share--
      One talent,--less than thine,--
    Improved with steady zeal and care,
      Would gain rewards divine.

    Not twice the same assembly here
      Have hailed the children's festal day.

      Some in our number marked to fall:
    Be young and old prepared alike;

    More humble, docile, faithful, true,
      More like thy Son, from race to race.

1   When, his salvation bringing,
      To Zion Jesus came,
    The children all stood singing
      Hosanna to his name.
    Nor did their zeal offend him,
      But, as he rode along,
    He bade them still attend him,
      And smiled to hear their song.

2   And since the Lord retaineth
      His love for children still,
    Though now as king he reigneth
      On Zion's heavenly hill,
    We'll flock around his banner,
      Who sits upon the throne;
    And cry aloud, "Hosanna
      To David's royal Son."

3   For should we fail proclaiming
      Our great Redeemer's praise,
    The stones, our silence shaming,
      Might well hosanna raise.
    But shall we only render
      The tribute of our words?
    No! while our hearts are tender,
      They, too, shall be the Lord's.

    Spread o'er nature's ample face,
      Flows thy goodness unconfined.
    Musing in the silent grove,
      Or the busy walks of men,
    Still we trace thy wondrous love,
      Claiming large returns again.

2   Lord, what offering shall we bring,
      At thine altars when we bow?
    Hearts, the pure unsullied spring
      Whence the kind affections flow;
    Soft compassion's feeling soul,
      By the melting eye expressed;
    Sympathy, at whose control
      Sorrow leaves the wounded breast;

3   Willing hands to lead the blind,
      Bind the wounded, feed the poor;
    Love, embracing all our kind;
      Charity, with liberal store:--
    Teach us, O thou heavenly King,
      Thus to show our grateful mind,
    Thus the accepted offering bring,
      Love to thee and all mankind.

Kindness to the Poor.


1   How blest is he who fears the Lord,
      And follows his commands,
    Who lends the poor without reward,
      Or gives with liberal hands.

2   As pity dwells within his breast
      To all the sons of need,
    So God shall answer his request
      With blessings on his seed.

3   In times of danger and distress,
      Some beams of light shall shine,
    To show the world his righteousness,
      And give him peace divine.

4   His works of piety and love
      Remain before the Lord;
    Sweet peace on earth, and joys above,
      Shall be his sure reward.




766.              C. M.              H. Martineau.

All Men are equal.


1   All men are equal in their birth,
      Heirs of the earth and skies;
    All men are equal when that earth
      Fades from their dying eyes.

2   God meets the throngs who pay their vows
      In courts that hands have made,
    And hears the worshipper who bows
      Beneath the plantain shade.

3   'Tis man alone who difference sees,
      And speaks of high and low,
    And worships those, and tramples these,
      While the same path they go.

4   O, let man hasten to restore
      To all their rights of love;
    In power and wealth exult no more;
      In wisdom lowly move.

5   Ye great, renounce your earth-born pride,
      Ye low, your shame and fear:
    Live, as ye worship, side by side;
      Your brotherhood revere.




767.              C. M.             Lutheran Coll.

Charity.


1   Go to the pillow of disease,
      Where night gives no repose,
    And on the cheek where sickness preys,
      Bid health to plant the rose.

2   Go where the friendless stranger lies;
      To perish is his doom:
    Snatch from the grave his closing eyes.
      And bring his blessing home.

3   Thus what our Heavenly Father gave
      Shall we as freely give;
    Thus copy him who lived to save,
      And died that we might live.

"Ye are the Salt of the Earth."


1   Salt of the earth! ye virtuous few
      Who season human kind;
    Light of the world! whose cheering ray
      Illumes the realms of mind.

2   Where misery spreads her deepest shade
      Your strong compassion glows;
    From your blest lips the balm proceeds
      That softens human woes.

3   Yours is the large expansive thought,
      The high heroic deed;
    Exile and chains to you are dear,
      To you 'tis sweet to bleed.

4   Proceed! your race of glory run,
      Your virtuous toils endure;
    You come commissioned from on high,
      And your reward is sure.




769.              L. M.                     Watts.

All Things vain without Love.


1   Had I the tongues of Greeks and Jews,
    And nobler speech than angels use,
    If love be absent, I am found
    Like tinkling brass, an empty sound.

2   Were I inspired to preach and tell
    All that is done in heaven and hell;
    Or could my faith the world remove,
    Still I am nothing without love.

3   Should I distribute all my store
    To feed the cravings of the poor;
    Or give my body to the flame
    To gain a martyr's glorious name;

4   If love to God and love to men
    Be absent, all my hopes are vain:
    Nor tongues, nor gifts, nor fiery zeal,
    The works of love can e'er fulfil.




770.              C. M.            Mrs. Sigourney.

The Sower and the Seed.


1   All hail! ye servants of the Lord!
      On mercy's mission bound;
    Who, like the sower of the word,
      Strew precious gifts around.

2   What though your seed 'mid thorns be sown,
      Where tares and brambles thrive,
    Still One is able, One alone,
      To save its germ alive.

3   Ye fear, what falls on stony earth
      Will mock your prayerful toil;
    But sometimes plants of holiest birth
      Bear fruit in sterile soil.

4   The seed that by the way-side fell,
      Perchance you counted dead;
    Yet birds, that sing in heaven, may tell,
      They on its sweetness fed.

5   And some a hundred fold shall bear,
      To glorify the Lord;
    How blessed, then, will be your care!
      How glorious your reward!

The Sower and his Sheaves.


1   He, that goeth forth with weeping,
      Bearing still the precious seed,
    Never tiring, never sleeping,
      Soon shall see his toil succeed:
    Showers of rain will fall from heaven,
      Then the cheering sun will shine,
    So shall plenteous fruit be given,
      Through an influence all divine.

2   Sow thy seed, be never weary,
      Let not fear thy mind employ;
    Though the prospect be most dreary,
      Thou may'st reap the fruits of joy:
    Lo! the scene of verdure bright'ning,
      See the rising grain appear;
    Look again! the fields are whit'ning,
      Harvest-time is surely near.




772.              S. M.                Montgomery.

Active Effort to do Good.


1     Sow in the morn thy seed;
      At eve hold not thy hand;
    To doubt and fear give thou no heed;
      Broadcast it o'er the land;--

2     And duly shall appear,
      In verdure, beauty, strength,
    The tender blade, the stalk, the ear,
      And the full corn at length.

3     Thou canst not toil in vain;
      Cold, heat, and moist, and dry,
    Shall foster and mature the grain
      For garners in the sky.




773.              L. M.                  Drummond.

Faith without Works is Dead.


1   As body when the soul has fled,
    As barren trees, decayed and dead,
    Is faith; a hopeless, lifeless thing,
    If not of righteous deeds the spring.

2   One cup of healing oil and wine,
    One tear-drop shed on mercy's shrine,
