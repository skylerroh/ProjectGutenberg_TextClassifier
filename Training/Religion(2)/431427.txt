tutes or ever has constituted laws to that effect, is a mor-
tal error, a human conception opposed to the divine [15]
government. Mind and matter mingling in perpetual
warfare is a kingdom divided against itself, that shall be
brought to desolation. The final destruction of this
false belief in matter will appear at the full revelation
of Spirit,--one God, and the brotherhood of man. [20]
Organic life is an error of statement that Truth destroys.
The Science of Life needs only to be understood; its dem-
onstration proves the correctness of my statements, and
brings blessings infinite.

_Why did God command, __"__Be fruitful, and multiply,_ [25]
_and replenish the earth,__"__ if all minds (men) have existed_
_from the beginning, and have had successive stages of_
_existence to the present time?_

Your question implies that Spirit, which first spirit-
ually created the universe, including man, created man [30]

[Page 57.]

over again materially; and, by the aid of mankind, all [1]
was later made which _He had made_. If the first record
is true, what evidence have you--apart from the evi-
dence of that which you admit cannot discern spiritual
things--of any other creation? The creative "Us" [5]
made all, and Mind was the creator. Man originated
not from dust, materially, but from Spirit, spiritually.
This work had been done; the true creation was finished,
and its spiritual Science is alluded to in the first chapter
of Genesis. [10]

Jesus said of error, "That thou doest, do quickly."
By the law of opposites, after the truth of man had been
demonstrated, the postulate of error must appear. That
this addendum was untrue, is seen when Truth, God,
denounced it, and said: "I will greatly multiply thy [15]
sorrow." "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
surely die." The opposite error said, "I am true," and
declared, "God doth know ... that your eyes shall be
opened, and ye shall be as gods," creators. This was false;
and the Lord God never said it. This history of a falsity [20]
must be told in the name of Truth, or it would have no
seeming. The Science of creation is the universe with man
created spiritually. The false sense and error of creation
is the sense of man and the universe created materially.

_Why does the record make man a creation of the sixth_ [25]
_and last day, if he was coexistent with God?_

In its genesis, the Science of creation is stated in mathe-
matical order, beginning with the lowest form and ascend-
ing the scale of being up to man. But all that really is,
always was and forever is; for it existed in and of the Mind [30]
that is God, wherein man is foremost.

[Page 58.]

_If one has died of consumption, and he has no remem-_ [1]
_brance of that disease or dream, does that disease have any_
_more power over him?_

Waking from a dream, one learns its _unreality_; then
it has no power over one. Waking from the dream of [5]
death, proves to him who thought he died that it was a
dream, and that he did not die; then he learns that con-
sumption did not kill him. When the belief in the power
of disease is destroyed, disease cannot return.

_How does Mrs. Eddy know that she has read and studied_ [10]
_correctly, if one must deny the evidences of the senses?_
_She had to use her eyes to read._

Jesus said, "Having eyes, see ye not?" I read the in-
spired page through a higher than mortal sense. As
matter, the eye cannot see; and as mortal mind, it is a [15]
belief that sees. I may read the Scriptures through a
belief of eyesight; but I must spiritually understand
them to interpret their Science.

_Does the theology of Christian Science aid its heal-_
_ing?_ [20]

Without its theology there is no mental science, no
order that proceeds from God. All Science is divine,
not human, in origin and demonstration. If God does
not govern the action of man, it is inharmonious: if He
does govern it, the action is Science. Take away the [25]
theology of mental healing and you take away its science,
leaving it a human "mind-cure," nothing more nor less,
--even one human mind governing another; by which,
if you agree that God is Mind, you admit that there is

[Page 59.]

more than one government and God. Having no true [1]
sense of the healing theology of Mind, you can neither
understand nor demonstrate its Science, and will prac-
tise your belief of it in the name of Truth. This is the
mortal "mind-cure" that produces the effect of mes- [5]
merism. It is using the power of human will, instead
of the divine power understood, as in Christian Science;
and without this Science there had better be no "mind-
cure,"--in which the last state of patients is worse than
the first. [10]

_Is it wrong to pray for the recovery of the sick?_

Not if we pray Scripturally, with the understanding
that God _has_ given all things to those who love Him;
but pleading with infinite Love to love us, or to restore
health and harmony, and then to admit that it has been [15]
lost under His government, is the prayer of doubt and
mortal belief that is unavailing in divine Science.

_Is not all argument mind over mind?_

The Scriptures refer to God as saying, "Come now, and
let us reason together." There is but one right Mind, and [20]
that one should and does govern man. Any copartnership
with that Mind is impossible; and the only benefit in
speaking often one to another, arises from the success that
one individual has with another in leading his thoughts
away from the human mind or body, and guiding them [25]
with Truth. That individual is the best healer who as-
serts himself the least, and thus becomes a transparency
for the divine Mind, who is the only physician; the divine
Mind is the scientific healer.

[Page 60.]

_How can you believe there is no sin, and that God does_ [1]
_not recognize any, when He sent His Son to save from_
_sin, and the Bible is addressed to sinners? How can you_
_believe there is no sickness, when Jesus came healing the_
_sick? [5]_

To regard sin, disease, and death with less deference,
and only as the woeful unrealities of being, is the only
way to destroy them; Christian Science is proving this by
healing cases of disease and sin after all other means have
failed. The Nazarene Prophet could make the unreality [10]
of both apparent in a moment.

_Does it not limit the power of Mind to deny the possi-_
_bility of communion with departed friends--dead only in_
_belief?_

Does it limit the power of Mind to say that addition [15]
is not subtraction in mathematics? The Science of Mind
reveals the impossibility of two individual sleepers, in
different phases of thought, communicating, even if touch-
ing each other corporeally; or for one who sleeps to
communicate with another who is awake. Mind's possi- [20]
bilities are not lessened by being confined and conformed
to the Science of being.

_If mortal mind and body are myths, what is the con-_
_nection between them and real identity, and why are there_
_as many identities as mortal bodies?_ [25]

Evil in the beginning claimed the power, wisdom, and
utility of good; and every creation or idea of Spirit has
its counterfeit in some matter belief. Every material be-
lief hints the existence of spiritual reality; and if mortals
are instructed in spiritual things, it will be seen that ma- [30]

[Page 61.]

terial belief, in all its manifestations, reversed, will be [1]
found the type and representative of verities priceless,
eternal, and just at hand.

The education of the future will be instruction, in spir-
itual Science, against the material symbolic counterfeit [5]
sciences. All the knowledge and vain strivings of mortal
mind, that lead to death,--even when aping the wisdom
and magnitude of immortal Mind,--will be swallowed
up by the reality and omnipotence of Truth over error,
and of Life over death. [10]

"_Dear Mrs. Eddy_:--In the October _Journal_ I read
the following: "But the real man, who was created in the
image of God, does not commit sin." _What then does sin?_
_What commits theft? Or who does murder?_ For instance,
the man is held responsible for the crime; for I went once [15]
to a place where a man was said to be "hanged for mur-
der"--and certainly I saw him, or his effigy, dangling
at the end of a rope. This "man" was held responsible
for the 'sin.' "

_What sins?_ [20]

According to the Word, man is the image and likeness
of God. Does God's essential likeness sin, or dangle at
the end of a rope? If not, what does? A culprit, a sinner,
--anything but a man! Then, what is a sinner? A
mortal; but man is _immortal_. [25]

Again: mortals are the embodiments (or bodies, if
you please) of error, not of Truth; of sickness, sin, and
death. Naming these His embodiment, can neither make
them so nor overthrow the logic that man is God's like-
ness. Mortals seem very material; man in the likeness [30]

[Page 62.]

of Spirit is spiritual. Holding the _right_ idea of man in my [1]
mind, I can improve my own, and other people's individ-
uality, health, and morals; whereas, the opposite image
of man, a sinner, kept constantly in mind, can no more
improve health or morals, than holding in thought the [5]
form of a boa-constrictor can aid an artist in painting a
landscape.

Man is seen only in the true likeness of his Maker.
Believing a lie veils the truth from our vision; even as
in mathematics, in summing up positive and negative [10]
quantities, the negative quantity offsets an equal positive
quantity, making the aggregate positive, or true quantity,
by that much, less available.

_Why do Christian Scientists hold that their theology is_
_essential to heal the sick, when the mind-cure claims to heal_ [15]
_without it?_

The theology of Christian Science is Truth; opposed
to which is the error of sickness, sin, and death, that
Truth destroys.

A "mind-cure" is a matter-cure. An adherent to this [20]
method honestly acknowledges this fact in her work
entitled "Mind-cure on a Material Basis." In that
work the author grapples with Christian Science, attempts
to solve its divine Principle by the rule of human mind,
fails, and ends in a parody on this Science which is amus- [25]
ing to astute readers,--especially when she tells them
that she is practising this Science.

The theology of Christian Science is based on the action
of the divine Mind over the human mind and body;
whereas, "mind-cure" rests on the notion that the human [30]
mind can cure its own disease, or that which it causes,

[Page 63.]

and the _sickness of matter_,--which is infidel in the one [1]
case, and anomalous in the other. It was said of old by
Truth-traducers, that Jesus healed through Beelzebub;
but the claim that one erring mind cures another one was
at first gotten up to hinder his benign influence and to hide [5]
his divine power.

Our Master understood that Life, Truth, Love are the
triune Principle of all pure theology; also, that this divine
trinity is one infinite remedy for the opposite triad, sick-
ness, sin, and death. [10]

_If there is no sin, why did Jesus come to save sinners?_

If there is no reality in sickness, why does a Chris-
tian Scientist go to the bedside and address himself to
the healing of disease, on the basis of its unreality?
Jesus came to seek and to save such as believe in the [15]
reality of the unreal; to save them from _this false belief_;
that they might lay hold of eternal Life, the great reality
that concerns man, and understand the final fact,--that
God is omnipotent and omnipresent; yea, "that the Lord
He is God; there is none else beside Him," as the Scrip- [20]
tures declare.

_If Christ was God, why did Jesus cry out, __"__My God,_
_why hast Thou forsaken me?__"_

Even as the struggling heart, reaching toward a higher
goal, appeals to its hope and faith, Why failest thou [25]
me? Jesus as the son of man was human: Christ as
the Son of God was divine. This divinity was reaching
humanity through the crucifixion of the human,--that
momentous demonstration of God, in which Spirit proved
its supremacy over matter. Jesus assumed for mortals the [30]

[Page 64.]

weakness of flesh, that Spirit might be found "All-in-all." [1]
Hence, the human cry which voiced that struggle;
thence, the way he made for mortals' escape. Our
Master bore the cross to show his power over death;
then relinquished his earth-task of teaching and dem- [5]
onstrating the nothingness of sickness, sin, and death,
and rose to his native estate, man's indestructible eternal
life in God.

_What can prospective students of the College take for_
_preliminary studies? Do you regard the study of litera-_ [10]
_ture and languages as objectionable?_

Persons contemplating a course at the Massachusetts
Metaphysical College, can prepare for it through no
books except the Bible, and "Science and Health with
Key to the Scriptures." Man-made theories are nar- [15]
row, else extravagant, and are always materialistic.
The ethics which guide thought spiritually must bene-
fit every one; for the only philosophy and religion that
afford instruction are those which deal with facts and
resist speculative opinions and fables. [20]

Works on science are profitable; for science is not
human. It is spiritual, and not material. Literature
and languages, to a limited extent, are aids to a student
of the Bible and of Christian Science.

_Is it possible to know why we are put into this condition_ [25]
_of mortality?_

It is quite as possible to know wherefore man is thus
conditioned, as to be certain that he _is_ in a state of
mortality. The only evidence of the existence of a mor-
tal man, or of a material state and universe, is gathered [30]

[Page 65.]

from the five personal senses. This delusive evidence, [1]
Science has dethroned by repeated proofs of its falsity.

We have no more proof of human discord,--sin,
sickness, disease, or death,--than we have that the
earth's surface is flat, and her motions imaginary. If [5]
man's _ipse dixit_ as to the stellar system is correct, this
is because Science is true, and the evidence of the senses
is false. Then why not submit to the affirmations of
Science concerning the greater subject of human weal
and woe? Every question between Truth and error, [10]
Science must and will decide. Left to the decision of
Science, your query concerns a negative which the posi-
tive Truth destroys; for God's universe and man are
immortal. We must not consider the false side of exist-
ence in order to gain the true solution of Life and its [15]
great realities.

_Have you changed your instructions as to the right way_
_of treating disease?_

I have not; and this important fact must be, and al-
ready is, apprehended by those who understand my in- [20]
structions on this question. Christian Science demands
both law and gospel, in order to demonstrate healing,
and I have taught them both in its demonstration, and
with signs following. They are a unit in restoring the
equipoise of mind and body, and balancing man's ac- [25]
count with his Maker. The sequence proves that strict
adherence to one is inadequate to compensate for the
absence of the other, since both constitute the divine law
of healing.

The Jewish religion demands that "whoso sheddeth [30]
man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed." But this

[Page 66.]

law is not infallible in wisdom; and obedience thereto [1]
may be found faulty, since false testimony or mistaken
evidence may cause the innocent to suffer for the guilty.
Hence the gospel that fulfils the law in righteousness,
the genius whereof is displayed in the surprising wisdom [5]
of these words of the New Testament: "Whatsoever
a man soweth, that shall he also reap." No possible
injustice lurks in this mandate, and no human mis-
judgment can pervert it; for the offender alone suffers,
and always according to divine decree. This sacred, [10]
solid precept is verified in all directions in Mind-
healing, and is supported in the Scripture by parallel
proof.

The law and gospel of Truth and Love teach, through
divine Science, that sin is identical with suffering, and [15]
that suffering is the lighter affliction. To reach the sum-
mit of Science, whence to discern God's perfect ways
and means, the material sense must be controlled by
the higher spiritual sense, and Truth be enthroned,
while "we look not at the things which are seen, but at [20]
the things which are not seen."

Cynical critics misjudge my meaning as to the sci-
entific treatment of the sick. Disease that is superin-
duced by sin is not healed like the more physical
ailment. The beginner in sin-healing must know this, or [25]
he never can reach the Science of Mind-healing, and
so "overcome evil with good." Error in premise is met
with error in practice; yea, it is "the blind leading the
blind." Ignorance of the cause of disease can neither
remove that cause nor its effect. [30]

I endeavor to accommodate my instructions to the
present capability of the learner, and to support the

[Page 67.]

liberated thought until its altitude reaches beyond the [1]
mere alphabet of Mind-healing. Above physical wants,
lie the higher claims of the law and gospel of healing.
First is the law, which saith:--

"Thou shalt not commit adultery;" in other words, [5]
thou shalt not adulterate Life, Truth, or Love,--men-
tally, morally, or physically. "Thou shalt not steal;"
that is, thou shalt not rob man of money, which is but
trash, compared with his rights of mind and character.
"Thou shalt not kill;" that is, thou shalt not strike at the [10]
eternal sense of Life with a malicious aim, but shalt
know that by doing thus thine own sense of Life shall be
forfeited. "Thou shalt not bear false witness;" that is,
thou shalt not utter a lie, either mentally or audibly, nor
cause it to be thought. Obedience to these command- [15]
ments is indispensable to health, happiness, and length
of days.

The gospel of healing demonstrates the law of Love.
Justice uncovers sin of every sort; and mercy demands
that if you see the danger menacing others, you shall, [20]
_Deo volente_, inform them thereof. Only thus is the right
practice of Mind-healing achieved, and the wrong prac-
tice discerned, disarmed, and destroyed.

_Do you believe in translation?_

If your question refers to language, whereby one ex- [25]
presses the sense of words in one language by equiva-
lent words in another, I do. If you refer to the removal
of a person to heaven, without his subjection to death,
I modify my affirmative answer. I believe in this
removal being possible after all the footsteps requisite [30]
have been taken up to the very throne, up to the

[Page 68.]

spiritual sense and fact of divine substance, intelligence, [1]
Life, and Love. This translation is not the work of mo-
ments; it requires both time and eternity. It means more
than mere disappearance to the human sense; it must
include also man's changed appearance and diviner form [5]
visible to those beholding him here.

_The Rev. ---- said in a sermon: A true Christian_
_would protest against metaphysical healing being called_
_Christian Science. He also maintained that pain and_
_disease are not illusions but realities; and that it is not_ [10]
_Christian to believe they are illusions. Is this so?_

It is unchristian to believe that pain and sickness are
anything _but_ illusions. My proof of this is, that the
penalty for believing in their reality is the very pain and
disease. Jesus cast out a devil, and the dumb spake; [15]
hence it is right to know that the works of Satan are the
illusion and error which Truth casts out.

Does the gentleman above mentioned know the
meaning of divine metaphysics, or of metaphysical
theology? [20]

According to Webster, metaphysics is defined thus:
"The science of the conceptions and relations which are
necessary to thought and knowledge; science of the
mind." Worcester defines it as "the philosophy of mind,
as distinguished from that of matter; a science of which [25]
the object is to explain the principles and causes of
all things existing," Brande calls metaphysics "the
science which regards the ultimate grounds of being, as
distinguished from its phenomenal modifications." "A
speculative science, which soars beyond the bounds of [30]
experience," is a further definition.

[Page 69.]

Divine metaphysics is that which treats of the exist- [1]
ence of God, His essence, relations, and attributes. A
sneer at metaphysics is a scoff at Deity; at His goodness,
mercy, and might.

Christian Science is the unfolding of true metaphysics; [5]
that is, of Mind, or God, and His attributes. Science rests
on Principle and demonstration. The Principle of Chris-
tian Science is divine. Its rule is, that man shall utilize
the divine power.

In Genesis i. 26, we read: "Let us make man in [10]
our image, after our likeness: and let them have
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
the air."

I was once called to visit a sick man to whom the
regular physicians had given three doses of Croton [15]
oil, and then had left him to die. Upon my arrival I
found him barely alive, and in terrible agony. In one
hour he was well, and the next day he attended to his
business. I removed the stoppage, healed him of en-
teritis, and neutralized the bad effects of the poison- [20]
ous oil. His physicians had failed even to move his
bowels,--though the wonder was, with the means
used in their effort to accomplish this result, that
they had not quite killed him. According to their
diagnosis, the exciting cause of the inflammation and [25]
stoppage was--eating smoked herring. The man is
living yet; and I will send his address to any one
who may wish to apply to him for information about
his case.

Now comes the question: Had that sick man dominion [30]
over the fish in his stomach?

His want of control over "the fish of the sea" must

[Page 70.]

have been an illusion, or else the Scriptures misstate [1]
man's power. That the Bible is true I believe, not
only, but I _demonstrated_ its truth when I exercised
my power over the fish, cast out the sick man's illu-
sion, and healed him. Thus it was shown that the [5]
healing action of Mind upon the body has its only ex-
planation in divine metaphysics. As a man "thinketh
in his heart, so is he." When the mortal thought, or be-
lief, was removed, the man was well.

_What did Jesus mean when he said to the dying thief,_ [10]
_"__To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise__"__?_

Paradisaical rest from physical agony would come to
the criminal, if the dream of dying should startle him
from the dream of suffering. The paradise of Spirit
would come to Jesus, in a spiritual sense of Life and [15]
power. Christ Jesus lived and reappeared. He was too
good to die; for goodness is immortal. The thief was
not equal to the demands of the hour; but sin was de-
stroying itself, and had already begun to die,--as
the poor thief's prayer for help indicated. The dy- [20]
ing malefactor and our Lord were inevitably sepa-
rated through Mind. The thief's body, as matter,
must dissolve into its native nothingness; whereas the
body of the holy Spirit of Jesus was eternal. That
day the thief would be with Jesus only in a finite [25]
and material sense of relief; while our Lord would
soon be rising to the supremacy of Spirit, working
out, even in the silent tomb, those wonderful demon-
strations of divine power, in which none could equal his
glory. [30]

[Page 71.]

_Is it right for me to treat others, when I am not entirely_ [1]
_well myself?_

The late John B. Gough is said to have suffered from
an appetite for alcoholic drink until his death; yet he
saved many a drunkard from this fatal appetite. Paul [5]
had a thorn in the flesh: one writer thinks that he was
troubled with rheumatism, and another that he had sore
eyes; but this is certain, that he healed others who were
sick. It is unquestionably right to do right; and heal-
ing the sick is a very right thing to do. [10]

_Does Christian Science set aside the law of transmission,_
_prenatal desires, and good or bad influences on the unborn_
_child?_

Science never averts law, but supports it. All actual
causation must interpret omnipotence, the all-knowing [15]
Mind. Law brings out Truth, not error; unfolds divine
Principle,--but neither human hypothesis nor matter.
Errors are based on a mortal or material formation; they
are suppositional modes, not the factors of divine presence
and power. [20]

Whatever is humanly conceived is a departure from
divine law; hence its mythical origin and certain end.
According to the Scriptures,--St. Paul declares astutely,
"For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all
things,"--man is incapable of originating; nothing can [25]
be formed apart from God, good, the all-knowing Mind.
What seems to be of human origin is the counterfeit
of the divine,--even human concepts, mortal shadows
flitting across the dial of time.

Whatever is real is right and eternal; hence the im- [30]
mutable and just law of Science, that God is good only,

[Page 72.]

and can transmit to man and the universe nothing evil, [1]
or unlike Himself. For the innocent babe to be born a
lifelong sufferer because of his parents' mistakes or sins,
were sore injustice. Science sets aside man as a creator,
and unfolds the eternal harmonies of the only living and [5]
true origin, God.

According to the beliefs of the flesh, both good and
bad traits of the parents are transmitted to their help-
less offspring, and God is supposed to impart to man
this fatal power. It is cause for rejoicing that this belief [10]
is as false as it is remorseless. The immutable Word
saith, through the prophet Ezekiel, "What mean ye, that
ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying,
The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's
teeth are set on edge? As I live, saith the Lord God, [15]
ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb
in Israel."

_Are material things real when they are harmonious, and_
_do they disappear only to the natural sense? Does this_
_Scripture, __"__Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have_ [20]
_need of all these things__"__ imply that Spirit takes note of_
_matter?_

The Science of Mind, as well as the material unii
verse, shows that nothing which is material is in
perpetual harmony. Matter is manifest mortal mind, [35]
