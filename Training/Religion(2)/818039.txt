Beginning at the junction of Falmouth street, and a forty-foot street
now called Caledonia street; thence running Southwest on said
Falmouth street one hundred and sixteen and eighty-eight hundredths
feet; thence Northwest at a right angle to a point where a line drawn
at right angles to said forty-foot street at a point thereon one
hundred and sixteen and fifty-five hundredths feet Northwest from
the point of beginning meets the said boundary at right angles to
Falmouth street, sixty-six and seventy-eight hundredths feet; thence
at an obtuse angle on said line at right angles to said forty-foot
street sixty-seven and thirty-five hundredths feet to said forty-foot

and sixteen and fifty-five hundredths feet to the point of beginning;
containing seven thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight square
feet more or less, and subject to the agreements and restrictions
mentioned in a deed recorded in Suffolk Registry of Deeds Lib. 1719,
Fol 83 so far as the same are now legally operative.

This deed of conveyance is made upon the following express trusts
and conditions which the said grantees by accepting this deed agree
and covenant for themselves and their successors in office to fully
perform and fulfil.

1. Said grantees shall be known as the "Christian Science Board of
Directors," and shall constitute a perpetual body or corporation
under and in accordance with section one, Chapter 39 of the Public
Statutes of Massachusetts.[5] Whenever a vacancy occurs in said
Board the remaining members shall within thirty days fill the same
by election; but no one shall be eligible to that office who is not
in the opinion of the remaining members of the Board a firm and
consistent believer in the doctrines of Christian Science as taught
in a book entitled "SCIENCE AND HEALTH," by Mary Baker G. Eddy
beginning with the seventy-first edition thereof.

[5] The deacons, church wardens, or other similar officers of
Churches or religious societies, and the trustees of the Methodist
Episcopal churches, appointed according to the discipline and usages
thereof, shall, if citizens of this commonwealth, be deemed bodies
corporate for the purpose of taking and holding in succession all
grants and donations, whether of real or personal estate, made either
to the and their successors, or to their respective churches, or to
the poor of their churches.

2. Said Board shall within five years from the date hereof build or
cause to be built upon said lot of land a suitable and convenient
church edifice, the cost of which shall not be less than fifty
thousand dollars.

3. When said church building is completed said Board shall elect a
pastor, reader or speaker to fill the pulpit who shall be a genuine
Christian Scientist; they shall maintain public worship in accordance
with the doctrines of Christian Science in said church, and for this
purpose they are fully empowered to make any and all necessary rules
and regulations.

4. Said Board of Directors shall not suffer or allow any building to
be erected upon said lot except a church building or edifice, nor
shall they allow said church building or any part thereof to be
used for any other purpose than for the ordinary and usual uses of
a church.

5. Said Board of Directors shall not allow or permit in said church
building any preaching or other religious services which shall not be
consonant and in strict harmony with the doctrines and practice of
Christian Science as taught and explained by Mary Baker G. Eddy in
the seventy-first edition of her book entitled "SCIENCE AND HEALTH,"
which is soon to be issued, and in any subsequent edition thereof.

6. The congregation which shall worship in said church shall be
styled "The First Church of Christ, Scientist."

7. Said Directors shall not sell or mortgage the land hereby
conveyed; but they shall see that all taxes and legal assessments
on said property are promptly paid.

8. Said church building shall not be removed from said lot except
for the purpose of rebuilding thereon a more expensive or a more
convenient structure in which said doctrines of Christian Science
only shall be preached and practised. If said church building is
removed for either of the purposes above set forth, any and all
tablets and inscriptions which are or shall be upon said church
building at the time of removal shall be removed therefrom and placed
upon the walls of the new edifice. If said building is burned, the
Directors shall forthwith proceed to rebuild the church.

9. Said Directors shall maintain regular preaching, reading or
speaking in said church on each Sabbath, and an omission to have
and maintain such preaching, reading or speaking for one year in
succession shall be deemed a breach of this condition.

10. Whenever said Directors shall determine that it is inexpedient to
maintain preaching, reading or speaking in said church in accordance
with the terms of this deed, they are authorized and required to
reconvey forthwith said lot of land with the building thereon to Mary
Baker G. Eddy, her heirs and assigns forever by a proper deed of
conveyance.

11. The omission or neglect on the part of said Directors to strictly
comply with any of the conditions herein contained shall constitute
a breach thereof, and the title hereby conveyed shall revert to the
grantor Mary Baker G. Eddy, her heirs and assigns forever, upon
her entry upon said land and taking possession thereof for such
breach.

To Have and to Hold the above granted premises with all the
privileges and appurtenances thereon belonging to said grantees and
their successors in office to the uses and trusts above described
forever.

And the said grantor for herself and her heirs, executors and
administrators covenants with the said grantees and their successors
in office that she is lawfully seized in fee simple of the aforesaid
premises, that they are free from all incumbrances not herein
mentioned or referred to, that she has good right to sell and convey
the same to the said grantees and their successors in office
as aforesaid, and that she will and her heirs, executors, and
administrators shall, warrant and defend the same to the said
grantees and their successors in office forever against the lawful
claims and demands of all persons.

In witness whereof I the said Mary Baker G. Eddy have hereto set
my hand and seal this 1st day of September, 1892.

1892, from Mary Baker G. Eddy, this property is conveyed on the

any Tenet or By-Law amended or annulled by the grantees unless
the written consent of said Mary Baker G. Eddy, the author of the
textbook "SCIENCE AND HEALTH WITH KEY TO THE SCRIPTURES," be given
therefor, or unless at the written request of Mrs. Eddy the Executive
Members of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, (formally called
the "First Members,") by a two-thirds vote of all their number,
decide so to do. And that the same inscription which is on the
outside of the present church edifice shall be placed on any new
church erected on said lot. And in consideration of one dollar to me
paid by said Ira O. Knapp, William B. Johnson, Joseph Armstrong and
Stephen A. Chase, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, I do
hereby confirm the deed as above mentioned, and do grant and release
