      Higher yet that star ascends.
    Traveller! blessedness and light,
      Peace and truth its course portends.
    Watchman! will its beams alone
      Gild the spot that gave them birth?
    Traveller! ages are its own;
      See, it bursts o'er all the earth.

3   Watchman! tell us of the night,
      For the morning seems to dawn.
    Traveller! darkness takes its flight;
      Doubt and terror are withdrawn.

4   Watchman! let thy wanderings cease;
      Hie thee to thy quiet home.
    Traveller! lo! the Prince of Peace,
      Lo! the Son of God, is come.

      Glory be to God most high!

3   "Peace on earth, good-will from heaven,
      Reaching far as man is found:
    Souls redeemed and sins forgiven:--

      Heaven and earth his praises sing!
    O, receive whom God appointed,
      For your Prophet, Priest and King."

Christmas Hymn.


1   Calm on the listening ear of night
      Come heaven's melodious strains,
    Where wild Judea stretches far
      Her silver-mantled plains!

2   The answering hills of Palestine
      Send back the glad reply;
    And greet, from all their holy heights,
      The dayspring from on high

3   O'er the blue depths of Galilee
      There comes a holier calm,
    And Sharon waves, in solemn praise,
      Her silent groves of palm.

4   "Glory to God!" the sounding skies
      Loud with their anthems ring,--
    Peace to the earth,--good-will to men,
      From heaven's eternal King!"

5   Light on thy hills, Jerusalem!
      The Saviour now is born!
    And bright on Bethlehem's joyous plains
      Breaks the first Christmas morn.

      What anthem do they sing?--
    The radiant clouds have backward rolled,
      And angels smite the string.
      "Glory to God!"--bright wings
      Spread glist'ning and afar,
    And on the hallowed rapture rings
      From circling star to star.

2     "Glory to God!" repeat
      The glad earth and the sea;
    And every wind and billow fleet,
      Bears on the jubilee.
      Where Hebrew bard hath sung,
      Or Hebrew seer hath trod,
    Each holy spot has found a tongue;
      "Let glory be to God."

3     Soft swells the music now
      Along that shining choir,
    And every seraph bends his brow
      And breathes above his lyre.
      What words of heavenly birth
      Thrill deep our hearts again,
    And fall like dew-drops to the earth?
      "Peace and good-will to men!"

4     Soft!--yet the soul is bound
      With rapture, like a chain:
    Earth, vocal, whispers them around,
      And heav'n repeats the strain.
      Sound, harps, and hail the morn
      With ev'ry golden string;--
    For unto us this day is born
      A Saviour and a King!

2     Not on a purple throne,
        With gold and jewels crowned,

      Low lies his head with the beasts of the stall;
    Angels bend o'er him, in slumber reclining,--
      Monarch, Redeemer, Restorer of all.

3   Say, shall we yield him in costly devotion,
      Odors of Edom, and offerings divine?
    Gems of the mountain, and pearls of the ocean,
      Myrrh from the forest, or gold from the mine?

4   Vainly we offer each ample oblation,
      Vainly with gold would his favor secure;
    Richer by far is the heart's adoration,
      Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.

    How soft the music of his tongue!
    How sweet the hallowed strains he sung!

2   Good-will henceforth to man be given,
      The light of glory beams on earth:
    Let angels tune the harps of heaven,
      And saints rejoice in Shiloh's birth;
    In him all nations shall be blest,
    And his shall be a glorious rest.

    To heal the sinner's wounded breast,
      To bind the broken heart,
    To spread the light of truth around,
    And to the world's remotest bound
      The heavenly gift impart.

3   He came our trembling souls to save
    From sin, from sorrow, and the grave,
      And chase our fears away;
    Victorious over death and time,
    To lead us to a happier clime,
      Where reigns eternal day.

2   On him the Spirit largely poured,
      Exerts its sacred fire;
    Wisdom and might, and zeal and love,
      His holy breast inspire.

3   He comes, from thickest films of vice
      To clear the mental ray;
    And on the eye-balls of the blind
      To pour celestial day.

4   He comes, the broken heart to bind,
      The bleeding soul to cure;
    And with the treasure of his grace
      Enrich the humble poor.

5   Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace!
      Thy welcome shall proclaim;
    And heaven's eternal arches ring

      Nor thorns infest the ground;
    He comes to make his blessings flow
      As far as sin is found.

    The glories of his righteousness,

    And heavenly wisdom showed to man
      In God his Father's name.

      That leads to bliss on high;
    Where all his faithful followers here

      Unveiling an immortal day.

3   "Come, wanderers, to my Father's home,
      Come, all ye weary ones, and rest!"
    Yes! sacred teacher,--we will come--

    Rejoicing in the strength that flows
    Through every nerve; and, free from pain,
    Pours forth to God the grateful strain.

3   The shattered mind his word restores,
    And tunes afresh the mental powers;
    The dead revive, to life return,
    And bid affection cease to mourn.

4   Canst thou, my soul, these wonders trace,
    And not admire Jehovah's grace?
    Canst thou behold thy Prophet's power,
    And not the God he served adore?

      And sunk into his sheltered nest;
    The wandering beast has sought his lair,
      And laid him down to welcome rest.

3   Still, near the lake, with weary tread,
      Lingers a form of human kind;
    And on his lone, unsheltered head,
      Flows the chill night-damp of the wind.

4   Why seeks he not a home of rest?
      Why seeks he not a pillowed bed?
    Beasts have their dens, the bird its nest;
      He hath not where to lay his head.

5   Such was the lot he freely chose,
      To bless, to save the human race;
    And through his poverty there flows
      A rich, full stream of heavenly grace.

    But One was there, who rose and said
      To the wild sea, "Be still!"

      Passed through the gloomy sky,
    The troubled billows knew their Lord,
      And sank beneath his eye.

      And tame the tempest's mood--
    Oh! send, thy Spirit forth in power
      O'er our dark souls to brood!

5   Thou that didst bow the billows' pride,
      Thy mandates to fulfil--
    Speak, speak to passion's raging tide,
      Speak and say--"Peace, be still!"

      Waiting to hear the rustling wing,

    With patience, and with hope endued
    Were seen the gathered multitude.

2   Had they who watched and waited there
      Been conscious who was passing by,
    With what unceasing anxious care
      Would they have sought his pitying eye;
    And craved with fervency of soul,
    His Power Divine to make them whole!

3   Bethesda's pool has lost its power!
      No angel, by his glad descent,
    Dispenses that diviner dower
      Which with its healing waters went.
    But he, whose word surpassed its wave,
    Is still omnipotent to save.

    Then, Saviour, would we think on thee;
    And, seated at the festal board,
    In fancy's eye behold the Lord.

3   Then may we seem, in fancy's ear,
    Thy manna-dropping tongue to hear,
    And think,--"if now his searching view
    Each secret of our spirit knew!"

    Beyond the bounds of earth endure;

2   Good-will to men, and zeal for God,
      His every thought engross;

      He goes to meet the cross.

      And woes to us unknown,
    Forth to the task his spirit flew;
      'Twas love that urged him on.

      Engage our wondering eyes,
    We learn our lighter cross to bear,
      And hasten to the skies.

    His weeping followers, gathering round,
      Receive his last commands.

2   "Blest is the man whose softening heart
      Feels all another's pain;
    To whom the supplicating eye
      Was never raised in vain;

3   "Peace from the bosom of his God,
      My peace to him I give;
    And when he kneels before his throne,
      His trembling soul shall live.

4   "To him protection shall be shown;
      And mercy from above
    Descend on those who thus fulfil
      The perfect law of love."

The Agony in Gethsemane.


1     He knelt; the Saviour knelt and prayed,
        When but his Father's eye
      Looked, through the lonely garden's shade,
        On that dread agony:
    The Lord of high and heavenly birth
    Was bowed with sorrow unto death.

2     He knew them all,--the doubt, the strife,
        The faint perplexing dread;
      The mists that hang o'er parting life
        All darkened round his head;
    And the Deliverer knelt to pray;
    Yet passed it not, that cup, away.

3     It passed not, though the stormy wave
        Had sunk beneath his tread;
      It passed not, though to him the grave
        Had yielded up its dead;
    But there was sent him, from on high,
    A gift of strength, for man to die.

4     And was his mortal hour beset
        With anguish and dismay?
      How may we meet our conflict yet
        In the dark, narrow way?
    How, but through him that path who trod?
    "Save, or we perish, Son of God."

Christ's Passion.


1   The morning dawns upon the place,
      Where Jesus spent the night in prayer;
    Through brightening glooms behold his face,
      No form or comeliness is there.

2   Last eve by those he called his own,
      Betrayed, forsaken or denied,
    He met his enemies alone,
      In all their malice, rage, and pride.

3   But hark! he prays;--'tis for his foes;
      He speaks;--'tis comfort to his friends;
    Answers;--and Paradise bestows;
      "'Tis finished!"--here the conflict ends.

4   "Truly, this was the Son of God!"
      --Though in a servant's mean disguise,
    And bruised beneath the Father's rod,
      Not for himself,--for man he dies.

1   'T is midnight; and on Olive's brow
      The star is dimmed that lately shone;
    'T is midnight; in the garden, now,
      The suffering Saviour prays alone.

2   'T is midnight; and from all removed,
      The Saviour wrestles lone, with fears;
    E'en that disciple whom he loved
      Heeds not his Master's grief and tears.

3   'T is midnight; and for others' guilt
      The man of sorrows weeps in blood;
    Yet he that hath in anguish knelt
      Is not forsaken by his God.

4   'T is midnight; from celestial plains
      Is borne the song that angels know;
    Unheard by mortals are the strains
      That sweetly soothe the Saviour's woe.

Agony in the Garden.


1   Dark was the night and cold the ground
      On which the Lord was laid;
    His sweat like drops of blood ran down;
      In agony he prayed,--

2   "Father, remove this bitter cup,
      If such thy sacred will;
    If not, content to drink it up,
      Thy pleasure I fulfil."

3   Go to the garden, sinner; see
      Those precious drops that flow;
    The heavy load he bore for thee;
      For thee he lies so low.

4   Then learn of him the cross to bear;
      Thy Father's will obey;
    And, when temptations press thee near,
      Awake to watch and pray.

Christ our Example in Sufferings.


1     Go to dark Gethsemane,
        Ye that feel temptation's power,
      Your Redeemer's conflict see,
        Watch with him one bitter hour.
    Turn not from his griefs away,
    Learn of Jesus Christ to pray.

2     Follow to the judgment-hall,
        View the Lord of life arraigned:
      O the wormwood and the gall!
        O the pangs his soul sustained!
    Shun not suffering, shame or loss;
    Learn of him to bear the cross.

3     Calvary's mournful mountain climb;
        There, admiring at his feet,
      Mark that miracle of time,
        God's own sacrifice complete:
    "It is finished," hear him cry;
    Learn of Jesus Christ to die.

4     Early hasten to the tomb
        Where they laid his breathless clay;
      All is solitude and gloom;
        --Who has taken him away?
    Christ is risen; he meets our eyes--
    Saviour, teach us so to rise.

The Crucifixion of Christ.


1   Behold the Saviour on the cross,
      A spectacle of woe!
    See from his agonizing wounds
      The blood incessant flow;

2   Till death's pale ensigns o'er his cheek
      And trembling lips were spread;
    Till light forsook his closing eyes,
      And life his drooping head.

3   'Tis finished--the Messiah dies
      For sins, but not his own;
    The great redemption is complete,
      And death is overthrown.

4   'Tis finished--ritual worship ends,
      And Gospel ages run;
    All old things now are past away,
      A new world is begun.

A Dying Saviour.


1   Stretched on the cross, the Saviour dies,
    Hark! his expiring groans arise;
    See, from his hands, his feet, his side,
    Descends the sacred, crimson tide.

2   And didst thou bleed?--for sinners bleed?
    And could the sun behold the deed?
    No; he withdrew his cheering ray,
    And darkness veiled the mourning day.

3   Can I survey this scene of woe,
    Where mingling grief and mercy flow,
    And yet my heart so hard remain,--
    Unmoved by either love or pain!

4   Come, dearest Lord, thy grace impart,
    To warm this cold, this stupid heart,
    Till all its powers and passions move,
    In melting grief and ardent love.

Christ Suffering on the Cross.


1   "'T is finished!"--so the Saviour cried,
    And meekly bowed his head and died:
    "'T is finished!"--yes, the race is run,
    The battle fought, the victory won.

2   "'T is finished!"--all that heaven foretold
    By prophets in the days of old;
    And truths are opened to our view,
    That kings and prophets never knew.

3   "'T is finished!"--Son of God, thy power
    Hath triumphed in this awful hour;
    And yet our eyes with sorrow see
    That life to us was death to thee.

4   "'T is finished!"--let the joyful sound
    Be heard through all the nations round;
    "'Tis finished!"--let the triumph rise,
    And swell the chorus of the skies.

Christ's Death and Resurrection.


1   He dies! the Friend of sinners dies!
      Lo, Salem's daughters weep around!
    A solemn darkness veils the skies!
      A sudden trembling shakes the ground!

2   Come, saints, and drop a tear or two
      For him who groaned beneath your load!
    He shed a thousand drops for you--
      A thousand drops of richest blood!

3   Here's love and grief beyond degree;
      The Lord of glory dies for men;--
    But lo, what sudden joys we see!
      Jesus, the dead, revives again!

4   The rising Lord forsakes the tomb--
      The tomb in vain forbids his rise;
    Cherubic legions guard him home,
