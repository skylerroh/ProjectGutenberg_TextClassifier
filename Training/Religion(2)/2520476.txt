    Preserved by thee for ages past,
    For ages may thy kindness last.

The Pilgrims.


1   Our fathers, Lord, to seek a spot
      Where they might kneel to thee,
    Their own fair heritage forgot,
      And braved an unknown sea.

2   Here found their pilgrim souls repose
      Where long the heathen roved;
    And here their humble anthems rose
      To bless the Power they loved.

3   They sleep in dust,--but where they trod,
      A feeble, fainting band,
    Glad millions catch the strain, O God,
      And sound it through the land.

Anniversary Hymn.


1   God of mercy, do thou never
      From our offering turn away,
    But command a blessing ever
      On the memory of this day.

2   Light and peace do thou ordain it;
      O'er it be no shadow flung,
    Let no deadly darkness stain it,
      And no clouds be o'er it hung.

3   May the song this people raises,
      And its vows to thee addressed,
    Mingle with the prayers and praises,
      That thou hearest from the blest.

4   When the lips are cold that sing thee,
      And the hearts that love thee dust,
    Father, then our souls shall bring thee
      Holier love and firmer trust.

1   Parent of all, omnipotent!
      In heaven and earth below!
    Through all creation's vast extent
      Whose streams of goodness flow:

2   Teach me to know from whence I rose,
      And unto what designed;
    No private aims may I propose,
      That injure human kind.

3   To hear my country's lawful voice
      May my best thoughts incline;
    'Tis reason's law, 'tis virtue's choice,
      'Tis nature's call, and thine.

4   Me from fair freedom's sacred cause
      May nothing e'er divide;
    Nor grandeur, gold, nor vain applause,
      Nor friendship false, misguide.

5   To duty, honor, virtue true,
      In all my country's weal,
    Let me my public walk pursue:
      So, God, thy favor deal.

      To cheer the plains below;
    He makes the grass the mountains crown,
      And corn in valleys grow.

3   His steady councils change the face
      Of each declining year;
    He bids the sun cut short his race,
      And wintry days appear.

    O, may our lips and lives make known

    Rejoice, in sacred lays rejoice.

    Pour out their blessings from the sky,
      To cheer the thirsty land.

3     The hills, on every side,
      Rejoice at falling showers:
    The meadows, dressed in all their pride,
      Perfume the air with flowers.

4     The ridges drink their fill,
      And ranks of corn appear;
    Thy ways abound with blessings still,

      'Tis nature's cheerful voice;
    Soft music hails the lovely spring,
      And woods and fields rejoice.

3   O God of nature and of grace,
      Thy heavenly gifts impart;
    Then shall my meditation trace
      Spring blooming in my heart.

4   Inspired to praise, I then shall join
      Glad nature's cheerful song,
    And love and gratitude divine
      Attune my joyful tongue.

      Their thousand notes of praise;
    And all, that by his mercy live,

3   The streams, all beautiful and bright,
      Reflect the morning sky;
    And there, with music in his flight,
      The wild bird soars on high.

4   Thus, like the morning, calm and clear,
      That saw the Saviour rise,
    The spring of heaven's eternal year
      Shall dawn on earth and skies.

    At thy Almighty word appear;
    And all the seasons, as they roll,

    And always, since creation's dawn,
      The stars together sing.

3   Shall man remain in silence, then,
      While all beneath the skies
    The chorus joins? no, let us sing,
      And while our voices rise,

      A constant melody;
    And every action be a tone
      In that sweet hymn to thee!

Autumn.


1   The leaves, around me falling,
      Are preaching of decay;
    The hollow winds are calling,
      "Come, pilgrim, come away:"
    The day, in night declining,
      Says I must, too, decline;
    The year its bloom resigning,
      Its lot foreshadows mine.

2   The light my path surrounding,
      The loves to which I cling,
    The hopes within me bounding,
      The joys that round me wing,--
    All, all, like stars at even,
      Just gleam and shoot away,
    Pass on before to heaven,
      And chide at my delay.

3   The friends gone there before me
      Are calling from on high,
    And happy angels o'er me
      Tempt sweetly to the sky:
    "Why wait," they say, "and wither,
      'Mid scenes of death and sin?
    O, rise to glory, hither,
      And find true life begin."

2   When, from his dreadful stores on high,
      God pours the sounding hail,
    The man that does his power defy
      Shall find his courage fail.

3   God sends his word and melts the snow;
      The fields no longer mourn;
    He calls the warmer gales to blow,
      And bids the spring return.

      Obey his mighty word;
    With songs and honors sounding loud,
      Praise ye the sovereign Lord.

2   Let every vile and sinful yoke
      Of servile bondage and of fear,
    By mercy, love and truth be broke;
      And from each eye wipe every tear.

3   Yes, to the hungry deal thy bread;
      Bring to thine house the outcast poor;
    There let the fainting soul be fed,
      Nor spurn the needy from thy door.

4   And when thou seest the naked, spare
      The raiment that his wants demand;
    Since all mankind thy kindred are,
      To all thy charity expand.

5   Thus did the Saviour of our race:
      Himself, the Bread of Life, he gave;
    He clothed us with his righteousness,
      And broke the fetters from the slave.

3   O, send thy pity from on high
      With pardon all-divine;
    Bring now thy gracious spirit nigh,
      And make us wholly thine.

3   Our sins, alas! before thee rise;
      Thou knowest all our guilt;
    Let not our faith, our hope, our trust,
      On earthly things be built.

4   Forgive our sins, thy spirit grant,
      Let love our souls refine,
    And heavenly peace and holy hope
      Assure that we are thine.

"Is it such a fast that I have chosen?"


1     "Is this a fast for me?"--
      Thus saith the Lord our God;--
    "A day for man to vex his soul,
      And feel affliction's rod?--

2     "Like bulrush low to bow
      His sorrow-stricken head,
    With sackcloth for his inner vest,
      And ashes round him spread?

3     "Shall day like this have power
      To stay th' avenging hand,
    Efface transgression, or avert
      My judgments from the land?

4     "No; is not this alone
      The sacred fast I choose,--
    Oppression's yoke be burst in twain,
      The bands of guilt unloose?--

5     "To nakedness and want
      Your food and raiment deal,
    To dwell your kindred race among,
      And all their sufferings heal?

6     "Then, like the morning ray,
      Shall spring your health and light;
    Before you, righteousness shall shine,
      Behind, my glory bright!"

Public Humiliation.


1   Great Maker of unnumbered worlds,
      And whom unnumbered worlds adore,--
    Whose goodness all thy creatures share,
      While nature trembles at thy power,--

2   Thine is the hand that moves the spheres,
      That wakes the wind, and lifts the sea;
    And man, who moves the lord of earth,
      Acts but the part assigned by thee.

3   While suppliant crowds implore thine aid,
      To thee we raise the humble cry;
    Thine altar is the contrite heart,
      Thine incense the repentant sigh.

4   O may our land, in this her hour,
      Confess thy hand, and bless the rod,
    By penitence make thee her friend,
      And find in thee a guardian God.

Public Supplication.


1   When Abrah'm, full of sacred awe,
      Before Jehovah stood,
    And, with an humble, fervent prayer,
      For guilty Sodom sued,--

2   With what success, what wondrous grace,
      Was his petition crowned!
    The Lord would spare, if in this place
      Ten righteous men were found.

3   And could a single pious soul
      So rich a boon obtain?
    Great God, and shall a nation cry,
      And plead with thee in vain?

4   Are not the righteous dear to thee
      Now, as in ancient times?
    Or does this sinful land exceed
      Gomorrah in her crimes?

5   Still we are thine; we bear thy name;
      Here yet is thine abode:
    Long has thy presence blessed our land:
      Forsake us not, O God.

Judgments for National Sins Deprecated.


1   Almighty Lord, before thy throne
      Thy mourning people bend;
    'Tis on thy pardoning grace alone
      Our dying hopes depend.

2   Dark judgments, from thy heavy hand,
      Thy dreadful power display;
    Yet mercy spares our guilty land,
      And still we live to pray.

3   How changed, alas! are truths divine,
      For error, guilt, and shame!
    What impious numbers, bold in sin,
      Disgrace the Christian name!

4   O, turn us, turn us, mighty Lord;
      Convert us by thy grace;
    Then shall our hearts obey thy word,
      And see again thy face.

5   Then, should oppressing foes invade,
      We will not yield to fear,
    Secure of all-sufficient aid,
      When thou, O God, art near.

In time of War.


1   While sounds of war are heard around,
    And death and ruin strow the ground,
    To thee we look, on thee we call,
    The Parent and the Lord of all.

2   Thou, who hast stamped on human kind
    The image of a heaven-born mind,
    And in a Father's wide embrace
    Hast cherished all the kindred race,--

3   Great God, whose powerful hand can bind
    The raging waves, the furious wind,
    O, bid the human tempest cease,
    And hush the maddening world to peace.

4   With reverence may each hostile land
    Hear and obey that high command,
    Thy Son's blest errand from above,--
    "My creatures, live in mutual love!"

Thanksgiving Hymn.


1   The God of harvest praise;
    In loud thanksgivings raise
      Hand, heart, and voice;
    The valleys smile and sing,
    Forests and mountains ring,
    The plains their tribute bring,
      The streams rejoice.

2   Yea, bless his holy name,
    And purest thanks proclaim
      Through all the earth;
    To glory in your lot
    Is duty,--but be not
    God's benefits forgot,
      Amidst your mirth.

3   The God of harvest praise;
    Hands, hearts, and voices raise,
      With sweet accord;
    From field to garner throng,
    Bearing your sheaves along,
    And in your harvest song
      Bless ye the Lord.

1   Fountain of mercy, God of love,
      How rich thy bounties are!
    The rolling seasons, as they move,
      Proclaim thy constant care.

2   When in the bosom of the earth
      The sower hid the grain,
    Thy goodness marked its secret birth,
      And sent the early rain.

3   The spring's sweet influence, Lord, was thine
      The plants in beauty grew;
    Thou gav'st refulgent suns to shine,
      And mild, refreshing dew.

4   These various mercies from above
      Matured the swelling grain;
    A kindly harvest crowns thy love,
      And plenty fills the plain.

5   We own and bless thy gracious sway;
      Thy hand all nature hails;
    Seed-time nor harvest, night nor day,
      Summer nor winter, fails.
