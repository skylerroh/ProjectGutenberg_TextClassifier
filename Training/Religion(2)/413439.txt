May grow to clubs and naked swords,
To murder and to death.

4 The devil tempts one mother's son
To rage against another:
So wicked Cain was hurried on,
Till he had kill'd his brother.

5 The wise will make their anger cool
At least before `tis night;
But in the bosom of a fool
It burns till morning light.

5 Pardon, O Lord, our childish rage;
Our little brawls remove;
That as we grow to riper age,
Our hearts may all be love.


Song 18.
_Against Scoffing and calling Names_.

1 Our tongues were made to bless the Lord,
And not speak ill of men:
When others give a railing word,
We must not rail again.

2 Cross words and angry names require
To be chastiz'd at school;
And he's in danger of hell-fire,
That calls his brother, fool.

3 But lips that dare be so prophane
To mock and jeer and scoff
At holy things, or holy men,
The Lord shall cut them off.

4 When children, in their wanton play
Served old Elisha so,
And bade the prophet go his way,
"Go up, thou bald head, go."

5 God quickly stopt their wicked breath,
And sent two raging bears,
That tore them limb from limb to death,
With blood and groans and tears.

6 Great God, how terrible art thou
To sinners ne'er so young!
Grant me thy grace and teach me how
To tame and rule my tongue.


Song 19.
_Against Swearing and Cursing, and taking God's Name in vain_.

1 Angels that high in glory dwell
Adore thy Name, Almighty God!
And devils tremble down in hell
Beneath the terrors of thy rod.

2 And yet how wicked children dare
Abuse thy dreadful glorious Name!
And when they're angry, how they swear,
And curse their fellows, and blaspheme!

3 How will they stand before thy face,
Who treated thee with such disdain,
While thou shalt doom them to the place
Of everlasting fire and pain?

4 Then never shall one cooling drop
To quench their burning tongues be giv'n.
But I will praise thee here, and hope
Thus to employ my tongue in heav'n.

5 My heart shall be in pain to hear
Wretches affront the Lord above;
'Tis that great God whose power I fear,
That heavenly Father whom I love.

6 If my companions grow profane,
I'll leave their friendship when I hear
Young sinners take thy name in vain,
And learn to curse, and learn to swear.


Song 20.
_Against Idleness and Mischief_.

1 How doth the little busy bee
Improve each shining hour,
And gather honey all the day
From every opening flower!

2 How skilfully she builds her cell!
How neat she spreads the wax!
And labours hard to store it well
With the sweet food she makes.

3 In works of labour or of skill
I would be busy too:
For Satan finds some mischief still
For idle hands to do.

4 In books, or work, or healthful play
Let my first years be past,
That I may give for every day
Some good account at last.


Song 21.
_Against evil Company_.

1 Why should I join with those in play
In whom I've no delight;
Who curse and swear, but never play;
Who call ill names, and fight?

2 I hate to hear a wanton song:
Their words offend my ears:
I should not dare defile my tongue
With language such as theirs.

3 Away from fools I'll turn my eyes,
Nor with the scoffers go:
I would be walking with the wise,
That wiser I may grow.

4 From one rude boy, that's used to mock,
They learn the wicked jest:
One sickly sheep infects the flock,
And poisons all the rest.

5 My God, I hate to walk or dwell
With sinful children here:
Then let me not be sent to hell,
Where none but sinners are.


Song 22.
_Against Pride in Clothes_.

1 Why should our garments, made to hide
Our parents' shame, provoke our pride?
The art of dress did ne'er begin
Till Eve our mother learnt to sin.

2 When first she put the covering on,
Her robe of innocence was gone;
And yet her children vainly boast
In the sad marks of glory lost.

3 How proud we are! how fond to shew
Our clothes, and call them rich and new,
When the poor sheep and silkworms wore
That very clothing long before!

4 The tulip and the butterfly
Appear in gayer coats than I:
Let me be dress'd fine as I will,
Flies, worms, and flowers exceed me still.

5 Then will I set my heart to find
Inward adornings of the mind:
Knowledge and virtue, truth and grace,
These are the robes of richest dress.

6 No more shall worms with me compare,
This is the raiment angels wear:
The Son of God, when here below,
Put on this blest apparel too.

6 It never fades, it ne'er grows old,
Nor fears the rain, nor moth, nor mould:
It takes no spot, but still refines;
The more `tis worn, the more it shines.

7 In this on earth would I appear,
Then go to heaven, and wear it there:
God will approve it in his sight;
'Tis his own work, and his delight.


Song 23.
_Obedience to Parents_.

1 Let children that would fear the Lord
Hear what their teachers say;
With reverence meet their parents' word,
And with delight obey.

2 Have you not heard what dreadful plagues
Are threaten'd by the Lord,
To him that breaks his father's law,
Or mocks his mother's word?

3 What heavy guilt upon him lies!
How cursed is his name!
The ravens shall pick out his eyes,
