  O Thou, from whom all blessings flow,
  I lift my heart to Thee;
  In all my sorrows, conflicts, woes,
  Dear Lord, remember me. Amen.


68.

Dear Father, Thy child is sick. Look upon me in tender mercy, and if it
be Thy will, raise me up and grant me health and strength. Amen.


69.

Heavenly Father, it hath pleased Thee to visit me with sickness, I know
that Thou art too kind and good to send me anything but for my blessing.
Help me to bear my illness and grant that I may soon recover, through
Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior. Amen.

  Other refuge have I none;
  Hangs my helpless soul on Thee:
  Leave, ah! leave me not alone,
  Still support and comfort me.
  All my trust on Thee is stayed,
  All my help from Thee I bring;
  Cover my defenseless head
  With the shadow of Thy wing! Amen.


71.

  Lord, gracious God, I cry to Thee,
  Still bless me with Thy favor,
  Forgive my sins, and let me live,
  Thy child remain forever.

  Thou hast redeemed me with Thy blood,
  Thou art my only Trust and God
  In every need, my Savior. Amen.


72.

  Nearer, my God, to Thee,
  Nearer to Thee!
  E'en though it be a cross
  That raiseth me;
  Still all my song shall be,
  Nearer, my God, to Thee,
  Nearer, my God, to Thee,
  Nearer to Thee. Amen.


73.

Lord Jesus Christ, my best Physician, I come to Thee in this my
sickness. I pray Thee to look upon me in tender mercy. Send Thy guardian
angel to watch over me and soon make me well. Amen.


74.

Lord Jesus, look down from heaven upon my mama (papa, brother, sister)
and soon make her (him) well again. Thou canst do all things; hear my
prayer! Amen.

  Holy Jesus, every day
  Keep us in the narrow way,
  And when earthly things are past,
  Bring our ransomed souls at last
  Where they need no star to guide.
  Where no clouds Thy glory hide. Amen.


76.

  As a little child relies
  On a care beyond his own;
  Knows he's neither strong nor wise,
  Fears to stir a step alone,--
  Let me thus with Thee abide
  As my Father, Guard, and Guide!
  Amen.


77.

  Faithful Shepherd, feed me
  In the pastures green;
  Faithful Shepherd, lead me
  Where Thy steps are seen.

  Hold me fast and guide me
  In the narrow way;
  So, with Thee beside me,
  I shall never stray.

  Daily bring me nearer
  To the heavenly shore;
  May my faith grow clearer.
  May I love Thee more!

  Hallow every pleasure,
  Every gift and pain;
  Be Thyself my Treasure.
  Though none else I gain. Amen.


78.

  We thank Thee, heav'nly Father,
  For ev'ry earthly good,
  For life, and health, and clothing,
  And for our daily food.

  O give us hearts to thank Thee,
  For ev'ry blessing sent,
  And whatsoe'er Thou sendest
  Make us therewith content. Amen.


79.

  Holy Jesus, be my Light,
  Shine upon my way;
  Through this tempting, changing life
  Lead me day by day. Amen.


80.

  Lord, be Thou my constant Guide,
  Lead me all the way,
  Till I reach Thy home at last,
  Nevermore to stray. Amen.


81.

  O God, Thou faithful God,
  Thou Fount that ever flowest,
  Without whom nothing is,
  Who all good gifts bestowest:
  A pure and healthy frame
  O give me and within
  A conscience free from blame,
  A soul unhurt by sin. Amen.
