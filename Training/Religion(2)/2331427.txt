glow and understanding.

The pent-up elements of mortal mind need no terrible [5]
detonation to free them. Envy, rivalry, hate need no
temporary indulgence that they be destroyed through
suffering; they should be stifled from lack of air and
freedom.

My students, with cultured intellects, chastened affec- [10]
tions, and costly hopes, give promise of grand careers.
But they must remember that the seedtime is passed,
the harvest hour has come; and songs should ascend
from the mount of revelation, sweeter than the sound of
vintage bells. [15]

The seed of Christian Science, which when sown was
"the least of all seeds," has sprung up, borne fruit, and
the birds of the air, the uplifted desires of the human
heart, have lodged in its branches. Now let my faithful
students carry the fruit of this tree into the rock-ribbed [20]
nests of the raven's callow brood.

The second stage of mental development is humility.
This virtue triumphs over the flesh; it is the genius of
Christian Science. One can never go up, until one has
gone down in his own esteem. Humility is lens and [25]
prism to the understanding of Mind-healing; it must be
had to understand our textbook; it is indispensable to
personal growth, and points out the chart of its divine
Principle and rule of practice.

Cherish humility, "watch," and "pray without ceasing," [30]
or you will miss the way of Truth and Love. Humility
is no busybody: it has no moments for trafficking

[Page 357.]

in other people's business, no place for envy, no time for [1]
idle words, vain amusements, and all the _et cetera_ of the
ways and means of personal sense.

Let Christian Scientists minister to the sick; the school-
room is the _dernier ressort_. Let them seek the lost sheep [5]
who, having strayed from the true fold, have lost their
great Shepherd and yearn to find living pastures and
rest beside still waters. These long for the Christlike-
ness that is above the present status of religion and be-
yond the walks of common life, quite on the verge of [10]
heaven. Without the cross and healing, Christianity has
no central emblem, no history.

The seeds of Truth fall by the wayside, on artless
listeners. They fall on stony ground and shallow soil.
The fowls of the air pick them up. Much of what has [15]
been sown has withered away, but what remaineth has
fallen into the good and honest hearts and is bearing
fruit.

The third stage of mental growth is manifested in _love_,
the greatest of all stages and states of being; love that [20]
is irrespective of self, rank, or following. For some time
it has been clear to my thought that those students of
Christian Science whose Christian characters and lives
recommend them, should receive full fellowship from us,
no matter who has taught them. If they have been taught [25]
wrongly, they are not morally responsible for this, and
need special help. They are as lambs that have sought
the true fold and the great Shepherd, and strayed inno-
cently; hence we should be ready and glad to help them
and point the way. [30]

Divine Love is the substance of Christian Science, the
basis of its demonstration, yea, its foundation and super-

[Page 358.]

structure. Love impels good works. Love is greatly [1]
needed, and must be had to mark the way in divine
Science.

The student who heals by teaching and teaches by
healing, will graduate under divine honors, which are [5]
the only appropriate seals for Christian Science. State
honors perish, and their gain is loss to the Christian
Scientist. They include for him at present naught but
tardy justice, hounded footsteps, false laurels. God
alone is his help, his shield and great reward. He that [10]
seeketh aught besides God, loseth in Life, Truth, and
Love. All men shall be satisfied when they "awake in
His likeness," and they never should be until then. Hu-
man pride is human weakness. Self-knowledge, humility,
and love are divine strength. Christ's vestures are put [15]
on only when mortals are "washed in the blood of the
Lamb;" we must walk in the way which Jesus marked
out, if we would reach the heaven-crowned summit of
Christian Science.

Be it understood that I do not require Christian Sci- [20]
entists to stop teaching, to dissolve their organizations,
or to desist from organizing churches and associations.

The Massachusetts Metaphysical College, the first
and only College for teaching Christian Science Mind-
healing, after accomplishing the greatest work of the [25]
ages, and at the pinnacle of prosperity, is closed. Let
Scientists who have grown to self-sacrifice do their
present work, awaiting, with staff in hand, God's
commands.

When students have fulfilled all the good ends of [30]
organization, and are convinced that by leaving the
material forms thereof a higher spiritual unity is won,

[Page 359.]

then is the time to follow the example of the _Alma Mater_. [1]
Material organization is requisite in the beginning; but
when it has done its work, the purely Christly method
of teaching and preaching must be adopted. On the same
principle, you continue the mental argument in the prac- [5]
tice of Christian healing until you can cure without it
instantaneously, and through Spirit alone.

St. Paul says: "When I was a child, I spake as a
child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but
when I became a man, I put away childish things. For [10]
now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to
face." Growth is restricted by forcing humanity out of
the proper channels for development, or by holding it in
fetters.

For Jesus to walk the water was scientific, insomuch [15]
as he was able to do this; but it is neither wisdom nor
Science for poor humanity to step upon the Atlantic until
we can walk on the water.

Peter's impetuosity was rebuked. He had to learn
from experience; so have we. The methods of our [20]
Master were in advance of the period in which he per-
sonally appeared; but his example was right, and is
available at the right time. The _way_ is absolute divine
Science: walk ye in it; but remember that Science is
demonstrated by degrees, and our demonstration rises [25]
only as we rise in the scale of being.




Science And Philosophy


Men give counsel; but they give not the wisdom to
profit by it. To ask wisdom of God, is the beginning of
wisdom. [30]

[Page 360.]

Meekness, moderating human desire, inspires wisdom [1]
and procures divine power. Human lives are yet un-
carved,--in the rough marble, encumbered with crude,
rude fragments, and awaiting the hammering, chiselling,
and transfiguration from His hand. [5]

Great only as good, because fashioned divinely, were
those unpretentious yet colossal characters, Paul and
Jesus. Theirs were modes of mind cast in the moulds
of Christian Science: Paul's, by the supremely natural
transforming power of Truth; and the character of [10]
Jesus, by his original scientific sonship with God. Phi-
losophy never has produced, nor can it reproduce, these
stars of the first magnitude--fixed stars in the heavens
of Soul. When shall earth be crowned with the true
knowledge of Christ? [15]

When Christian Science has melted away the cloud of
false witnesses; and the dews of divine grace, fall-
ing upon the blighted flowers of fleeting joys, shall
lift every thought-leaflet Spiritward; and "Israel after
the flesh," who partaketh of its own altars, shall be [20]
no more,--then, "the Israel according to Spirit"
shall fill earth with the divine energies, understanding,
and ever-flowing tides of spiritual sensation and consciousness.

When mortal mind is silenced by the "still, small voice" [25]
of Truth that regenerates philosophy and logic; and
Jesus, as the true idea of Him, is heard as of yore saying
to sensitive ears and dark disciples, "I came from the
Father," "Before Abraham was, I am," coexistent and
coeternal with God,--and this idea is understood,-- [30]
then will the earth be filled with the true knowledge of
Christ. No advancing modes of human mind made

[Page 361.]

Jesus; rather was it their subjugation, and the pure [1]
heart that sees God.

When the belief in material origin, mortal mind, sen-
sual conception, dissolves through self-imposed suffering,
and its substances are found substanceless,--then its [5]
miscalled life ends in death, and death itself is swallowed
up in Life,--spiritual Life, whose myriad forms are
neither material nor mortal.

When every form and mode of evil disappear to hu-
man thought, and mollusk and radiate are spiritual con- [10]
cepts testifying to one creator,--then, earth is full of
His glory, and Christian Science has overshadowed all
human philosophy, and being is understood in startling
contradiction of human hypotheses; and Socrates, Plato,
Kant, Locke, Berkeley, Tyndall, Darwin, and Spencer [15]
sit at the feet of Jesus.

To this great end, Paul admonished, "Let us lay aside
every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us,
and let us run with patience the race that is set before
us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our [20]
faith." So shall mortals soar to final freedom, and rest
from the subtlety of speculative wisdom and human
woe.

God is the only Mind, and His manifestation is the
spiritual universe, including man and all eternal indi- [25]
viduality. God, the only substance and divine Principle
of creation, is by no means a creative partner in the firm
of error, named matter, or mortal mind. He elucidates
His own idea, wherein Principle and idea, God and man,
are not one, but are inseparable as cause and effect. If [30]
one, who could say which that "one" was?

His ways are not as our ways. The divine modes

[Page 362.]

and manifestations are not those of the material senses; [1]
for instance, intelligent matter, or mortal mind, material
birth, growth, and decay: they are the forever-existing
realities of divine Science; wherein God and man are
perfect, and man's reason is at rest in God's wisdom,-- [5]
who comprehends and reflects all real mode, form, indi-
viduality, identity.

Scholastic dogma has made men blind. Christ's _logos_
gives sight to these blind, ears to these deaf, feet to these
lame,--physically, morally, spiritually. Theologians [10]
make the mortal mistake of believing that God, having
made _all_, made evil; but the Scriptures declare that all
that He made was good. Then, was evil part and parcel
of His creation?

Philosophy hypothetically regards creation as its own [15]
creator, puts cause into effect, and out of nothing would
create something, whose noumenon is mortal mind,
with its phenomenon matter,--an evil mind already
doomed, whose modes are material manifestations of
evil, and that continually, until self-extinguished by [20]
suffering!

Here revelation must come to the rescue of mortals,
to remove this mental millstone that is dragging them
downward, and refute erring reason with the spiritual
cosmos and Science of Soul. We all must find shelter [25]
from the storm and tempest in the tabernacle of Spirit.
Truth is won through Science or suffering: O vain mor-
tals! which shall it be? And suffering has no reward,
except when it is necessary to prevent sin or reform
the sinner. And pleasure is no crime except when it [30]
strengthens the influence of bad inclinations or lessens
the activities of virtue. The more nearly an erring so-

[Page 363.]

called mind approaches purity, the more conscious it [1]
becomes of its own unreality, and of the great reality of
divine Mind and true happiness.

The "ego" that claims selfhood in error, and passes
from molecule and monkey up to man, is no ego, but is [5]
simply the supposition that the absence of good is mind
and makes men,--when its greatest flatterer, identifica-
tion, is piqued by Him who compensateth vanity with
nothingness, dust with dust!

The mythology of evil and mortality is but the ma- [10]
terial mode of a suppositional mind; while the immortal
modes of Mind are spiritual, and pass through none of
the changes of matter, or evil. Truth said, and said from
the beginning, "Let us [Spirit] make man perfect;" and
there is no other Maker: a perfect man would not desire [15]
to make himself imperfect, and God is not chargeable
with imperfection. His modes declare the beauty of holi-
ness, and His manifold wisdom shines through the visible
world in glimpses of the eternal verities. Even through
the mists of mortality is seen the brightness of His [20]
coming.

We must avoid the shoals of a sensual religion or
philosophy that misguides reason and affection, and
hold fast to the Principle of Christian Science as the
Word that _is_ God, Spirit, and Truth. This Word cor- [25]
rects the philosopher, confutes the astronomer, exposes
the subtle sophist, and drives diviners mad. The Bible
is the learned man's masterpiece, the ignorant man's
dictionary, the wise man's directory.

I foresee and foresay that every advancing epoch of so [30]
Truth will be characterized by a more spiritual appre-
hension of the Scriptures, that will show their marked

[Page 364.]

consonance with the textbook of Christian Science Mind- [1]
healing, "Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures."
Interpreting the Word in the "new tongue," whereby
the sick are healed, naturally evokes new paraphrase
from the world of letters. "Wait patiently on the Lord, [5]
and He will renew your strength." In return for indi-
vidual sacrifice, what a recompense to have healed, through
Truth, the sick and sinful, made the public your friend,
and posterity your familiar!

Christian Science refutes everything that is not a [10]
postulate of the divine Principle, God. It is the soul of
divine philosophy, and there is no other philosophy. It
is not a search after wisdom, it _is_ wisdom: it is God's
right hand grasping the universe,--all time, space,
immortality, thought, extension, cause, and effect; con- [15]
stituting and governing all identity, individuality, law,
and power. It stands on this Scriptural platform:
that He made all that was made, and it is good, reflects
the divine Mind, is governed by it; and that nothing
apart from this Mind, one God, is self-created or evolves [20]
the universe.

Human hypotheses predicate matter of Spirit and
evil of good; hence these opposites must either cooperate
or quarrel throughout time and eternity,--or until
this impossible partnership is dissolved. If Spirit is the [25]
lawgiver to matter, and good has the same power or
modes as evil, it has the same consciousness, and there
is no absolute good. This error, carried to its ultimate,
would either extinguish God and His modes, or give
reality and power to evil _ad infinitum_. [30]

Christian Science rends this veil of the temple of gods,
and reproduces the divine philosophy of Jesus and Paul.

[Page 365.]

This philosophy alone will bear the strain of time and [1]
bring out the glories of eternity; for "other founda-
tion can no man lay than that is laid," which is Christ,
Truth.

Human theories weighed in the balances of God are [5]
found wanting; and their highest endeavors are to Science
what a child's love of pictures is to art. The school whose
schoolmaster is not Christ, gets things wrong, and is ignorant
thereof.

If Christian Science lacked the proof of its goodness [10]
and utility, it would destroy itself; for it rests alone on
demonstration. Its genius is right thinking and right
acting, physical and moral harmony; and the secret of
its success lies in supplying the universal need of better
health and better men. [15]

Good health and a more spiritual religion form the
common want, and this want has worked out a moral
result; namely, that mortal mind is calling for what im-
mortal Mind alone can supply. If the uniform moral
and spiritual, as well as physical, effects of divine Science [20]
were lacking, the demand would diminish; but it con-
tinues, and increases, which shows the real value of
Christian Science to the race. Even doctors agree that
infidelity, bigotry, or sham has never met the growing
wants of humanity. [25]

As a literature, Christian metaphysics is hampered by
lack of proper terms in which to express what it means.
As a Science, it is held back by the common ignorance
of what it is and of what it does,--and more than all
else, by the impostors that come in its name. To be [30]
appreciated, it must be conscientiously understood and
introduced.

[Page 366.]

If the Bible and "Science and Health with Key to the [1]
Scriptures" had in our schools the time or attention that
human hypotheses consume, they would advance the
world. True, it requires more study to understand and
demonstrate what they teach than to learn the doctrine [5]
of theology, philosophy, or physics, because they con-
tain and offer Science, with fixed Principle, given rule,
and unmistakable proof.

The Scriptures give the keynote of Christian Science
from Genesis to Revelation, and this is the prolonged [10]
tone: "For the Lord He is God, and there is
_none beside Him_." And because He is All-in-all,
He is in nothing unlike Himself; and nothing that
worketh or maketh a lie is in Him, or can be divine con-
sciousness. [15]

At this date, poor jaded humanity needs to get her
eyes open to a new style of imposition in the field of
medicine and of religion, and to "beware of the leaven
of the scribes and Pharisees," the doctrines of men, even
as Jesus admonished. From first to last, evil insists on [20]
the unity of good and evil as the purpose of God; and
on drugs, electricity, and animal magnetism as modes
of medicine. To a greater or less extent, all mortal conclusions
start from this false premise, and they necessarily
culminate in sickness, sin, disease, and death. [25]
Erroneous doctrines never have abated and never will
abate dishonesty, self-will, envy, and lust. To destroy
sin and its sequence, is the office of Christ, Truth,--ac-
cording to His mode of Christian Science; and this is
being done daily. [30]

The false theories whose names are legion, gilded with
sophistry and what Jesus had not, namely, mere book-

[Page 367.]

learning,--letter without law, gospel, or demonstration, [1]
--have no place in Christian Science. This Science re-
quires man to be honest, just, pure; to love his neighbor
as himself, and to love God supremely.

Matter and evil are subjective states of error or mortal [5]
mind. But Mind is immortal; and the fact of there
being no mortal mind, exposes the lie of suppositional
evil, showing that error is not Mind, substance, or
Life. Thus, whatever is wrongfully-minded will dis-
appear in the proportion that Science is understood, [10]
and the reality of being--goodness and harmony--is
demonstrated.

Error says that knowing all things implies the neces-
sity of knowing evil, that it dishonors God to claim that
He is ignorant of anything; but God says of this fruit [15]
of the tree of knowledge of _both_ good and evil, "In the
day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die." If
God is infinite good, He knows nothing but good; if He
did know aught else, He would not be infinite. Infinite
Mind knows nothing beyond Himself or Herself. To [20]
good, evil is never present; for evil is a different state of
consciousness. It was not against evil, but against _know-_
_ing_ evil, that God forewarned. He dwelleth in light;
and in the light He sees light, and cannot see darkness.
The opposite conclusion, that darkness dwelleth in light, [25]
has neither precedent nor foundation in nature, in logic,
or in the character of Christ.

The senses would say that whatever saves from sin,
must know sin. Truth replies that God is too pure
to behold iniquity; and by virtue of His ignorance of [30]
that which is not, He knoweth that which _is_, and
abideth in Himself, the only Life, Truth, and Love,

[Page 368.]

--and is reflected by a universe in His own image [1]
and likeness.

Even so, Father, let the light that shineth in dark-
ness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not, dispel this
illusion of the senses, open the eyes of the blind, and cause [5]
the deaf to hear.

"Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne.
Yet that scaffold sways the future, and, behind the dim unknown,
Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above His own."
                    LOWELL




"Take Heed!"


We regret to be obliged to say that all are not meta-
physicians, or Christian Scientists, who call themselves
so. Charlatanism, fraud, and malice are getting into
the ranks of the good and pure, sending forth a poison [15]
more deadly than the upas-tree in the eastern archi-
pelago. This evil obtains in the present false teaching
and false practice of the Science of treating disease through
Mind. The silent address of a mental malpractitioner
can only be portrayed in these words of the apostle, [20]
"whisperers," and "the poison of asps is under their
tongue."

Some of the mere puppets of the hour are playing
only for money, and at a fearful stake. Others, from
malice and envy, are working out the destinies of the [25]
damned. But while the best, perverted, on the mortal
plane may become the worst, let us not forget that the
Lord reigns, and that this earth shall some time rejoice
in His supreme rule,--that the tired watchmen on the

[Page 369.]

walls of Zion, and the true Christian Scientist at the foot [1]
of the mount of revelation, shall look up with shouts and
thanksgiving,--that God's law, as in divine Science,
shall be finally understood; and the gospel of glad tidings
bring "on earth peace, good will toward men." [5]




The Cry Of Christmas-Tide


Metaphysics, not physics, enables us to stand erect
on sublime heights, surveying the immeasurable universe
of Mind, peering into the cause which governs all effects,
while we are strong in the unity of God and man. There [10]
is "method" in the "madness" of this system,--since
madness it seems to many onlookers. This method sits
serene at the portals of the temple of thought, while
the leaders of materialistic schools indulge in mad
antics. Metaphysical healing seeks a wisdom that is [15]
higher than a rhubarb tincture or an ipecacuanha pill.
This method is devout enough to trust Christ more than
it does drugs.

Meekly we kneel at our Master's feet, for even a crumb
that falleth from his table. We are hungry for Love, [20]
for the white-winged charity that heals and saves; we
are tired of theoretic husks,--as tired as was the prodi-
gal son of the carobs which he shared with the swine,
to whom he fed that wholesome but unattractive food.
Like him, we would find our Father's house again-- [25]
the perfect and eternal Principle of man. We thirst
for inspiring wine from the vine which our Father tends.
We crave the privilege of saying to the sick, when their

[Page 370.]

feebleness calls for help, "Rise and walk." We rejoice [1]
to say, in the spirit of our Master, "Stretch forth thy
hand, and be whole!"

When the Pharisees saw Jesus do such deeds of mercy,
they went away and took counsel how they might remove [5]
him. The antagonistic spirit of evil is still abroad; but
the greater spirit of Christ is also abroad,--risen from
the grave-clothes of tradition and the cave of ignorance.
Let the sentinels of Zion's watch-towers shout once
again, "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is [10]
given."

In different ages the divine idea assumes different
forms, according to humanity's needs. In this age it
assumes, more intelligently than ever before, the form
of Christian healing. This is the babe we are to cherish. [15]
This is the babe that twines its loving arms about the
neck of omnipotence, and calls forth infinite care from
His loving heart.




Blind Leaders


What figure is less favorable than a wolf in sheep's [20]
clothing? The braying donkey whose ears stick out is
less troublesome. What manner of man is it that has
discovered an improvement on Christian Science, a "met-
aphysical healing" by which error destroys error, and
would gather all sorts into a "national convention" by [25]
the sophistry that such is the true fold for Christian heal-
ers, since the good shepherd cares for all?

Yes; the _good_ Shepherd does care for all, and His
first care is to separate the sheep from the goats; and

[Page 371.]

this is among the first lessons on healing taught by our [1]
great Master.

If, as the gentleman aforesaid states, large flocks of
metaphysicians are wandering about without a leader,
what has opened his eyes to see the need of taking them [5]
out of the care of the great Shepherd, and behold the
remedy, to help them by his own leadership? Is it that
he can guide Christian Scientists better than they, through
the guidance of our common Father, can guide them-
selves? or is it that they are incapable of helping them- [10]
selves thus?

I as their teacher can say, They know far more of
Christian Science than he who deprecates their condition
appears to, and my heart pleads for them to possess
more and more of Truth and Love; but mixing all grades [15]
of persons is not productive of the better sort, although
he who has self-interest in this mixing is apt to pro-
pose it.

Whoever desires to say, "good right, and good wrong,"
has no truth to defend. It is a wise saying that "men [20]
are known by their enemies." To sympathize in any
degree with error, is not to rectify it; but error always
strives to unite, in a definition of purpose, with Truth,
to give it buoyancy. What is under the mask, but error
in borrowed plumes? [25]
