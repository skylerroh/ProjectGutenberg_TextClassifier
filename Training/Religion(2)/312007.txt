[Illustration: I.]

In Bible times so long ago,
  And in a far-off city, too,
A mother watched her only child
  As he in strength and beauty grew.

And when his little tottering feet
  Had scarcely learned to go alone,--
Before his baby voice could speak
  Her name, with a sweet, joyous tone,--

She took her boy and travelled on,
  Away from home, for many a mile,
That with a good and holy man
  Her darling son might live a while;

That he might learn about the God
  Who made the earth and sea and sky;
And then she left him there and turned
  Back to her home, with many a sigh.

She could not place him on her knee
  And tell him he was very dear;
And so she made a little coat
  And brought it to him every year.

But you, my little girl, can learn,
  While you are sitting close by me,
Of heaven, and that kind God above,
  Who made in love each thing we see.

And you should thank Him every day,
  That you can here His goodness know;
And from your pleasant, happy home,
  And your dear parents, need not go.




THE BIRD'S NEST.


[Illustration]

What is Harry thinking of,
  Sitting on that mossy stone?
All his brothers are at play;
  Why is he so still and lone?

He is musing earnestly;
  And the flutterings of the bird
And its pleading, feeble chirp
  Fall upon his ear unheard.

Well may little Harry think!
  From the pear-tree's withered bough
He has brought the pretty nest,
  Placed within his hat-crown now.

That is why he sits alone;
  And he hears a voice within,
Louder than the Robin's note,
  Crying, "Harry, this is sin!"

Then put back the nest, my boy,
  So you will be glad and free,
Nor will hasten by in shame,
  When you pass that withered tree.




GOD LOVES US.


[Illustration: Letter H.]

"How beautiful it is, mamma,
  That God should love us all;
That He should listen to their prayer,
  When little children call!

"What shall I do for him, mamma?
  For He's so kind to me,--
How shall I show my love to Him
  Who made bird, flower and tree?"

"The only thing which you can do
  Is this, my darling child,
Be always gentle, full of love,
  In words and actions mild.

"Thus you will show your love to God
  Who is so kind to you;
And you will live with Him at last
  In His bright heaven, too."

THE STORY OF MOSES.


[Illustration: Letter T.]

"Tell me a Sunday story,"
  A dear child said to me;
And I bent down and kissed her
  And placed her on my knee.

"Once, long ago, in countries
  Far, very far away,
Where the cold snow-storm never comes,
  And all is bright and gay,

"There lived a king, so cruel,
  He gave this stern command,
That all the little children
  Must die, throughout the land.

"But still there was one mother
  Who kept her baby dear,
And quickly hushed its crying,
  In silence and in fear;

"But when she could no longer
  Her precious baby hide,
She did not like to throw him
  Upon the rushing tide;

"And so a little basket
  She made, of rushes stout,
And plastered it with clay and pitch
  To keep the water out.

"Then in this basket-cradle
  She put the little child;
And quietly he floated down
  Among the rushes wild.

"Just then the king's own daughter
  Came to the water's edge,
And saw the basket floating
  Among the grass and sedge.

"She drew it from the water,
  And called the babe her own,
And kept him till to be a man
  That little boy had grown.

"And when you read the Bible,--
  Which you will learn to do,--
You'll see how great and good he was,
  And how God loved him, too."

ANGER.


[Illustration: W.]

"When a child is cross and angry,
  Never must her voice be heard;
Only to herself most softly
  May she say this simple word,

"Lead us not into temptation;"
  That will angry thoughts remove,
Make her calm and still and gentle,
  With a spirit full of love.




WHAT THE BIRDS SAY.


[Illustration]

"I hear the birds sing, mother,
  Yet know not what they say;
I've listened to them often
  Until they flew away.

"Say if their words, dear mother,
  To you are clear and plain,
Or if, like me, you've listened
  At morn and night in vain."

"We don't know what they say, dear;
  We think they sing their hymn
At early morning sunrise,
  Or at the twilight dim.

"When softly sings the mother,
  Within her downy nest,
We think she's gently hushing
  Her little ones to rest.

"But this remember, darling,
  The birds are always kind;
A cross or angry songster
  I never yet could find.

"And you may learn a lesson
  From their sweet notes of love;
Like them be always gentle,
  And please the God above."

THE MONKEY.


[Illustration: Letter O.]

"O Mother! here's the organ-man,
  And here's the monkey, too!
Just see his funny gown of red,
  And little cap of blue!

"O look! he's on the window there!
  His cap is in his paw;
And now he bows and makes a face;
  What can it all be for?

"O, now they've dropped some money in,
  While, quickly as he can,
See! he puts on his cap, and gives
  The pennies to the man.

"Mamma! why don't you look at him!
  You have not seen at all;
Just see him climbing up and down,
  With paws so brown and small!

"He's gone away! O, dear mamma,
  Why did you not come here?
You never saw, in all your life,
  A thing one half as queer."

"I'll tell you why, my little son,
  I do not like to see
That monkey bow and jump about;
