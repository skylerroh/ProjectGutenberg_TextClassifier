
"I WILL ARISE AND GO TO MY FATHER."

    Help me, O God, to trust in thee,
      Thou high and holy One!
    And may my troubled spirit flee
      For rest to thee alone.

    In thee alone the soul can find
      Secure and sweet repose;
    And thou canst bid the desert mind
      To blossom as the rose.

    Let not this spirit, formed to rise
      Where angels claim their birth,
    Forsake its home beyond the skies,
      And cling to barren earth.

    The bird of passage knows the sign
      That warns him to depart;
    Shall I not heed the voice divine,
      That whispers in my heart,--

    "Up! plume thy wings, soar far away!
      No longer idly roam!
    Fly to the realms of endless day;
      For this is not thy home."

    This still, small voice, O, may I hear!
      Ere clouds and darkness come,
    And thunders in my startled ear
      Proclaim my final doom.

    Father! to thee my spirit cries!
      Thy wandering child reclaim.
    Speak! and my dying faith shall rise,
      And wake a deathless flame.


EVENING HYMN.

    Thou, from whom we never part,
      Thou, whose love is everywhere,
    Thou who seest every heart,
      Listen to our evening prayer.

    Father! fill our souls with love,
      Love unfailing, full, and free,
    Love no injury can move,
      Love that ever rests on thee.

    Heavenly Father! through the night
      Keep us safe from every ill;
    Cheerful as the morning light,
      May we wake to do thy will.


AUTUMN.

    Sweet Summer, with her flowers, has past,
      I hear her parting knell;
    I hear the moaning, fitful blast,
      Sighing a sad farewell.

    But, while she fades and dies away,
      In rainbow hues she glows;
    Like the last smile of parting day,
      Still brightening as she goes.

    The robin whistles clear and shrill;
      Sad is the cricket's song;
    The wind, wild rushing o'er the hill,
      Bears the dead leaf along.

    I love this sober, solemn time,
      This twilight of the year;
    To me, sweet Spring, in all her prime,
      Was never half so dear.

    While death has set his changing seal
      On all that meets the eye,
    'Tis rapture, then, within to feel
      The soul that cannot die;--

    To look far, far beyond this sky,
      To Him who changes never.
    This earth, these heavens, shall change and die;
      God is the same for ever.


THE LORD'S DAY.

    This is the day when Jesus woke
      From the deep slumbers of the tomb;
    This is the day the Saviour broke
      The bonds of fear and hopeless gloom.

    This is indeed a holy day;
      No longer may we dread to die.
    Let every fear be cast away,
      And tears be wiped from every eye.

    Sorrow and pain the Saviour knew;
      A dark and thorny path he trod;
    But heaven was ever in his view,--
      That toilsome path led up to God.

    Let every heart rejoice and sing;
      Let every sin and sorrow cease;
    Let children come this day and bring
      Their offering of love and peace.


THE MINISTRY OF PAIN.

    Cease, my complaining spirit, cease;
      Know 'tis a Father's hand you feel;
    It leads you to the realms of peace;
      It kindly only wounds to heal.

    My Father! what a holy joy
      Bursts on the sad, desponding mind,
    To say, when fiercest ills annoy,--
      "I know my Father still is kind!"

    This bids each trembling fear be still,
      Checks every murmur, every sigh;
    Patience then waits his sovereign will,
      Rejoiced to live,--resigned to die.

    O blessed ministry of pain!
      To teach the soul its real worth;
    To lead it to that source again,
      From whence it first derived its birth.


"BY FAITH YE ARE SAVED."

    Christian! when, overwhelmed with grief and care,
      Thou prayest for the help that thou dost need,
      As shipwrecked mariner for life will plead,
    O, then for faith pour forth the fervent prayer!
    'Tis faith alone life's heavy ills can bear.
      O, mark her calm, far-seeing, quickening eye,
      Full of the light of immortality!
      It tells of worlds unseen, and calls us there;
      That look of hers can save thee from despair.

    When sorrow, like thick darkness, gathers round,
      And all life's flowers are fading in the dust,
    Faith lifts our drooping vision from the ground,--
      Says, that the hand that smites us yet is just;
    That human agony hath ever found
      The mighty God a never-failing trust.


EVENING PRAYER.

    Great Source of being,
    Father all-seeing!
    We bow before thee;
    Our souls adore thee;
    Help us obey thee;
    Guide us aright;
    Keep us, we pray thee,
    Through the long night.

    Thou kind, forgiving
    God of all living,
    Thy power defend us,
    Thy peace attend us,
    While we are closing
    This day in prayer,
    Ever reposing
    Under thy care.


EVENING HYMN.

    Before I close my eyes to-night,
      Let me myself these questions ask:--
    Have I endeavoured to do right,
      Nor thought my duty was a task?

    Have I been gentle, lowly, meek,
      And the small voice of conscience heard?
    When passion tempted me to speak,
      Have I repressed the angry word?

    Have I with cheerful zeal obeyed
      What my kind parents bid me do,
    And not by word or action said
      The thing that was not strictly true?

    In hard temptation's troubled hour,
      Then have I stopped to think and pray,
    That God would give my soul the power
      To chase the sinful thought away?

    O Thou who seest all my heart,
      Wilt thou forgive and love me still!
    Wilt thou to me new strength impart,
      And make me love to do thy will!


LINES WRITTEN AT MIDNIGHT.

TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN OF A.G. EBERHARD.

    The sun in smiles doth dress his face,
    As evening comes to take his place;
    So looks the parting loved-one, when
    He means to quickly come again.

    With moon and stars all sparkling bright,
    Advances now the silent night;
    And with the calm and gentle moon,
    Sweet peace doth quietly come on.

    Who at the moon and stars can gaze
    Without a gush of love and praise?
    And now it is the midnight hour,
    And sleep asserts her soothing power.

    But see, the flickering light is gone,
    That from my neighbour's window shone;
    His simple household prayer is said,
    He rests from toil, on his hard bed.

    Yet still the watchman wakes, and still
    Faithful till morning watch he will;
    But vain, O watchman! is thy care,
    If God, the Guardian, be not there.

    By my dull lamp, whose light's near gone,
    In my small room I sit alone,
    And, thinking o'er past joys and pain,
    A sweet contentment doth remain.

    He's still my trust; he, the true Shepherd, never
    Will forsake his sheep,--he watcheth ever;
    The mother may forget her child, but yet
    Thus saith the Lord,--"Thee I will not forget."

    I rest in peace, I trust in Thee;
    Thy faithful eye still watcheth me;
    For He who ever wakes and lives
    To loving hearts no night e'er gives.


"HOPE IN GOD."

TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN OF S.A. MAHLMAN.

    Hope, my heart, in patience hope,--
      Thou at last thy flowers shalt gather;
    God is full of tender love,--
      Childlike speak thou to thy Father.
    From believing, trusting hearts,
    The God of mercy ne'er departs.

    Clouds may come, and clouds may go,
      Rest upon his goodness always;
    To those joyful, sunny heights
      Lead these rough and gloomy pathways;
    Wakes for aye his Eye of Light,--
    Tremble not in storm and night.

    Anchored on the Eternal Rock,
      To the heart of God fast clinging,
    Tell him all thy deepest woes,
      Before him all thy sorrows bringing;
    He is kind, and comfort gives
    To every sorrowing heart that lives.

    Let true faith strong courage give;
      Strength the Helper now is sending;
    Soon thou'lt understand His ways,
      Soon thou'lt find thy sorrows ending.
    God! who life and goodness art!
    In patience hope in Him, my heart.


FAILURE AND SUCCESS.

    It is in failure, in distress,
      When, reft of all, it stands alone,
    And not in what men call success,
      The noble, valiant soul is known.

    He who perfection makes his aim
      Shoots at a mark he may not reach;
    The world may laugh, the world may blame.
      And what it calls _discretion_ preach.

    And he will fail to win the goal
      Which low ambition makes its own;
    But, far beyond, his earnest soul
      Stands in the light, though all alone.

    It was through insult, pain, and loss
      That Jesus won immortal power;
    Thus the great failure of the cross
      Was his triumphant, glorious hour.

    Think not of failure or success;
      He fails who has a low desire.
    Up to the highest ever press,
      Still onward, upward, higher! higher!

    Make such thy purpose, such thy aim,
      That they who watch thy spirit's flight
    Shall look to heaven from whence it came,
      And loose thee in celestial light.




SONGS.


THE LITTLE SPRING.

    Beneath a green and mossy bank
      There flows a clear and fairy stream;
    There the pert squirrel oft has drank,
      And thought, perhaps, 'twas made for him.

    Their pitchers there the laborers fill,
      As drop by drop the crystals flow,
    Singing their silvery welcome still
      To all who to the fountain go.

    Then to the river on it glides,
      Its tributary drop to bear,
    Its modest head a moment hides,
      Then rises up and sparkles there.

    The touching lesson on my heart
      Falls like the gentle dews of heaven,
    Bids me with humble love impart
      The little treasure God has given.

    For from a source as small as this
      Full many a cup of joy may flow,
    And on the stream of human bliss
      Its little ray of gladness throw.


THE LITTLE BOY'S MAY-DAY SONG.

    "The flowers are blooming everywhere,
      On every hill and dell,
    And O, how beautiful they are!
      How sweetly, too, they smell!

    "The little brooks, they dance along,
      And look so glad and gay;
    I love to hear their pleasant song,
      I feel as glad as they.
