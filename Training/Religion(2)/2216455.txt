  It makes our burdens light:
'Twill serve our drooping hearts to cheer,
  Till faith shall end in sight:--

4 Till, of the prize possessed,
  We hear of war no more;
And ever with our Leader rest,
  On yonder peaceful shore.

_The Sacrifices of Warfare._     (751)

Am I a soldier of the cross,
  A follower of the Lamb?
And shall I fear to own his cause,
  Or blush to speak his name?

2 Must I be carried to the skies
  On flow'ry beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
  And sailed thro' bloody seas?

3 Are there no foes for me to face?
  Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
  To help me on to God?

4 Sure I must fight if I would reign;
  Increase my courage, Lord;
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
  Supported by thy word.

5 Thy saints in all this glorious war,
  Shall conquer, though they die;
They see the triumph from afar,
  By faith they bring it nigh.

6 When that illustrious day shall rise,
  And all thy armies shine
In robes of vict'ry through the skies,
  The glory shall be thine.

_Christian Soldiers._     (773)

Soldiers of Christ are we
Marching to victory,
  Marching to heaven;
In his bright armor dressed,
His cross our chosen crest,
And for our food and rest,
  His word is given.

2 Tho' foes our path surround,
Tho' toils and cares abound,
  Onward we tread;
We hear our Lord's command;
We grasp each shining brand,
And, like a banner grand,
  Hope waves o'erhead.

3 Soldiers of Christ are we,
Light, Love, and Liberty
  Our battle call!
Till truth shall win the day,
Till right shall gain the sway,
Till sin is driven away,
  We fight or fall.


428     Webb. 7s & 6s.

     (771)

Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
  Ye soldiers of the cross!
Lift high his royal banner,
  It must not suffer loss;
From victory unto victory
  His army shall he lead,
Till every foe is vanquished.
  And Christ is Lord indeed.

2 Stand up, stand up for Jesus.
  The trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict,
  In this his glorious day;
Ye that are men! now serve him,
  Against unnumbered foes;
Your courage rise with danger,
  And strength to strength oppose.

3 Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
  Stand in his strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you;
  Ye dare not trust your own;
Put on the gospel armor,
  And, watching unto prayer,
Where duty calls, or danger,
  Be never wanting there.

4 Stand up, stand up for Jesus:
  The strife will not be long;
This day, the noise of battle,--
  The next, the victor's song;
To him that overcometh,
  A crown of life shall be;
He, with the King of glory,
  Shall reign eternally!

_Psalm 27._     (772)

God is my strong salvation;
  What foe have I to fear?
In darkness and temptation,
  My Light, my Help is near:
Though hosts encamp around me,
  Firm to the fight I stand;
What terror can confound me,
  With God at my right hand?

2 Place on the Lord reliance;
  My soul! with courage wait;
His truth be thine affiance,
  When faint and desolate;
His might thy heart shall strengthen,
  His love thy joy increase;
Mercy thy days shall lengthen;
  The Lord will give thee peace.

     James Montgomery, 1822.


430     Yield Not to Temptation. P.M.

_Courage._

Yield not to temptation,
  For yielding is sin;
Each vict'ry will help you
  Some other to win.
Fight manfully onward,
  Dark passions subdue;
Look ever to Jesus,
  He'll carry you through.

Cho.--Ask the Savior to help you,
      Comfort, strengthen, and keep you;
      He is willing to aid you,
      He will carry you through.

2 Shun evil companions,
  Bad language disdain,
God's name hold in rev'rence,
  Nor take it in vain;
Be thoughtful and earnest,
  Kind-hearted and true;
Look ever to Jesus,
  He'll carry you through.

3 To him that o'ercometh,
  God giveth a crown;
Through faith we shall conquer,
  Though often cast down;
He who is our Savior
  Our strength will renew;
Look ever to Jesus,
  He'll carry you through.

_Founded on a Rock._     (892)

With stately towers and bulwarks strong,
  Unrivaled and alone,
Loved theme of many a sacred song;
  God's holy city shone.

2 Thus fair was Zion's chosen seat,
  The glory of all lands;
Yet fairer and in strength complete,
  The Christian temple stands.

3 The faithful of each clime and age
  This glorious church compose;
Built on a Rock, with idle rage
  The threat'ning tempest blows.

4 Fear not; though hostile bands alarm,
  Thy God is thy defense;
And weak and powerless every arm
  Against Omnipotence.

_The Church Immovable._     (891)

Oh! where are kings and empires now,
  Of old that went and came?
But, Lord! thy church is praying yet,
  A thousand years the same.

2 We mark her goodly battlements,
  And her foundations strong;
We hear within the solemn voice
  Of her unending song.

3 For, not like kingdoms of the world,
  Thy holy church, O God!
Though earthquake shocks are threatening her,
  And tempests are abroad;

4 Unshaken as eternal hills,
  Immovable she stands,
A mountain that shall fill the earth,
  A house not made by hands.

_Returning to Zion._     (894)

Daughter of Zion, from the dust
  Exalt thy fallen head;
Again in thy Redeemer trust--
  He calls thee from the dead.

2 Awake, awake, put on thy strength,
  Thy beautiful array;
The day of freedom dawns at length--
  The Lord's appointed day.

3 Rebuild thy walls, thy bounds enlarge,
  And send thy heralds forth;
Say to the South, Give up thy charge!
  And, Keep not back, O North!

4 They come, they come; thine exiled bands,
  Where'er they rest or roam,
Have heard thy voice in distant lands,
  And hasten to their home.

_Little Flock._

Church of the ever-living God,
  The Father's gracious choice,
Amid the voices of this earth
  How feeble is thy voice!

2 Not many rich or noble called,
  Not many great or wise:
They whom God makes his kings and priests
  Are poor in human eyes.

3 But the chief Shepherd comes at length;
  Their feeble days are o'er,
No more a handful in the earth,
  A little flock no more.

I love thy kingdom, Lord!
  The house of thine abode,
The church our blest Redeemer saved,
  With his own precious blood.

2 I love thy church, O God!
  Her walls before thee stand,
Dear as the apple of thine eye,
  And graven on thy hand.

3 For her my tears shall fall,
  For her my prayers ascend;
To her my cares and toils be given,
  Till toils and cares shall end.

4 Beyond my highest joy
  I prize her heavenly ways,
Her sweet communion, solemn vows,
  Her hymns of love and praise.

5 Sure as thy truth shall last,
  To Zion shall be given
The brightest glories earth can yield,
  And brighter bliss of heaven.

_A Revival Sought._     (912)

Revive thy work, O Lord!
  Thy mighty arm make bare;
Speak, with the voice that wakes the dead,
  And make thy people hear.

2 Revive thy work, O Lord!
  Disturb this sleep of death;
Quicken the smoldering embers now,
  By thine almighty breath.

3 Revive thy work, O Lord!
  Exalt thy precious name;
And, by the Holy Ghost, our love
  For thee and thine inflame.

4 Revive thy work, O Lord!
  And give refreshing showers;
The glory shall be all thine own,
  The blessing, Lord! be ours.

Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
Does his successive journeys run;
His kingdom spread from shore to shore,
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

2 From north to south the princes meet,
To pay their homage at his feet;
While western empires own their Lord,
And savage tribes attend his word.

3 To him shall endless prayer be made,
And endless praises crown his head;
His name, like sweet perfume, shall rise,
With every morning sacrifice.

4 People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on his love with sweetest song,
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on his name.

5 Blessings abound where'er he reigns;
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains;
The weary find eternal rest,
And all the sons of want are blest.

6 Let every creature rise and bring
Peculiar honors to our King;
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth repeat the loud Amen!

Triumphant Zion! lift thy head
From dust, and darkness, and the dead;
Though humbled long, awake at length,
And gird thee with thy Savior's strength.

2 Put all thy beauteous garments on,
And let thy various charms be known;
The world thy glories shall confess,
Decked in the robes of righteousness.

3 No more shall foes unclean invade,
And fill thy hallowed walls with dread;
No more shall hell's insulting host
Their vict'ry and thy sorrows boast.

4 God, from on high, thy groans will hear;
His hand thy ruins shall repair;
Nor will thy watchful Monarch cease
To guard thee in eternal peace.

Soon may the last glad song arise
Through all the millions of the skies--
That song of triumph which records
That all the earth is now the Lord's!

2 Let thrones and powers and kingdoms be
Obedient, mighty God, to thee!
And, over land and stream and main,
Wave thou the scepter of thy reign!

3 Oh, let that glorious anthem swell,
Let host to host the triumph tell,
That not one rebel heart remains,
But over all the Savior reigns!

Zion stands with hills surrounded,
  Zion kept by power divine!
All her foes shall be confounded,
  Tho' the world in arms combine.
    Happy Zion,
  What a favored lot is thine!

2 Ev'ry human tie may perish,
  Friend to friend unfaithful prove,
Mothers cease their own to cherish,
  Heaven and earth at last remove;
    But no changes
  Can attend Jehovah's love.

3 In the furnace God may prove thee,
  Thence to bring thee forth more bright,
But can never cease to love thee--
  Thou art precious in his sight:
    God is with thee--
  God, thine everlasting light.

On the mountain's top appearing,
  Lo! the sacred herald stands,
Welcome news to Zion bearing--
  Zion long in hostile lands:
    Mourning captive!
  God himself shall loose thy bands.

2 Has thy night been long and mournful?
  Have thy friends unfaithful proved?
Have thy foes been proud and scornful?
  By thy sighs and tears unmoved?
    Cease thy mourning;
  Zion still is well beloved.

3 God, thy God, will now restore thee;
  He himself appears thy Friend;
All thy foes shall flee before thee;
  Here their boasts and triumph end;
    Great deliverance
  Zion's King will surely send.

_Prayer for a Revival._     (923)

Savior, visit thy plantation;
  Grant us, Lord, a gracious rain;
All will come to desolation,
  Unless thou return again.
    Lord, revive us!
  All our help must come from thee.

2 Keep no longer at a distance;
  Shine upon us from on high,
Lest, for want of thine assistance,
  Every plant should droop and die.
    Lord, revive us!
  All our help must come from thee.

3 Let our mutual love be fervent!
  Make us prevalent in prayers;
Let each one, esteemed thy servant,
  Shun the world's bewitching snares.
    Lord, revive us!
  All our help must come from thee.

4 Break the tempter's fatal power,
  Turn the stony heart to flesh,
And begin, from this good hour,
  To revive thy work afresh.
    Lord, revive us!
  All our help must come from thee.

Glorious things of thee are spoken,
  Zion, city of our God!
He, whose word cannot be broken,
  Formed thee for his own abode;
On the Rock of Ages founded,
  What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation's walls surrounded,
  Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.

2 See! the streams of living waters,
  Springing from eternal love,
Well supply thy sons and daughters,
  And all fear of want remove;
Who can faint, while such a river,
  Ever flows their thirst t' assuage?--
Grace, which, like the Lord, the Giver,
  Never fails from age to age.

3 Round each habitation hovering,
  See the cloud and tire appear,
For a glory and a covering,
  Showing that the Lord is near!
Thus deriving from their banner,
  Light by night, and shade by day,
Safe they feed upon the manna
  Which he gives them when they pray.

  'Mid thy follies and thy woes!
Soon repenting and returning,
  All thy solitude shall close.

2 Though benighted and forsaken,
  Though afflicted and distressed;
His almighty arm shall waken;
  Zion's King shall give thee rest:
Cease thy sadness, unbelieving;
  Soon his glory shalt thou see!
Joy and gladness, and thanksgiving,
  And the voice of melody!

Onward, onward, men of heaven
  Bear the gospel's banner high;
Rest not, till its light is given,
  Star of every pagan sky:
Send it where the pilgrim stranger
  Paints beneath the torrid ray;
