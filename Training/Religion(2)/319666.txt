and its salutary influence on yourself and others.

You must feel and know that God alone governs man;
that His government is harmonious; that He is too pure          6
to behold iniquity, and divides His power with nothing
evil or material; that material laws are only human be-
liefs, which govern mortals wrongfully. These beliefs arise     9
from the subjective states of thought, producing the be-
liefs of a mortal material universe, -- so-called, and of
material disease and mortality.  Mortal ills are but errors     12
of thought, -- diseases of mortal mind, and not of matter;
for matter cannot feel, see, or report pain or disease,

Disease is a thing of thought manifested on the body;           15
and fear is the procurator of the thought which causes
sickness and suffering. Remove this fear by the true
sense that God is Love, -- and that Love punishes nothing       18
but sin, -- and the patient can then look up to the loving
God, and know that He afflicteth not willingly the children
of men, who are punished because of disobedience to His         21
spiritual law.  His law of Truth, when obeyed, removes
every erroneous physical and mental state.  The belief
that matter can master Mind, and make you ill, is an            24
error which Truth will destroy.

You must learn to acknowledge God in all His ways.
It is only a lack of understanding of the allness of God,       27
which leads you to believe in the existence of matter, or
that matter can frame its own conditions, contrary to the       1
law of Spirit.

Sickness is the schoolmaster, leading you to Christ;            3
first to faith in Christ; next to belief in God as omnipo-
tent; and finally to the _understanding_ of God and man
in Christian Science, whereby you learn that God is good,       6
and in Science man is His likeness, the forever reflection of
goodness.  Therefore good is one and All.

This brings forward the next proposition in Christian           9
Science, -- namely, that there are no sickness, sin, and
death in the divine Mind.  What seem to be disease, vice,
and mortality are illusions of the physical senses.  These      12
illusions are not real, but unreal.  Health is the conscious-
ness of the unreality of pain and disease; or, rather, the
absolute consciousness of harmony and of nothing else.          15
In a moment you may awake from a night-dream; just
so you can awake from the dream of sickness; but the
demonstration of the Science of Mind-healing by no means        18
rests on the strength of human belief.  This demonstra-
tion is based on a true understanding of God and divine
Science, which takes away every human belief, and,              21
through the illumination of spiritual understanding, re-
veals the all-power and ever-presence of good, whence
emanate health, harmony, and Life eternal.                      24

The lecturer, teacher, or healer who is indeed a Christian
Scientist, never introduces the subject of human anatomy;
never depicts the muscular, vascular, or nervous opera-         27
tions of the human frame.   He never talks about the
structure of the material body. He never lays his hands         1
on the patient, nor manipulates the parts of the body sup-
posed to be ailing. Above all, he keeps unbroken the Ten        3
Commandments, and practises Christ's Sermon on the
Mount.

Wrong thoughts and methods strengthen the sense of              6
disease, instead of cure it; or else quiet the fear of the
sick on false grounds, encouraging them in the belief of
error until they hold stronger than before the belief that      9
they are first made sick by matter, and then restored
through its agency. This fosters infidelity, and is mental
quackery, that denies the Principle of Mind-healing.  If        12
the sick are aided in this mistaken fashion, their ailments
will return, and be more stubborn because the relief is
unchristian and unscientific.                                   15

Christian Science erases from the minds of invalids
their mistaken belief that they live in or because of matter,
or that a so-called material organism controls the health       18
or existence of mankind, and induces rest in God, divine
Love, as caring for all the conditions requisite for the well-
being of man.  As power divine is the healer, why should        21
mortals concern themselves with the chemistry of food?
Jesus said: "Take no thought what ye shall eat."

The practitioner should also endeavor to free the minds         24
of the healthy from any sense of subordination to their
bodies, and teach them that the divine Mind, not material
law, maintains human health and life.                           27

A Christian Scientist knows that, in Science, disease
is unreal; that Mind is not in matter; that Life is God,        1
good; hence Life is not functional, and is neither matter
nor mortal mind; knows that pantheism and theosophy             3
are not Science.  Whatever saps, with human belief,
this basis of Christian Science, renders it impossible to
demonstrate the Principle of this Science, even in the          6
smallest degree.

A mortal and material body is not the actual individuality
of man made in the divine and spiritual image of God.           9
The material body is not the likeness of Spirit; hence it
is not the truth of being, but the likeness of error ? the
human belief which saith there is more than one God, --         12
there is more than one Life and one Mind.

In Deuteronomy (iv. 35) we read:  "The Lord, He is
God; there is none else beside Him."  In John (iv. 24)          15
we may read: "God is Spirit."  These propositions, un-
derstood in their Science, elucidate my meaning.

When treating a patient, it is not Science to treat every       18
organ in the body.  To aver that harmony is the real and
discord is the unreal, and then give special attention to
what according to their own belief is diseased, is scientific;  21
and if the _healer realizes_ the truth, it will free his patient.

_What are the means and, methods of trustworthy Christian_
_Scientists?_                                                   24

These people should not be expected, more than others,
to give all their time to Christian Science work, receiving
no wages in return, but left to be fed, clothed, and sheltered  27
by charity.  Neither can they serve two masters, giving         1
only a portion of their time to God, and still be Christian
Scientists.  They must give Him all their services, and         3
"owe no man."  To do this, they must at present ask a
