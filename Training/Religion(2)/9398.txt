nor of the flourishing green plants, nor of the sheep, nor any one of
the things of which you told me.  Where are those sheep of thine you
told me to bless?"

2 Then Cain said to him, "Come on, and you shall see many beautiful
things very soon, but go before me, until I catch up to you."

3 Then went Abel forward, but Cain remained behind him.

4 And Abel was walking in his innocence, without guile; not believing
his brother would kill him.

5 Then Cain, when he came up to him, comforted him with his talk,
walking a little behind him; then he ran up to him and beat him with
the staff, blow after blow, until he was stunned.

6 But when Abel fell down on the ground, seeing that his brother meant
to kill him, he said to Cain, "O, my brother, have pity on me.  By the
breasts we have sucked, don't hit me!  By the womb that bore us and
that brought us into the world, don't beat me to death with that staff!
If you will kill me, take one of these large stones and kill me
outright."

7 Then Cain, the hard-hearted, and cruel murderer, took a large stone,
and beat his brother's head with it, until his brains oozed out, and he
wallowed in his blood, before him.

8 And Cain repented not of what he had done.

9 But the earth, when the blood of righteous Abel fell on it, trembled,
as it drank his blood, and would have destroyed Cain because of it.

10 And the blood of Abel cried mysteriously to God, to avenge him of
his murderer.

11 Then Cain began at once to dig the ground wherein to lay his
brother; for he was trembling from the fear that came over him, when he
saw the earth tremble on his account.

12 He then cast his brother into the pit he made, and covered him with
dust.  But the ground would not receive him; but it threw him up at
once.

13 Again Cain dug the ground and hid his brother in it; but again the
ground threw him up on itself; until three times the ground thus threw
up on itself the body of Abel.

14 The muddy ground threw him up the first time, because he was not the
first creation; and it threw him up the second time and would not
receive him, because he was righteous and good, and was killed without
a cause; and the ground threw him up the third time and would not
receive him, that there might remain before his brother a witness
against him.

15 And so the earth mocked Cain, until the Word of God, came to him
concerning his brother.

16 Then was God angry, and much displeased at Abel's death; and He
thundered from heaven, and lightnings went before Him, and the Word of
the Lord God came from heaven to Cain, and said to him, "Where is Abel
your brother?"

17 Then Cain answered with a proud heart and a gruff voice, "How, O
God?  Am I my brother's keeper?"

18 Then God said to Cain, "Cursed be the earth that has drunk the blood
of Abel your brother; and as for you, you will always be trembling and
shaking; and this will be a mark on you so that whoever finds you, will
kill you."

19 But Cain cried because God had said those words to him; and Cain
said to Him, "O God, whosoever finds me shall kill me, and I shall be
blotted out from the face of the earth."

20 Then God said to Cain, "Whoever finds you will not kill you;"
because before this, God had been saying to Cain, "I shall put seven
punishments on anyone that kills Cain." For as to the word of God to
Cain, "Where is your brother?" God said it in mercy for him, to try and
make him repent.

21 For if Cain had repented at that time, and had said, "O God, forgive
me my sin, and the murder of my brother,"  God would then have forgiven
him his sin.

22 And as to God saying to Cain, "Cursed be the ground that has drunk
the blood of your brother."  That also, was God's mercy on Cain.  For
God did not curse him, but He cursed the ground; although it was not
the ground that had killed Abel, and committed a wicked sin.

23 For it was fitting that the curse should fall on the murderer; yet
in mercy did God so manage His thoughts as that no one should know it,
and turn away from Cain.

24 And He said to him, "Where is your brother?" To which he answered
and said, "I know not." Then the Creator said to him, "Be trembling and
quaking."

25 Then Cain trembled and became terrified; and through this sign did
God make him an example before all the creation, as the murderer of his
brother.  Also did God bring trembling and terror over him, that he
might see the peace in which he was at first, and see also the
trembling and terror he endured at the last; so that he might humble
himself before God, and repent of his sin, and seek the peace that he
enjoyed at first.

26 And in the word of God that said, "I will put seven punishments on
anyone who  kills Cain," God was not seeking to kill Cain with the
sword, but He sought to make him die of fasting, and praying and crying
by hard rule, until the time that he was delivered from his sin.

27 And the seven punishments are the seven generations during which God
awaited Cain for the murder of his brother.

28 But as to Cain, ever since he had killed his brother, he could find
no rest in any place; but went back to Adam and Eve, trembling,
terrified, and defiled with blood. . . .

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
