           mele or oli and not merely to the filigree, the i'i, that
           enwreathed it.
[Page 161]
           It would follow from this, if the author is correct, that the
           musical critic of to-day must be content to generalize
           somewhat and must not be put out if the key is changed on
           repetition and if tempo and rhythm depart at times from their
           standard gait. It is questionable if even the experts in the
           palmy days of the hula attained such a degree of skill as to
           be faultless and logical in these matters.

           It has been said that modern music has molded and developed
           itself under the influence of three causes, (1) a
           comprehension of the nature of music itself, (2) a feeling or
           inspiration, and (3) the influence of poetry. Guided by this
           generalization, it may be said that Hawaiian poetry was the
           nurse and pedagogue of that stammering infant, Hawaiian
           music; that the words of the mele came before its rhythmic
           utterance in song; and that the first singers were the
           priests and the eulogists. Hawaiian poetry is far ahead of
           Hawaiian song in the power to move the feelings. A few words
           suffice the poet with which to set the picture before one's
           eyes, and one picture quickly follows another; whereas the
           musical attachment remains weak and colorless, reminding one
           of the nursery pictures, in which a few skeletal lines
           represent the human frame.

           Let us now for refreshment and in continued pursuit of our
           subject listen to a song in the language and spirit of
           old-time Hawaii, composed, however, in the middle of the
           nineteenth century. It is given as arranged by Miss Lillian
           Byington, who took it down as she heard it sung by an old
           Hawaiian woman in the train of Queen Liliuokalani, and as the
           author has since heard it sung by Miss Byington's pupils of
           the Kamehameha School for Girls. The song has been slightly
           idealized, perhaps, by trimming away some of the superfluous
           i'i, but not more than is necessary to make it highly
           acceptable to our ears and not so much as to take from it the
           plaintive bewitching tone that pervades the folk-music of
           Hawaii. The song, the mele, is not in itself much--a hint, a
           sketch, a sweep of the brush, a lilt of the imagination, a
           connotation of multiple images which no jugglery of literary
           art can transfer into any foreign speech. Its charm, like
           that of all folk-songs and of all romance, lies in its
           mysterious tug at the heartstrings.

           Hawaii. Arrived at Waipi'o in a famishing state, she climbed
           the heights and ate of the _ulei_ berries without first
           propitiating the local deity with a sacrifice. As an
           infliction of the offended deity, she became distraught and
           wandered away into the wilderness. Her husband repented of
           his neglect and after long search found her. Under kind
           treatment she regained her reason and the family was happily

                      _A Name-song of Kamehameha_

                In Waipi'o stands Paka'alana,
                The sacred shrine of Liloa.
                Love to the woman climbing the steep,
                Who gathered the ulei berries,
            5   Who ate of the uncooked herbs of the wild,      5
                Craving the swaying fruit like a hungry child.
                A covert I found from the storm,
                Life in my sea of delight.

           The text of this mele--said to be a name-song of Kamehameha
           V--as first secured had undergone some corruption which
           obscured the meaning. By calling to his aid an old Hawaiian
           in whose memory the song had long been stored the author was
           able to correct it. Hawaiian authorities are at variance as
           to its meaning. One party reads in it an exclusive allusion
           to characters that have flitted across the stage within the
           memory of people now living, while another, taking a more
           romantic and traditional view, finds in it a reference to an
           old-time myth--that of _Ke-anini-ula-o-ka-lani_--the chief
           character in which was _Haina-kolo_. (See note _e_.) After
           carefully considering both sides of the question it seems to
           the author that, while the principle of double allusion, so
           common in Hawaiian poetry, may here prevail, one is justified
           in giving prominence to the historico-mythological
           interpretation that is inwoven in the poem. It is a
           comforting thought that adhesion to this decision will suffer
           certain unstaged actions of crowned heads to remain in
           charitable oblivion.

           The music of this song is an admirable and faithful
           interpretation of the old Hawaiian manner of cantillation,
           having received at the hands of the foreign musician only so
           much trimming as was necessary to idealize it and make it
           reducible to our system of notation.


                                EXPLANATORY NOTE

           _Hoaeae_.--This term calls for a quiet, sentimental style of
           recitation, in which the fluctuating trill i'i, if it occurs
           at all, is not made prominent. It is contrasted with the
           _olioli_, in which the style is warmer and the fluctuations
           of the i'i are carried to the extreme.

           Thus far we have been considering the traditional indigenous
           music of the land. To come now to that which has been and is
           being produced in Hawaii by Hawaiians to-day, under
           influences from abroad, it will not be possible to mistake
           the presence in it of two strains: The foreign, showing its
           hand in the lopping away of much redundant foliage, has
           brought it largely within the compass of scientific and
           technical expression; the native element reveals itself, now
[Page 164] in plaintive reminiscence and now in a riotous _bonhommie_, a
           rollicking love of the sensuous, and in a style of delivery
           and vocal technique which demands a voluptuous throatiness,
           and which must be heard to be appreciated.

           The foreign influence has repressed and well-nigh driven from
           the field the monotonous fluctuations of the i'i, has lifted
           the starveling melodies of Hawaii out of the old ruts and
           enriched them with new notes, thus giving them a spring and
           _elan_ that appeal alike to the cultivated ear and to the
           popular taste of the day. It has, moreover, tapped the
           springs of folk-song that lay hidden in the Hawaiian nature.
           This same influence has also caused to germinate a Hawaiian
           appreciation of harmony and has endowed its music with new
           chords, the tonic and dominant, as well as with those of the
           subdominant and various minor chords.

           The persistence of the Hawaiian quality is, however, most
           apparent in the language and imagery of the song-poetry. This
           will be seen in the text of the various mele and oli now to
           be given. Every musician will also note for himself the
           peculiar intervals and shadings of these melodies as well as
           the odd effects produced by rhythmic syncopation.

           The songs must speak for themselves. The first song to be
           given, though dating from no longer ago than about the sixth
           decade of the last century, has already scattered its
           wind-borne seed and reproduced its kind in many variants,
           after the manner of other folklore. This love-lyric
           represents a type, very popular in Hawaii, that has continued
           to grow more and more personal and subjective in contrast
           with the objective epic style of the earliest Hawaiian mele.

           He who would translate this love-lyric for the ear as well as
           for the mind finds himself handicapped by the limitations of
           our English speech--its scant supply of those orotund vowel
           sounds which flow forth with their full freight of breath in
           such words as _a-lo-ha_, _po-li_, and _a-nu-a-nu_. These
           vocables belong to the very genius of the Hawaiian tongue.

                           _Cold Breast_

                1. Love fain compels to greet thee,
                Breast so cold, so cold.
                Chilled, benumbed am I
                With the pinching cold.

                2. How bitter cold the rainfall,
                Bitter cold the stream,
                Body all a-shiver,
                From the pinching cold.

                3. Pray, what think you?
                What if you and I
                Should our arms enfold,
                Just to keep off the cold?

           The song next given, dating from a period only a few years
           subsequent, is of the same class and general character as
           Poli Anuanu. Both words and music are peculiarly Hawaiian,
           though one may easily detect the foreign influence that
           presided over the shaping of the melody.

                In the middle watch of the night.

             2. This way is the path for thee and me,
                A welcome warm at the end.
                I waited long for thy coming,
                And found thee in waft of the breeze.

                _Chorus_.

           NOTE.--The composer of the music and the author of the mele
           was a Hawaiian named John Meha, of the Hawaiian Band, who
           died some ten years ago, at the age of 40 years.

           The author of the mele was a Hawaiian named John Meha, who
           died some years ago. He was for many years a member of the
           Hawaiian Band and set the words to the music given below,
           which has since been arranged by Captain Berger.

                          [Translation]

                         _Side by Side_

                1. Outspreads now the dawn,
                   Arching itself on high--
                   But look! a wondrous thing,
                   A thrill at touch of the side.

                   _Chorus_:

                   Most dear to the soul is a love-touch;
                   Its pulse stirs ever the heart
                   And gently throbs in the breast--
                   At thrill from the touch of the side.

                2. In time awakes a new charm
                   As you turn and gently caress;
                   Short comes, the breath--at
                   The thrill from the touch of the side.

                   _Chorus_.

           The fragments of Hawaiian music that have drifted down to us
           no doubt remain true to the ancient type, however much they
           may have changed in quality. They show the characteristics
           that stamp all primitive music--plaintiveness to the degree
           almost of sadness, monotony, lack of acquaintance with the
           full range of intervals that make up our diatonic scale, and
           therefore a measurable absence of that ear-charm we call
           melody. These are among its deficiencies.

           If, on the other hand, we set down the positive qualities by
           the possession of which it makes good its claim to be classed
           as music, we shall find that it has a firm hold on rhythm.
           This is indeed one of the special excellencies of Hawaiian
           music. Added to this, we find that it makes a limited use of
           such-intervals as the third, fifth, fourth, and at the same
           time resorts extravagantly, as if in compensation, to a fine
           tone-carving that divides up the tone-interval into fractions
           so much less than the semitone that our ears are almost
           indifferent to them, and are at first inclined to deny their
           existence. This minute division of the tone, or step, and
           neglect at the same time of the broader harmonic intervals,
           reminds one of work in which the artist charges his picture
           with unimportant detail, while failing in attention to the
           strong outlines. Among its merits we must not forget to
           mention a certain quality of tone-color which inheres in the
           Hawaiian tongue and which greatly tends to the enhancement of
           Hawaiian music, especially when thrown into rhythmic forms.

           The first thing, then, to repeat, that will strike the
           auditor on listening to this primitive music will be its lack
           of melody. The voice goes wavering and lilting along like a
           canoe on a rippling ocean.

[Page 171]
           Then, of a sudden, it swells upward, as if lifted by some
           wave of emotion; and there for a time it travels with the
           same fluctuating movement, soon descending to its old
           monotone, until again moved to rise on the breast of some
           fresh impulse. The intervals sounded may be, as already said,
           a third, or a fifth, or a fourth; but the whole movement
           leads nowhere; it is an unfinished sentence. Yet, in spite of
           all these drawbacks and of this childish immaturity, the
           amateur and enthusiast finds himself charmed and held as if
           in the clutch of some Old-World spell, and this at what
           others will call the dreary and monotonous intoning of the
           savage.

           In matters that concern the emotions it is rarely possible to
           trace with certainty the lines that lead up from effect to
           cause. Such is the nature of art. If we would touch the cause
           which lends attractiveness to Hawaiian music, we must look
           elsewhere than to melody. In the belief of the author the
           two elements that conspire for this end are rhythm and
           tone-color, which comes of a delicate feeling for
           vowel-values.

           The hall-mark of Hawaiian music is rhythm, for the Hawaiians
           belong to that class of people who can not move hand or foot
           or perform any action except they do it rhythmically. Not
           alone in poetry and music and the dance do we find this
           recurring accent of pleasure, but in every action of life it
           seems to enter as a timekeeper and regulator, whether it be
           the movement of a fingerful of poi to the mouth or the swing
           of a _kahili_ through the incense-laden air at the burial of
           a chief.

           The typical Hawaiian rhythm is a measure of four beats,
           varied at times by a 2-rhythm, or changed by syncopation into
           a 3-rhythm.

           These people have an emotional susceptibility and a sympathy
           with environment that belongs to the artistic temperament;
           but their feelings, though easily stirred, are not persistent
           and ideally centered; they readily wander away from any
           example or pattern. In this way may be explained their
           inclination to lapse from their own standard of rhythm into
           inexplicable syncopations.

           As an instance of sympathy with environment, an experience
           with a hula dancer may be mentioned. Wishing to observe the
           movement of the dance in time with the singing of the mele,
           the author asked him to perform the two at one time. He made
           the attempt, but failed. At length, bethinking himself, he
           drew off his coat and bound it about his loins after the
           fashion of a pa-u, such as is worn by hula dancers. He at
           once caught inspiration, and was thus enabled to perform the
           double role of dancer and singer.

           It has been often remarked by musical teachers who have had
           experience with these islanders that as singers they are
           prone to flat the tone and to drag the time, yet under the
           stimulus of emotion they show the ability to acquit
           themselves in these respects with great credit. The native
[Page 172] inertia of their being demands the spur of excitement to keep
           them up to the mark. While human nature everywhere shares in
           this weakness, the tendency seems to be greater in the
           Hawaiian than in some other races of no higher intellectual
           and esthetic advancement.

           Another quality of the Hawaiian character which reenforces
           this tendency is their spirit of communal sympathy. That is
           but another way of saying that they need the stimulus of the
           crowd, as well as of the occasion, even to make them keep
           step to the rhythm of their own music. In all of these points
           they are but an epitome of humanity.

           Before closing this special subject, the treatment of which
           has grown to an unexpected length, the author feels
           constrained to add one more illustration of Hawaii's musical
           productions. The Hawaiian national hymn on its poetical side
           may be called the last appeal of royalty to the nation's
