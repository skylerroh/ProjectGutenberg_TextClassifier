      When brightly shines the prosperous day,
    Be thoughts of thee a cloudy screen,
      To temper the deceitful ray!

4   And O, when gathers on our path,
      In shade and storm, the frequent night,
    Be thou, long-suffering, slow to wrath,
      A burning and a shining light!

Watchfulness.


1   I want a principle within
      Of jealous, godly fear;
    A sensibility of sin,
      A pain to find it near.

2   I want the first approach to feel
      Of pride, or fond desire;
    To catch the wandering of my will,
      And quench the kindling fire.

3   From thee that I no more may part,
      No more thy goodness grieve,
    The filial awe, the fleshly heart,
      The tender conscience give.

4   Quick as the apple of the eye,
      O God, my conscience make!
    Awake my soul when sin is nigh,
      And keep it still awake.

For Prudence and Wisdom.


1   Father of light! conduct my feet
      Through life's dark, dangerous road;
    Let each advancing step still bring
      Me nearer to my God.

2   Let heaven-eyed prudence be my guide;
      And, when I go astray,
    Recall my feet from folly's path
      To wisdom's better way.

3   Teach me in every various scene
      To keep my end in sight;
    And while I tread life's mazy track,
      Let wisdom guide me right.

4   That heavenly wisdom from above
      Abundantly impart;
    And let it guard, and guide, and warm,
      And penetrate my heart:

5   Till it shall lead me to thyself,
      Fountain of bliss and love!
    And all my darkness be dispersed
      In endless light above.

Heaven Desired.


1   The bird let loose in Eastern skies,
      Returning fondly home,
    Ne'er stoops to earth her wing, nor flies
      Where idle warblers roam.

2   But high she shoots through air and light--
      Above all low delay,
    Where nothing earthly bounds her flight,
      Nor shadow dims her way.

3   So grant me, God, from every snare
      Of sinful passion free,
    Aloft through faith's serener air
      To hold my course to thee.

4   No sin to cloud, no lure to stay
      My soul, as home she springs;
    Thy sunshine on her joyful way,
      Thy freedom on her wings.

The Mercy-seat.


1   From every stormy wind that blows,
    From every swelling tide of woes,
    There is a calm, a sure retreat;
    'Tis found before the mercy-seat.

2   There is a place were Jesus sheds
    The oil of gladness on our heads,--
    A place of all on earth most sweet;
    It is the heavenly mercy-seat.

3   There is a scene where spirits blend,
    Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
    Though sundered far, by faith they meet
    Around one common mercy-seat.

4   There, there, on eagle wings we soar,
    And sin and sense molest no more;
    And heaven comes down our souls to greet,
    And glory crowns the mercy-seat.

Thirsting after God.


1   When fainting in the sultry waste,
      And parched with thirst extreme,
    The weary pilgrim longs to taste
      The cool, refreshing stream.

2   So longs the weary, fainting mind,
      Oppressed with sins and woes,
    Some soul-reviving spring to find,
      Whence heavenly comfort flows.

3   O, may I thirst for thee, my God,
      With ardent, strong desire;
    And still, through all this desert road,
      To taste thy grace aspire.

4   Then shall my prayer to thee ascend,
      A grateful sacrifice;
    My mourning voice thou wilt attend,
      And grant me full supplies.

Self-Distrust.


1   'T  is a point I long to know,--
      Oft it causes anxious thought,--
    Do I love the Lord, or no?
      Am I his, or am I not?

2   If I love, why am I thus?
      Why this dull and lifeless frame?
    Hardly, sure, can they be worse,
      Who have never heard his name.

3   If I pray, or hear, or read,
      Sin is mixed with all I do;
    You that love the Lord indeed,
      Tell me, is it thus with you?

4   Yet I mourn my stubborn will,
      Find my sin a grief and thrall;
    Should I grieve for what I feel,
      If I did not love at all?

5   Father, let me love thee more,
      If I love at all, I pray;
    If I have not loved before,
      Help me to begin to-day.

Choosing the Better Part.


1   Beset with snares on every hand,
    In life's uncertain path I stand:
    Father divine! diffuse thy light,
    To guide my doubtful footsteps right.

2   Engage this roving, treacherous heart,
    Wisely to choose the better part;
    To scorn the trifles of a day,
    For joys that none can take away.

3   Then let the wildest storms arise,
    Let tempests mingle earth with skies,
    No fatal shipwreck shall I fear,
    But all my treasures with me bear.

4   If thou, my Saviour, still be nigh,
    Cheerful I live, and joyful die;
    Secure, when mortal comforts flee,
    To find ten thousand worlds in thee.




456.              C. M.                     Watts.

Sincerity and Hypocrisy.


1   God is a spirit just and wise,
      He sees our inmost mind;
    In vain to heaven we raise our cries,
      And leave our souls behind.

2   Nothing but truth before his throne
      With honor can appear;
    The painted hypocrites are known
      Through the disguise they wear.

3   Their lifted eyes salute the skies,
      Their bending knees the ground;
    But God abhors the sacrifice
      Where not the heart is found.

4   Lord, search my thoughts, and try my ways,
      And make my soul sincere;
    Then shall I stand before thy face,
      And find acceptance there.

    To serve the Lord with filial fear,
      With loving gratitude;
    Superior sense may I display,
    By shunning every evil way,
      And walking in the good.

2   O may I still from sin depart!
    A wise and understanding heart,
      Father, to me be given!
    And let me through thy Spirit know
    To glorify my God below,
      And find my way to heaven.

For the Understanding and Influence of God's Word.


1   While here as wandering sheep we stray,
    Teach us, O teach us, Lord, thy way!
    Dispose our hearts, with willing awe,
    To love thy word, to keep thy law;
    That, by thy guiding precepts led,
    Our feet the paths of truth may tread.

2   Great Source of light to all below!
    Teach us thy holy will to know:
    Teach us to read thy word aright,
    And make it our supreme delight;
    That, purged from vain desires, our mind
    In thee its only good may find.

3   Maker, instructer, judge of all,
    O hear us when on thee we call!
    To us, all-bounteous Lord, dispense
    Thy grace, and guiding influence!
    Preserve us in thy holy ways,
    And teach our hearts to speak thy praise!

Solomon's Prayer for Wisdom.


1   Almighty God! in humble prayer
      To thee our souls we lift;
    Do thou our waiting minds prepare
      For thy most needful gift.

2   We ask not golden streams of wealth
      Along our path to flow;
    We ask not undecaying health,
      Nor length of years below.

3   We ask not honors, which an hour
      May bring and take away;
    We ask not pleasure, pomp, and power,
      Lest we should go astray.

4   We ask for wisdom;--Lord, impart
      The knowledge how to live;
    A wise and understanding heart
      To all before thee give.

5   The young remember thee in youth,
      Before the evil days!
    The old be guided by thy truth
      In wisdom's pleasant ways!

Walking with God.


1   O, for a closer walk with God!
      A calm and heavenly frame!
    A light to shine upon the road
      That leads me to the Lamb!

2   What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!
      How sweet their memory still!
    But now I find an aching void
      The world can never fill.

3   Return, O holy Dove, return,
      Sweet messenger of rest;
    I hate the sins that made thee mourn,
      And drove thee from my breast.

4   The dearest idol I have known,
      Whate'er that idol be,
    Help me to tear it from thy throne,
      And worship only thee.

For Freedom from Secret Sin.


1   Searcher of hearts! before thy face
      I all my soul display;
    And, conscious of its innate arts,
      Entreat thy strict survey.

2   If, lurking in its inmost folds,
      I any sin conceal,
    O, let a ray of light divine
      The secret guile reveal.

3   If tinctured with that odious gall
      Unknowing I remain,
    Let grace, like a pure silver stream,
      Wash out the hateful stain.

4   If, in these fatal fetters bound,
      A wretched slave I lie,
    Smite off my chains, and wake my soul
      To light and liberty.

5   To humble penitence and prayer
      Be gentle pity given;
    Speak ample pardon to my heart,
      And seal its claim to heaven.

Self-abandonment to God.


1     Lord! bring me to resign
      My doubting heart to thee;
    And, whether cheerful or distressed,
      Thine, thine alone to be.

2     My only aim be this,--
      Thy purpose to fulfil,
    In thee rejoice with all my strength,
      And do thy holy will.

3     Lord! thy all-seeing eye
      Keeps watch with sleepless care:
    Thy great compassion never fails;
      Thou hear'st my needy prayer.

4     So will I firmly trust,
      That thou wilt guide me still,
    And guard me safe throughout the way
      That leads to Zion's hill.

Religious Retirement.


1   Far from the world, O Lord! I flee,
      From strife and tumult far;
    From scenes, where sin is waging still
      Its most successful war.

2   The calm retreat, the silent shade,
      With prayer and praise agree;
    And seem, by thy sweet bounty, made
      For those who follow thee.

3   There, if thy spirit touch the soul,
      And grace her mean abode;
    O with what peace, and joy, and love,
      She communes with her God.

4   There, like the nightingale, she pours
      Her solitary lays;
    Nor asks a witness of her song,
      Nor thirsts for human praise.

5   Author and Guardian of my life,

Silent Worship.


1   Let deepest silence all around
      Its peaceful shelter spread;
    So shall the living word abound,
      The word that wakes the dead.

2   How sweet to wait upon the Lord
      In stillness and in prayer!
    What though no preacher speak the word
      A minister is there:

3   He knows to bend the heart of steel,
      He bows the loftiest soul;
    O'er all we think and all we feel,
      How matchless his control!

4   And, O, how precious is his love
      In tender mercy given;
    It whispers of the blest above,
      And stays the soul on heaven.

5   From mind to mind, in streams of joy,
      The holy influence spreads;
    'T is peace, 'tis praise without alloy,
      For God that influence sheds.

6   To thee, O God, we still will pray,
      And praise thee as before;
    For this thy glorious gospel-day,
      Teach us to praise thee more.

"Help thou my unbelief."


1   If listening, as I listen still,
      O God! to thine instructive word,
    In spite of all my spirit's will,
      Some whispering voice of doubt is heard,--
    That voice spontaneous from the soul,
    Which nought can check and nought control;

2   If when most earnestly I pray
      For light, for aid, for strength from thee,
    Some struggling thoughts will force their way,
      And break my soul's serenity;--
    If reason, thy best gift, will hold
    The sceptre only half controlled:--

3   Help and forgive! heaven's alphabet
      Hath many a word of mystery;
    I read not all thy record yet,
      Though perseveringly I try;
    But teach me, Lord! and none shall be
    More prompt, more pleased to learn of thee.

Doing all to the Glory of God.


1     Teach me, my God and King,
      In all things thee to see;
    And what I do in anything,
      To do it as for thee!

2     To scorn the senses' sway,
      While still to thee I tend;
    In all I do be thou the way,--
      In all be thou the end.

3     All may of thee partake:
      Nothing so small can be,
    But draws, when acted for thy sake,
      Greatness and worth from thee.

4     If done beneath thy laws,
      Even servile labors shine;
    Hallowed is toil, if this the cause,
      The meanest work divine.

God the Pilgrim's Guide and Strength.


1   Guide me, O thou great Jehovah,
      Pilgrim through this mortal land:
    I am weak, but thou art mighty;
      Hold me with thy powerful hand:
          Bread of heaven,
      Feed me till I want no more.

2   Open now the crystal fountain,
      Whence the healing streams do flow;

      I will ever give to thee.

Prayer for Faith.


1   Lord! I believe; thy power I own,
      Thy word I would obey;
    I wander comfortless, and lone,
      When from thy truth I stray.

2   Lord! I believe; but gloomy fears
      Sometimes bedim my sight;
    I look to thee with prayers and tears,
      And cry for strength and light.

3   Lord! I believe; but oft, I know,
      My faith is cold and weak;
    Strengthen my weakness, and bestow
      The confidence I seek!

4   Yes, I believe; and only thou
      Canst give my soul relief;
    Lord! to thy truth my spirit bow,
      Help thou my unbelief!

      To heaven I lift mine eyes.

2   O lead me to the rock
      That's high above my head;
    And make the covert of thy wings
      My shelter and my shade.

3   Within thy presence, Lord,
      I ever would abide;
    Thou art the tower of my defence,
      The refuge where I hide.

1   Father of all our mercies, thou
      In whom we move and live,
    Hear us in heaven, thy dwelling, now,
      And answer, and forgive.

2   When, harassed by ten thousand foes,
      Our helplessness we feel,
    O, give the weary soul repose,
      The wounded spirit heal.

3   When dire temptations gather round
      And threaten or allure,
    By storm or calm, in thee be found
      A refuge strong and sure.

4   When age advances, may we grow
      In faith, in hope, and love,
    And walk in holiness below
      To holiness above.

5   When earthly joys and cares depart,
      Desire and envy cease,
    Be thou the portion of our heart,--
      In thee may we have peace.

The Solace of Faith.


1   When human hopes and joys depart,
    I give thee, Lord, a contrite heart;
    And on my weary spirit steal
    The thoughts that pass all earthly weal.

2   I cast above my tearful eyes,
    And muse upon the starry skies;
    And think that He who governs there
    Still keeps me in his guardian care.

3   I gaze upon the opening flower,
    Just moistened with the evening shower;
    And bless the love which made it bloom,
    To chase away my transient gloom.

4   I think, whene'er this mortal frame
    Returns again to whence it came,
    My soul shall wing its happy flight
    To regions of eternal light.

1   O, for a heart to praise my God,
      A heart from sin set free;
    A heart that always feels how good,
      Thou, Lord, hast been to me.

2   O for a humble, contrite heart,
      Believing, true, and clean,
    Which neither life nor death can part
      From him who dwells within;--

3   A heart in every thought renewed,
      And full of love divine,
    Perfect, and right, and pure and good,
      Conformed, O Lord, to thine.

4   Thy temper, gracious Lord, impart;

      Thy name, O God, is Love.

2   Thy voice we hear, thy presence feel,
      Whilst thou, too pure for mortal sight,
    Involved in clouds, invisible,
      Reignest the Lord of life and light.

3   We know not in what hallowed part
      Of the wide heavens thy throne may be;
    But this we know,--that where thou art,
      Strength, wisdom, goodness, dwell with thee.

4   Thy children shall not faint nor fear,
      Sustained by this delightful thought,--
    Since thou, their God, art everywhere,
      They cannot be where thou art not.

3   Order my footsteps by thy word,
      And make my heart sincere;
    Let sin have no dominion, Lord,
      But keep my conscience clear.

4   Make me to walk in thy commands,--
      'Tis a delightful road;
    Nor let my head, or heart, or hands,
      Offend against my God.

"Lord, remember me."


1   O thou, from whom all goodness flows,
      I lift my soul to thee;
    In all my sorrows, conflicts, woes,
      Good Lord, remember me.

2   When on my aching, burdened heart
      My sins lie heavily,
    Thy pardon grant, new peace impart:
      Good Lord, remember me.

3   When trials sore obstruct my way,
      And ills I cannot flee,
    O let my strength be as my day:
      Good Lord, remember me.

4   And when before thy throne I stand,
      And lift my soul to thee,
    Then, with the saints at thy right hand,
      Good Lord, remember me!

Prayer for Divine Guidance.


1   Teach me, O teach me, Lord! thy way;
    So, to my life's remotest day,
    By thy unerring precepts led,
    My willing feet its paths shall tread.

2   Informed by thee, with sacred awe,
    My heart shall meditate thy law;
    And with celestial wisdom filled,
    To thee its full obedience yield.

3   Give me to know thy will aright,--
    Thy will, my glory and delight.--
    That, raised above the world, my mind
    In thee its highest good may find.

4   O turn from vanity mine eye;
    To me thy quickening strength supply;
    And with thy promised mercy cheer
    A heart devoted to thy fear.

The Repose of Faith.


1   Happy soul, that safe from harm
    Rests within his Shepherd's arm!
    Who his quiet shall molest?
    Who shall violate his rest?

2   Seek, O Lord, thy wandering sheep;
    Bring me back, and lead, and keep;
    Take on thee my every care;
    Bear me, on thy bosom bear.

3   Let me know thy gracious voice;
    More and more in thee rejoice;
    More and more of thee receive;
    Ever in thy spirit live:--

4   Live, till all thy love I know,
    Perfect in my Lord below;
    Gladly then from earth remove,
    Gathered to the fold above.

A Rest Remaineth.


1   Lord! we believe a rest remains
      To all thy people known;
    A rest where pure enjoyment reigns;--
      For thou art served alone:--

2   A rest where all our souls desire
      Is fixed on things above;
    Where fear, and sin, and grief expire,
      Cast out by perfect love.

3   O that we now that rest might know,
      Believe and enter in!
    Thou Holiest! now the power bestow,
      And let us cease from sin.

4   Remove this hardness from our heart,
      This unbelief remove:
    The rest of perfect faith impart,
      The sabbath of thy love.

Angels from Heaven Strengthening Him.


1   Lord! in thy garden agony,
      No light seemed on thy soul to break,
    No form of seraph lingered nigh,
      Nor yet the voice of comfort spake;

2   Till, by thine own triumphant word,
      The victory over, ill was won;
    Till the sweet, mournful cry was heard,
      "Thy will, O God, not mine, be done!"

3   Lord, bring these precious moments back,
      When, fainting, against sin we strain;
    Or in thy counsels fail to track
      Aught but the present grief and pain.

4   In weakness, help us to contend;
      In darkness, yield to God our will;
    And true hearts, faithful to the end,
      Cheer by thine holy angels still!

Filial Submission.


1   And can my heart aspire so high,
      To say, "My Father," God?
    Lord, at thy feet, I fain would lie,
      And learn to kiss the rod.

2   I would submit to all thy will,
      For thou art good and wise;
    Let each rebellious thought be still,
      Nor one faint murmur rise.

3   Thy love can cheer the darkest gloom,
      And bid me wait serene,
    Till hopes and joys immortal bloom,
      And brighten all the scene.

4   "My Father, God," permit my heart
      To plead her humble claim,
    And ask the bliss those words impart,
      In my Redeemer's name.

Universal Prayer.


1   Father of all! in every age,
      In every clime, adored,
    By saint, by savage, and by sage,
      Jehovah, Jove, or Lord!--

2   Save me alike from foolish pride,
      Or impious discontent
    At aught thy wisdom has denied,
      Or aught thy goodness lent.

3   This day be bread and peace my lot:
      All else beneath the sun
    Thou knowest if best bestowed or not
      And let thy will be done.

4   Yet not to earth's contracted span
      Thy goodness let me bound,
    Or think thee Lord alone of man,
      When thousand worlds are round.

5   To thee whose temple is all space,
      Whose altar, earth, sea, skies,
    One chorus let all beings raise,
      All nature's incense rise.

The Same.


1   Father of all, whose cares extend
      To earth's remotest shore,
    Through every age let praise ascend,
      And every clime adore.

2   Mean though I am, not wholly so,
      Since quickened by thy breath;
    Lord, lead me wheresoe'er I go,
      Through this day's life or death.

3   Teach me to feel another's woe,
      To hide the fault I see;
    That mercy I to others show,
      That mercy show to me.

4   If I am right, thy grace impart
      Still in the right to stay;
    If I am wrong, O teach my heart
      To find that better way.

5   What conscience dictates to be done,
      Or warns me not to do,
    This teach me more than hell to shun,
      That more than heaven pursue.
