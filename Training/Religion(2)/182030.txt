hypothesis that the Hebrew patriarchs were subjects of Babylon in
Palestine is not required as an explanation of the facts; and our first
period still stands or falls by the question of the Mosaic authorship of
the Pentateuch, which must be decided on quite other grounds. Those who
do not accept the traditional view will probably be content to rule this
first period out.

     (1) See Cook, _The Laws of Moses and the Code of Hammurabi_,
     p. 281 f.; Driver, _Genesis_, p. xxxvi f.; and cf. Johns,
     _The Laws of Babylonia and the Laws of the Hebrew Peoples_
     (Schweich Lectures, 1912), pp. 50 ff.

During the second period, that of the settlement in Canaan, the Hebrews
came into contact with a people who had used the Babylonian language as
the common medium of communication throughout the Near East. It is an
interesting fact that among the numerous letters found at Tell el-Amarna
were two texts of quite a different character. These were legends, both
in the form of school exercises, which had been written out for practice
in the Babylonian tongue. One of them was the legend of Adapa, in which
we noted just now a distant resemblance to the Hebrew story of Paradise.
It seems to me we are here standing on rather firmer ground; and
provisionally we might place the beginning of our process after the time
of Hebrew contact with the Canaanites.

Under the earlier Hebrew monarchy there was no fresh influx of
Babylonian culture into Palestine. That does not occur till our last
main period, the later Judaean monarchy, when, in consequence of the
westward advance of Assyria, the civilization of Babylon was once more
carried among the petty Syrian states. Israel was first drawn into the
circle of Assyrian influence, when Arab fought as the ally of Benhadad
of Damascus at the battle of Karkar in 854 B.C.; and from that date
onward the nation was menaced by the invading power. In 734 B.C., at the
invitation of Ahaz of Judah, Tiglath-Pileser IV definitely intervened
in the affairs of Israel. For Ahaz purchased his help against the allied
armies of Israel and Syria in the Syro-Ephraimitish war. Tiglath-pileser
threw his forces against Damascus and Israel, and Ahaz became his
vassal.(1) To this period, when Ahaz, like Panammu II, "ran at the
wheel of his lord, the king of Assyria", we may ascribe the first marked
invasion of Assyrian influence over Judah. Traces of it may be seen in
the altar which Ahaz caused to be erected in Jerusalem after the pattern
of the Assyrian altar at Damascus.(2) We saw in the first lecture, in
the monuments we have recovered of Panammu I and of Bar-rekub, how the
life of another small Syrian state was inevitably changed and thrown
into new channels by the presence of Tiglath-pileser and his armies in
the West.

     (2) 2 Kings xvi. 10 ff.

Hezekiah's resistance checked the action of Assyrian influence on Judah
for a time. But it was intensified under his son Manasseh, when Judah
again became tributary to Assyria, and in the house of the Lord altars
were built to all the host of heaven.(1) Towards the close of his long
reign Manasseh himself was summoned by Ashur-bani-pal to Babylon.(2) So
when in the year 586 B.C. the Jewish exiles came to Babylon they could
not have found in its mythology an entirely new and unfamiliar subject.
They must have recognized several of its stories as akin to those they
had assimilated and now regarded as their own. And this would naturally
have inclined them to further study and comparison.

     (2) Cf. 2 Chron. xxxiii. 11 ff.

The answer I have outlined to this problem is the one that appears to
me most probable, but I do not suggest that it is the only possible
one that can be given. What I do suggest is that the Hebrews must have
gained some acquaintance with the legends of Babylon in pre-exilic
times. And it depends on our reading of the evidence into which of the
three main periods the beginning of the process may be traced.

So much, then, for the influence of Babylon. We have seen that no
similar problem arises with regard to the legends of Egypt. At first
sight this may seem strange, for Egypt lay nearer than Babylon to
Palestine, and political and commercial intercourse was at least as
close. We have already noted how Egypt influenced Semitic art, and how
she offered an ideal, on the material side of her existence, which
was readily adopted by her smaller neighbours. Moreover, the Joseph
traditions in Genesis give a remarkably accurate picture of ancient
Egyptian life; and even the Egyptian proper names embedded in that
narrative may be paralleled with native Egyptian names than that to
which the traditions refer. Why then is it that the actual myths and
legends of Egypt concerning the origin of the world and its civilization
should have failed to impress the Hebrew mind, which, on the other hand,
was so responsive to those of Babylon?

One obvious answer would be, that it was Nebuchadnezzar II, and not
Necho, who carried the Jews captive. And we may readily admit that the
Captivity must have tended to perpetuate and intensify the effects of
any Babylonian influence that may have previously been felt. But I think
there is a wider and in that sense a better answer than that.

I do not propose to embark at this late hour on what ethnologists know
as the "Hamitic" problem. But it is a fact that many striking parallels
to Egyptian religious belief and practice have been traced among races
of the Sudan and East Africa. These are perhaps in part to be explained
as the result of contact and cultural inheritance. But at the same time
they are evidence of an African, but non-Negroid, substratum in the
religion of ancient Egypt. In spite of his proto-Semitic strain, the
ancient Egyptian himself never became a Semite. The Nile Valley, at
any rate until the Moslem conquest, was stronger than its invaders; it
received and moulded them to its own ideal. This quality was shared in
some degree by the Euphrates Valley. But Babylonia was not endowed with
Egypt's isolation; she was always open on the south and west to the
Arabian nomad, who at a far earlier period sealed her Semitic type.

To such racial division and affinity I think we may confidently trace
the influence exerted by Egypt and Babylon respectively upon Hebrew
tradition.

It may be of assistance to the reader to repeat in tabular form the
equivalents to the mythical kings of Berossus which are briefly
discussed in Lecture I. In the following table the two new equations,
obtained from the earliest section of the Sumerian Dynastic List, are in
upper-case.(1) The established equations to other names are in normal
case, while those for which we should possibly seek other equivalents
are enclosed within brackets.(2) Aruru has not been included as a
possible equivalent for {'Aloros}.(3)

      1. {'Aloros}
      2. {'Alaparos (? 'Adaparos)}, _Alaporus_, _Alapaurus_      (Adapa)

     (4) The hundred and twenty "sars", or 432,000 years assigned
     by Berossus for the duration of the Antediluvian dynasty,
     are distributed as follows among the ten kings; the numbers
     are given below first in "sars", followed by their
     equivalents in years within brackets: 1. Ten "sars"
     (36,000); 2. Three (10,800); 3. Thirteen (46,800); 4. Twelve
     (43,200); 5. Eighteen (64,800); 6. Ten (36,000); 7. Eighteen

For comparison with Berossus it may be useful to abstract from the
Sumerian Dynastic List the royal names occurring in the earliest
extant dynasties. They are given below with variant forms from
duplicate copies of the list, and against each is added the number of
years its owner is recorded to have ruled. The figures giving the
total duration of each dynasty, either in the summaries or under the
separate reigns, are sometimes not completely preserved; in such cases
an x is added to the total of the figures still legible. Except in
those cases referred to in the foot-notes, all the names are written
in the Sumerian lists without the determinative for "god".

     (1) Gap of seven, or possibly eight, names.

     (2) The name Etana is written in the lists with and without
     the determinative for "god".

     (3) The reading of the last sign in the name is unknown. A
     variant form of the name possibly begins with Bali.

     (4) This form is given on a fragment of a late Assyrian copy
     of the list; cf. _Studies in Eastern History_, Vol. III, p.
     143.

     (5) Gap of four, or possibly three, names.

     (6) Eanna was the great temple of Erech. In the Second
     Column of the list "the kingdom" is recorded to have passed
     from Kish to Eanna, but the latter name does not occur in
     the summary.

     (7) The name Lugalbanda is written in the lists with and
     without the determinative for "god".

     (8) The name Dumuzi is written in the list with the
     determinative for "god".

     (9) The name Gishbilgames is written in the list with the
     determinative for "god".

     (10) Gap of about four, five, or six kings.

     (11) Wanting.

At this point a great gap occurs in our principal list. The names of
some of the missing "kingdoms" may be inferred from the summaries, but
their relative order is uncertain. Of two of them we know the duration,
a second Kingdom of Ur containing four kings and lasting for a hundred
and eight years, and another kingdom, the name of which is not
preserved, consisting of only one king who ruled for seven years. The
dynastic succession only again becomes assured with the opening of the
Dynastic chronicle published by Pere Scheil and recently acquired by the
British Museum. It will be noted that with the Kingdom of Ur the
separate reigns last for decades and not hundreds of years each, so that
we here seem to approach genuine tradition, though the Kingdom of Awan
makes a partial reversion to myth so far as its duration is concerned.
