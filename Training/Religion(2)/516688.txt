    Not Solomon in all his pride
      With them would bear comparing.

    The dove from out her nest doth fly;
    Far upward in the clear blue sky
      The lark her way is winging;
    Hark to the lovely nightingale!
    With her sweet song each hill and dale,
      And woods and rocks, are ringing.

    The hen brings out her little brood,
    The swallow finds her young ones food,
      The stork her house is keeping.
    The bounding stag, the timid roe,
    Are full of joy, and to and fro,
      Through the high grass, are leaping.

    The brook is tinkling as it goes,
    And with the myrtle and the rose
      Its shady banks adorning;
    While, from the flowery mead near by,
    The sheep and shepherd's joyful cry
      Salutes the early morning.

    The never idle troops of bees
    Fly here and there, and where they please
      Their honey food are quaffing;
    The sap is running up the vine,
    Round the old elm its tendrils twine,
      And in the sun are laughing.

    And can I, may I, silent be?
    When all God's glorious works I see
      My soul desires to know him.
    When all are singing I must sing,
    And to the Highest I must bring
      The tribute which I owe him.

    Are all things here so bright and fair,
    And has he with a loving care
      My happy being given?
    What, in the glorious world above,
    Where all is beauty, all is love,--
      What shall I be in heaven?

    O, were I there! O, stood I now
    In that great Presence! there to bow
      In grateful love before him,
    Then would I with the angels raise
    One never-ending song of praise,
      And worship and adore him!


TO A BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

    Sweet flower! so young, so fresh, so fair,
    Bright pleasure sparkling in thine eye,
    Alas! e'en thee time will not spare,
                     And thou must die.

    The heart with youthful hope so gay,
    That scarcely ever breathed a sigh,
    Must weep o'er pleasures fled away,
                     For all must die.

    But though the rosy cheek may fade,
    The virtuous wish, the purpose high,
    The bloom with which the soul's arrayed,
                     Shall never die.


THE LITTLE SLAVE'S WISH.

    I wish I was that little bird
      Up in the bright blue sky,
    That sings and flies just where he will,
      And no one asks him why.

    I wish I was that little brook
      That runs so swift along,
    Through pretty flowers, and shining stones,
      Singing a merry song.

    I wish I was a butterfly,
      Without a fear or care,
    Spreading my many-colored wings,
      Like a flower in the air.

    I wish I was that wild, wild deer,
      That I saw the other day,
    Who through the dark green forest flew,
      Like an arrow far away.

    I wish I was that little cloud
      By the gentle south-wind driven,
    Floating along so calm and bright
      Up to the gates of heaven.

    I'd rather be a savage beast,
      And dwell in a gloomy cave,
    And shake the forest when I roared,
      Than what I am,--a slave.

    My mother calls me her good boy,
      My father calls me brave;
    What wicked action have I done
      That I should be a slave?

    They tell me God is very good.
      That his right arm can save;
    O, is it, can it, be his will
      That I should be a slave?

    O, how much better 'tis to die,
      And lie down in the grave,
    Than 'tis to be what I am now,--
      A little negro slave!

FABLES.


THE HONEST BIRD.

    Once on a time, a little bird
    Within a wicker cage was heard,
    In mournful tones, these words to sing:--
    "In vain I stretch my useless wing;
    Still round and round I vainly fly,
    And strive in vain for liberty.
    Dear liberty, how sweet thou art!"
    The prisoner sings, with breaking heart:--
    "All other things I'd give for thee,
    Nor ask one joy but liberty."

    He sang so sweet, a little mouse,
    Who often ran about the house,
    Came to his cage; her cunning ear
    She turned, the mournful bird to hear.
    Soon as he ceased,--"Suppose," said she,
    "I could contrive to set you free;
    Would you those pretty wings give me?"

    The cage was in the window-seat,
    The sky was blue, the air was sweet.
    The bird with eagerness replied,--
    "O, yes! my wings, and see, beside,
    These seeds and apples, sugar, too,
    All, pretty mouse, I'll give to you,
    If you will only set me free;
    For, O, I pant for liberty!"

    The mouse soon gnawed a hole; the bird,
    In ecstasy, forgot his word;
    Swift as an arrow, see, he flies,
    Far up, far up, towards the skies;
    But see, he stops, now he descends,
    Towards the cage his course he bends.
    "Kind mouse," said he, "behold me now
    Returned to keep my foolish vow;
    I only longed for freedom then,
    Nor thought to want my wings again.
    Better with life itself to part,
    Than, living, have a faithless heart;
    Do with me, therefore, as you will,
    An honest bird I will be still."

    His heart seemed full, no more he said,
    He drooped his wings and hung his head.
    The mouse, though very pert and smart,
    Had yet a very tender heart;
    She minced a little, twirled about,
    Then thus her sentiments threw out:--
    "I don't care much about your wings,--
    Apples and cakes are better things;
    You love the clouds, I choose the house;
    Wings would look queer upon a mouse.
    My nice long tail is better far,
    So keep your wings just where they are."

    She munched some apple, gave a smack,
    And ran into her little crack.
    The bird spread out his wings and flew,
    And vanished in the sky's deep blue;
    Far up his joyful song he poured,
    And sang of freedom as he soared.


SOLILOQUY

OF ELLEN'S SQUIRREL, ON RECEIVING HIS LIBERTY;--OVERHEARD BY A LOVER
OF NATURE AND A FRIEND OF ELLEN.

    Was that the music of the wind,
      That whispered in my trembling ear?
    And can I, free and unconfined,
      Taste of the joys that still are dear?

    And can I skip from tree to tree,
      And fly along the flowery plain,
    Light as the wind, as fleet, as free,
      And make my winter's nest again?

    O, yes! my joyful, trembling heart,
      The song you heard from yonder tree,
    Which made awakening memory start,
      Was the sweet sound of Liberty!

    Dear Ellen, many thanks I owe
      For tenderest care bestowed on me;
    But most my gratitude will flow
      For your best gift,--sweet Liberty!

    Oft in your gayest, happiest hour,
      When all your youthful heart beats high,
    And, hastening on from flower to flower,
      You taste the sweets of Liberty,

    The thought that you have set me free,
      That I can skip and dance like you,
    To your kind, tender heart shall be
      As pure a joy as e'er you knew.

    Scarce can my wakening sense believe
      The sounds I hear, the sights I see;
    Dear Ellen, once again receive
      Your Squirrel's thanks for Liberty.


THE PIN, NEEDLE, AND SCISSORS.

    'Tis true, although 'tis sad to say,
    Disputes are rising every day.
    You'd think, if no one did deny it,
    A little work-box might be quiet;
    But 'tis not so, for I did hear,
    Or else I dreamed it, 'tis so queer,
    A Pin and Needle in the cushion
    Maintain the following discussion.

    The Needle, "extra fine gold-eyed,"
    Was very sharp and full of pride,
    And thus, methought, she did begin:--
    You clumsy, thick, short, ugly Pin,
    I wish you were not quite so near;
    How could my mistress stick me here?
    She should have put me in my place,
    With my bright sisters in the case."

    "Would you were there!" the Pin replied;
    "I do not want you by my side.
    I'm rather short and thick, 'tis true;
    Who'd be so long and thin as you?
    I've got a head, though, of my own,
    That you had better let alone."

    "You make me laugh," the Needle cried;
    "That you've a head can't be denied;
    For _you_ a very proper head,
    Without an eye, and full of lead."

    "You are so cross, and sharp, and thin,"
    Replied the poor insulted Pin,
    "I hardly dare a word to say,
    And wish indeed you were away;
    That golden eye in your poor head
    Was only made to hold a thread;
    All your fine airs are foolish fudge,
    For you are nothing but a drudge;
    But I, in spite of your abuse,
    Am made for pleasure and for use.
    I fasten the bouquet and sash,
    And help the ladies make a dash;
    I go abroad and gayly roam,
    While you are rusting here at home."

    "Stop," cried the Needle, "you're too much,
    You've brass enough to beat the Dutch;
    Do I not make the ladies' clothes,
    Ere I retire to my repose?
    Then who, forsooth, the glory wins?
    Alas! 'tis finery and pins.
    This is the world's unjust decree,
    But what is this vain world to me?
    I'd rather live with my own kin,
    Than dance about like you, vain Pin.
    I'm taken care of every day;
    You're used awhile, then thrown away,
    Or else you get all bent up double,
    And a snug crack for all your trouble."

    "True," said the Pin, "I am abused,
    And sometimes very roughly used;
    I often get an ugly crook,
    Or fall into a dirty nook;
    But there I lie, and never mind it;
    Who wants a pin is sure to find it;
    In time I am picked up, and then
    I lead a merry life again.
    You fuss so at a fall or hurt,
    And, if you get a little dirt,
    You keep up such an odious creaking,
    That where you are there is no speaking;
    And then your lackey Emery's called,
    And he, poor thing, is pricked and mauled,
    Until your daintiness--O, shocking!--
    Is fit for what? to mend a stocking!"

    The Needle now began to speak,--
    They might have quarrelled for a week,--
    But here the Scissors interposed.
    And thus the warm debate was closed:--
    "You angry Needle! foolish Pin!
    How did this nonsense first begin?
    You should have both been better taught;
    But I will cut the matter short.
    You both are wrong, and both are right,
    And both are very impolite.
    E'en in a work-box 'twill not do
    To talk of every thing that's true.
    All personal remarks avoid,
    For every one will be annoyed
    At hearing disagreeable truth;
    Besides, it shows you quite uncouth,
    And sadly wanting in good taste.
    But what advantages you waste!
    Think, Pins and Needles, while you may,
    How much you hear in one short day;
    No servants wait on lordly man
    Can hear one half of what you can.
    'Tis not worth while to mince the matter;
    Nor men nor boys like girls can chatter;
    All now are learning, forward moving,
    E'en Pins and Needles are improving;
    And in this glorious, busy day
    All have some useful part to play.
    Go forth, ye Pins, and bring home news!
    Ye Needles in your cases muse!
    And take me for your kind adviser,
    And only think of growing wiser;
    Then, when you meet again, no doubt,
    Something you'll have to talk about,
    And need not get into a passion,
    And quarrel in this vulgar fashion.
    Less of yourselves you'll think, and more
    Of others, than you did before.
    You'll learn, that in their own right sphere
    All things with dignity appear.
    And have, when in their proper place,
    Peculiar use and native grace."

    Methought the polished Scissors blushed
    To have said so much, and all was hushed.


LEARNED FRED.
