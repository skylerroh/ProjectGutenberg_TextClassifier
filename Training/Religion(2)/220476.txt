    And pay my humble worship there,
        Shall be my sweet employ:
    The day that saw my Saviour rise
    Shall dawn on my delighted eyes
        With pure and holy joy.

3   With grateful sorrow in my breast,
    I'll celebrate the dying feast
        Of my exalted Lord;
    And, while his perfect love I view,
    His bright example I'll pursue,
        And meditate his word.

1     How pleased and blest was I
      To hear the people cry,
    "Come, let us seek our God to-day!"
      Yes, with a cheerful zeal,
      We haste to Zion's hill,
    And there our vows and honors pay.

2     Zion, thrice happy place,
      Adorned with wondrous grace,
    And walls of strength embrace thee round;
      In thee our tribes appear,
      To pray, and praise, and hear
    The sacred gospel's joyful sound.

3     May peace attend thy gate,
      And joy within thee wait,
    To bless the soul of every guest;
      The man who seeks thy peace,
      And wishes thine increase,
    A thousand blessings on him rest.

Divine Love.


1   Love divine, all love excelling,
      Joy of heaven, to earth come down!
    Fix in us thy humble dwelling,
      All thy faithful mercies crown.
    Father! thou art all compassion,
      Pure, unbounded love thou art;
    Visit us with thy salvation,
      Enter every longing heart.

2   Breathe, O breathe thy loving spirit
      Into every troubled breast;
    Let us all in thee inherit,
      Let us find thy promised rest.
    Come, almighty to deliver,
      Let us all thy life receive,
    Graciously come down, and never,
      Never more thy temples leave.

1   O Thou, to whom, in ancient time,
      The lyre of Hebrew bards was strung,
    Whom kings adored in song sublime,
      And prophets praised with glowing tongue!

2   Not now on Zion's height alone
      Thy favored worshipper may dwell;
    Nor where, at sultry noon, thy Son,
      Sat weary, by the Patriarch's well.

3   From every place below the skies,
      The grateful song, the fervent prayer--
    The incense of the heart--may rise
      To Heaven, and find acceptance there.

4   To thee shall age, with snowy hair,
      And strength and beauty bend the knee,
    And childhood lisp, with reverent air,
      Its praises and its prayers to thee.

5   O Thou, to whom, in ancient time,
      The lyre of prophet-bards was strung,
    To thee, at last, in every clime
      Shall temples rise, and praise be sung.

2   When we thy mercy-seat surround,
      Thy Spirit, Lord, impart;
    And let thy gospel's joyful sound
      With power reach every heart.

3   Here let the blind their sight obtain;
      Here give the mourners rest;
    Let Jesus here triumphant reign,
      Enthroned in every breast.

4   Here let the voice of sacred joy
      And humble prayer arise,
    Till higher strains our tongues employ
      In realms beyond the skies.

      Above the starry sky.

      With rays of quickening grace:
    'Tis he that spreads the heavens abroad,

    Come, in the house of God appear,

      Within thy temple-door;
    While young and old in many a band
      Shall throng the sacred floor.

3     Within these walls be peace
      And harmony be found:
    Zion, in all thy palaces,
      Prosperity abound!

    Oft as they meet for worship here,

      Ye who are happy now;
    In sweet accord your voices raise,
      In kindred homage bow.

3     Ye aged, hither come,
      For ye have felt his love:
    Soon shall your trembling tongues be dumb,
      Your lips forget to move.

4     Ye young, before his throne,
      Come, bow; your voices raise;
    Let not your hearts his praise disown
      Who gives the power to praise.

      In mercy looks on all--
    Who see'st the tear of misery,
      And hear'st the mourner's call--

      Bear our frail spirits on,
    Till they outstrip time's tardy pace,
      And heaven on earth be won.

    Shall thither bring our willing feet!

    Weary and weak, thy grace we pray;
    Turn not, O Lord, thy guests away.

2   Long have we roamed in want and pain;
    Long have we sought thy rest in vain;
    Wildered in doubt, in darkness lost,
    Long have our souls been tempest-tost:
    Low at thy feet our sins we lay;
    Turn not, O Lord, thy guests away.

2   'Tis the house of my God, 'tis the dwelling of prayer,
      The temple all hallowed by blessing and praise;
    If sorrow and faithlessness conquer me, there
      My heart to the throne of his grace I can raise.

3   For a refuge like this, ah, what praises are due!
      For a rest so serene, for a covert so fair:
    Ah, why are the seasons of worship so few?
      And why are so seldom the meetings of prayer?

    Nobler thoughts our souls engross,

      Whom words nor thoughts can reach;
    A broken heart shall please him more

      From all pollution free;
    The pure in heart are thy delight,

    And still we seek thy mercy there,
      And sing thy praises still.

    To thee shall all mankind repair,
      And at thy gracious throne appear.

3   Our sins, though numberless, in vain
      To stop thy flowing mercy try;
    For thou wilt cleanse the guilty stain,
      And wash away the crimson dye.

      Within thy sacred dwelling lives;
    Whilst we at humbler distance taste

      Our spirits' light, thy Spirit's grace.

3   That love its holy influence pour,
      To keep us meek, and make us free,
    And throw its binding blessing more
      Round each with all, and all with thee.

4   Send down its angel to our side--
      Send in its calm upon the breast;
    For we would know no other guide,
      And we can need no other rest.

      Yet choose not, Lord, this house alone;
    Thy kingdom come to every heart,

    Day, of all the week the best--

2   Mercies multiplied each hour
      Through the week our praise demand:
    Guarded by almighty power,
      Fed and guided by thy hand,
    May we not forgetful be,
    Nor ungrateful, Lord, to thee.

3   While we seek supplies of grace
      Through the dear Redeemer's name,
    Show thy reconciling face,
      Take away our sin and shame.
    From our worldly cares set free,
    May we rest this day in thee.

4   May the gospel's joyful sound

2   We would adore thee, God sublime!
      Whose power and wisdom, love and grace,
    Are greater than the round of time,
      And wider than the bounds of space,
    O how shall thought expression find,
      All lost in thine immensity!
    How shall we seek thee, glorious Mind,
      Amid thy dread infinity!

3   But thou art present with us here,
      As in thy glittering, high domain;
    And grateful hearts and humble fear
      Can never seek thy face in vain.
    Help us to praise thee, Lord of light!
      Help us thy boundless love declare;
    And, here within thy courts to-night,
      Aid us, and hearken to our prayer.

    No fear nor doubt shall enter here,--
      All shall be thine to-day.

2   We will not bring divided hearts
      To worship at thy shrine;
    But each unworthy thought departs,
      And leaves this temple thine.

3   Then sleep to-day, tormenting cares,
      Of earth and folly born;
    Ye shall not dim the light that streams
      From this celestial morn.

4   To-morrow will be time enough
      To feel your harsh control;
    Ye shall not violate this day,

    While we know, benignant King,
    That the praises which we bring
    Are a worthless offering
      Till thy blessing makes it more.

2   More of truth, and more of might,
    More of love, and more of light,
    More of reason, and of right,
      From thy pardoning grace be given!
    It can make the humblest song
    Sweet, acceptable, and strong,
    As the strains the angels' throng
      Pour around the throne of heaven.

    Rise fervent to thy throne above.

3   Grant that our earthly Sabbaths be
    But dawnings of eternity,
    To shadow forth the glorious rest,
    The heavenly quiet of the blest.

      O, let us, then, his praise declare,
    Fix our desires on him alone,
      And seek his face with fervent prayer.

2   Lord, in thy love we would rejoice,
      Which bids the burdened soul be free,
    And, with united heart and voice,
      Devote these sacred hours to thee.

3   Now let the world's delusive things
      No more our grovelling thoughts employ
    But Faith be taught to stretch her wings,
      In search of heaven's unfailing joy.

4   O, let these earthly Sabbaths, Lord,
      Be to our lasting welfare blest;
    The purest comfort here afford,
      And fit us for eternal rest.

Sabbath Worship.


1     Hail to the Sabbath day!
      The day divinely given,
    When men to God their homage pay,
      And earth draws near to heaven.

2     Lord, in this sacred hour,
      Within thy courts we bend,
    And bless thy love, and own thy power,
      Our Father and our Friend.

3     But thou art not alone
      In courts by mortals trod;
    Nor only is the day thine own
      When man draws near to God.

4     Thy temple is the arch
      Of yon unmeasured sky;
    Thy Sabbath, the stupendous march
      Of grand eternity.

5     Lord, may that holier day
      Dawn on thy servants' sight;
    And purer worship may we pay
      In heaven's unclouded light.

The Delights of the Sabbath.


1     Sweet is the task, O Lord,
      Thy glorious acts to sing,
    To praise thy name, and hear thy word,
      And grateful offerings bring.

2     Sweet, at the dawning hour,
      Thy boundless love to tell;
    And when the night-wind shuts the flower,
      Still on the theme to dwell.

3     Sweet, on this day of rest,
      To join in heart and voice,
    With those who love and serve thee best,
      And in thy name rejoice.

4     To songs of praise and joy,
      Be every Sabbath given,
    That such may be our blest employ
      Eternally in heaven.

The Hour of Prayer.


1   Blest hour, when mortal man retires
      To hold communion with his God,
    To send to heaven his warm desires,
      And listen to the sacred word.

2   Blest hour, when earthly cares resign
      Their empire o'er his anxious breast,
    While, all around, the calm divine
      Proclaims the holy day of rest.

3   Blest hour, when God himself draws nigh,
      Well pleased his people's voice to hear,
    To hush the penitential sigh,
      And wipe away the mourner's tear.

4   Blest hour! for, where the Lord resorts,
      Foretastes of future bliss are given,
    And mortals find his earthly courts
      The house of God, the gate of heaven.

Devout Worship of God.


1   Praise waits in Zion, Lord, for thee;
      Thy saints adore thy holy name;
    Thy creatures bend th' obedient knee,
      And, humbly, thy protection claim.

2   Thy hand has raised us from the dust;
      The breath of life thy Spirit gave;
    Where, but in thee, can mortals trust?
      Who, but our God, has power to save?

3   Still may thy children in thy word
      Their common trust and refuge see;
    O bind us to each other, Lord,
      By one great tie,--the love of thee.

4   So shall our sun of hope arise,
      With brighter still and brighter ray,
    Till thou shalt bless our longing eyes
      With beams of everlasting day.

The Sabbath Welcomed.


1     Welcome, sweet day of rest,
      That saw the Lord arise;
    Welcome to this reviving breast
      And these rejoicing eyes.

2     The King himself comes near,
      And feasts his saints to-day;
    Here we may sit, and see him here,
      And love, and praise, and pray.

3     One day, amid the place
      Where my dear Lord hath been,
    Is sweeter than ten thousand days
      Of folly and of sin.

4     My willing soul would stay
      In such a frame as this,
    Till called to rise and soar away
      To everlasting bliss.

Public Worship.  Ps. 95.


1     Come, sound his praise abroad,
      And hymns of glory sing:
    Jehovah is the sovereign God,
      The universal King.

2     He formed the deeps unknown;
      He gave the seas their bound;
    The watery worlds are all his own,
      And all the solid ground.

3     Come, worship at his throne;
      Come, bow before the Lord;
    We are his works, and not our own:
      He formed us by his word.

4     To-day attend his voice,
      Nor dare provoke his rod;
    Come, like the people of his choice,
      And own your gracious God.

Homage and Devotion.


1   With sacred joy we lift our eyes
      To those bright realms above--
    That glorious temple in the skies
      Where dwells eternal love.

2   Thee we adore, and, Lord, to thee
      Our filial duty pay;
    Thy service, unconstrained and free,
      Conducts to endless day.

3   While in thy house of prayer we kneel
      With trust and holy fear,
    Thy mercy and thy truth reveal,
      And lend a gracious ear.

4   With fervor teach our hearts to pray,
      And tune our lips to sing;
    Nor from thy presence cast away
      The sacrifice we bring.

The Lord's Day.


1   How welcome to the soul, when pressed
      With six days' noise, and care, and toil,
    Is the returning day of rest,
      Which hides us from the world awhile!

2   How happy they, whose lot is cast
      Where Christ invites the "weary" yet;
    They find their sorrows quickly past,
      And all their burdens soon forget.

3   Though pinched with poverty at home,
      With sharp afflictions daily fed,
    It makes amends, if they can come
      To God's own house for heavenly bread.

4   We thank thee for thy day, O Lord!
      And here thy promised presence seek;
    Open thy hand with blessings stored,
      And give us manna for the week.

1   Father of all! where shall we find
      A temple suited to thy praise?
    To thee, the uncreated Mind,
      What earthly altar shall we raise?

2   We'll call a multitude around,
      And gladly seek the house of prayer;
    There thy salvation we have found,
