                A burst of smoke from the pit lifts to the skies;
                Hawaii's beneath, birth-land of Keawe;
                Malama's beach looms before Lohian,
                Where landed the chief from Kahiki,
            5   From a voyage on the blue sea, the dark sea,
                The foam-mottled sea of Kane,
                What time curled waves of the king-whelming flood.
                The sea up-swells, invading the land--

                Lo Kane, outstretched at his ease!
           10   Smoke and flame o'ershadow the uplands,
                Conflagration by Laka, the woman
                Hopoe wreathed with flowers of lehua,
                Stringing the pandanus fruit.
                Screw-palms that clash in Pan'-ewa--
           15   Pan'-ewa, whose groves of lehua
                Are nourished by lava shag,
                Lehua that bourgeons with flame.

                Night, it is night
                O'er Puna and Hilo!
           20   Night from the smoke of my land!
                For the people salvation!
                But the land is on fire!

           The Hawaiian who furnished the meles which, in their
           translated forms, are designated as canto I, canto II, and so
           on, spoke of them as _pale_, and, following his
           nomenclature, the term has been retained, though more
           intimate acquaintance with the meles and with the term has
           shown that the nearest English synonym to correspond with
           pale would be the word division. Still, perhaps with a
           mistaken tenderness for the word, the author has retained the
           caption Canto, as a sort of nodding recognition of the old
           Hawaiian's term--division of a poem. No idea is entertained
           that the five _pale_ above given were composed by the same
           bard, or that they represent productions from the same
           individual standpoint. They do, however, breathe a spirit
           much in common; so that when the old Hawaiian insisted that
           they are so far related to one another as to form a natural
           series for recitation in the hula, being species of the same
           genus, as it were, he was not far from the truth. The man's
           idea seemed to be that they were so closely related that,
           like beads of harmonious colors and shapes, they might be
           strung on the same thread without producing a dissonance.

           Of these five poems, or _pale_ (pah-lay), numbers I, II, and
           IV were uttered in a natural tone of voice, termed _kawele_,
           otherwise termed _ko'i-honua_. The purpose of this style of
           recitation was to adapt the tone to the necessities of the
[Page 90]  aged when their ears no longer heard distinctly. It would
           require an audiphone to illustrate perfectly the difference
           between this method of pronunciation and the _ai-ha'a_, which
           was employed in the recitation of cantos III and V. The
           _ai-ha'a_ was given in a strained and guttural tone.

           The poetical reciter and cantillator, whether in the halau or
           in the king's court, was wont to heighten the oratorical
           effect of his recitation by certain crude devices, the most
           marked of which was that of choking the voice down, as it
           were, into the throat, and there letting it strain and growl
           like a hungry lion. This was the ai-ha'a, whose organic
           function was the expression of the underground passions of
           the soul.

                              XI.--THE HULA KI'I


           I was not a little surprised when I learned that the ancient
           hula repertory of the Hawaiians included a performance with
           marionettes, _ki'i_, dressed up to represent human beings.
           But before accepting the hula _ki'i_ as a product indigenous
           to Hawaii, I asked myself: Might not this be a performance in
           imitation of the Punch-and-Judy show familiar to Europe and
           America?

           After careful study of the question no evidence was found,
           other than what might be inferred from general resemblance,
           for the theory of adoption from a European or American
           origin. On the contrary, the words used as an accompaniment
           to the play agree with report and tradition, and bear
           convincing evidence in form, and matter to a Hawaiian
           antiquity. That is not to say, however, that in the use of
           marionettes the Hawaiians did not hark back to their
           ancestral homes in the southern sea or to a remoter past in
           Asia.

           The six marionettes, _ki'i_ (pls. VIII and IX), in the
           writer's possession were obtained from a distinguished
           kumu-hula, who received them by inheritance, as it were, from
           his brother. "He gave them to me," said he, "with these
           words,' Take care of these things, and when the time comes,
           after my death, that the king wants you to perform before
           him, be ready to fulfill his desire.'"

           It was in the reign of Kamehameha III that they came into the
           hands of the elder brother, who was then and continued to be
           the royal hula-master until his death. These ki'i have
           therefore figured in performances that have been graced by
           the presence of King Kauikeaouli (Kamehameha III) and his
           queen, Kalama, and by his successors since then down to the
           times of Kalakaua. At the so-called "jubilee," the
           anniversary of Kalakaua's fiftieth birthday, these
           marionettes were very much in evidence.

           The make-up and style of these ki'i are so similar that a
           description of one will serve for all six. This marionette
           represents the figure of a man, and was named _Maka-ku_ (pl.
           IX). The head is carved out of some soft wood--either kukui
           or wiliwili---which is covered, as to the hairy scalp, with a
           dark woven fabric much like broadcloth. It is encircled at
           the level of the forehead with a broad band of gilt braid, as
           if to ape the style of a soldier. The median line from the
           forehead over the vertex to the back-head is crested with the
           _mahiole_ ridge. This, taken in connection with the
[Page 92]  encircling gilt band, gives to the head a warlike appearance,
           somewhat as if it were armed with the classical helmet, the
           Hawaiian name for which is _mahi-ole_. The crest of the ridge
           and its points of junction with the forehead and back-head
           are decorated with fillets of wool dyed of a reddish color,
           in apparent imitation of the _mamo_ or _o-o_, the birds whose
           feathers were used in decorating helmets, cloaks, and other
           regalia. The features are carved with some attempt at
           fidelity. The eyes are set with mother-of-pearl.

           The figure is of about one-third life size, and was
           originally draped, the author was told, in a loose robe,
           _holoku_ of tapa cloth of the sort known as _mahuna_, which
           is quite thin. This piece of tapa is perforated at short
           intervals with small holes, _kiko'i_. It is also stained with
           the juice from the bark of the root of the kukui tree, which
           imparts a color like that of copper, and makes the Hawaiians
           class it as _pa'ikukui_. A portion of its former, its
           original, apparel has been secured.

           The image is now robed in a holoku of yellow cotton, beneath
           which is an underskirt of striped silk in green and white.
           The arms are loosely jointed to the body.

           The performer in the hula, who stood behind a screen, by
           insinuating his hands under the clothing of the marionette,
           could impart to it such movements as were called for by the
           action of the play, while at the same time he repeated the
           words of his part, words supposed to be uttered by the
           marionette.

           The hula ki'i was, perhaps, the nearest approximation made by
           the Hawaiians to a genuine dramatic performance. Its usual
           instrument of musical accompaniment was the ipu, previously
           described. This drumlike object was handled by that division
           of the performers called the hoopa'a, who sat in full view of
           the audience manipulating the ipu in a quiet, sentimental
           manner, similar to that employed in the hula kuolo.

           As a sample of the stories illustrated in a performance of
           the hula ki'i the following may be adduced, the dramatis
           personae of which are four:

           1. _Maka-ku_: a famous warrior, a rude, strong-handed
           braggart, as boastful as Ajax.

           2. _Puapua-kea_, a small man, but brave and active.

           3. _Maile-lau-lii_ (Small-leafed-maile), a young woman, who
           becomes the wife of Maka-ku.

           4. _Maile-Pakaha_, the younger sister of Maile-lau-lii, who
           becomes the wife of Puapua-kea.

           Maka-ku, a rude and boastful son of Mars, at heart a bully,
           if not a coward, is represented as ever aching for a fight,
           in which his domineering spirit and rough-and-tumble ways for
           a time gave him the advantage over abler, but more modest,
           adversaries.

[Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY, BULLETIN 38 PLATE IX
               MARIONETTE, MAKA-KU]

[Page 93]

           Puapuakea, a man of genuine courage, hearing of the boastful
           achievements of Maka-ku, seeks him out and challenges him.

           At the first contest they fought with javelins, _ihe_, each
           one taking his turn according to lot in casting his javelins
           to the full tale of the prescribed number; after which the
           other contestant did the same. Neither was victorious.

           Next they fought with slings, each one having the right to
           sling forty stones at the other. In this conflict also
           neither one of them got the better of the other. The next
           trial was with stone-throwing. The result was still the same.

           Now it was for them to try the classical Hawaiian game of
           _lua_. This was a strenuous form of contest that has many
           features in common with the panathlion of the ancient
           Hellenes, some points in common with boxing, and still more,
           perhaps, partakes of the character of the grand art of
           combat, wrestling. Since becoming acquainted with the fine
           Japanese art of _jiu-jitsu_, the author recognizes certain
           methods that were shared by them both. But to all of these it
           added the wild privileges of choking, bone-breaking,
           dislocating, eye-gouging, and the infliction of tortures and
           grips unmentionable and disreputable. At first the conflict
           was in suspense, victory favoring neither party; but as the
           contest went on Puapuakea showed a slight superiority, and at
           the finish he had bettered Maka-ku by three points, or
           _ai_[205], as the Hawaiians uniquely term it.

           [Footnote 205: _Ai_, literally a food, a course.]

           The sisters, Maile-lau-lii and Maile-pakaha, who had been
           interested spectators of the contest, conceived a passionate
           liking for the two warriors and laid their plans in concert
           to capture them for themselves. Fortunately their preferences
           were not in conflict. Maile-lau-lii set her affections on
           Maka-ku, while the younger sister devoted herself to
           Pua-pua-kea.

           The two men had previously allowed their fancies to range
           abroad at pleasure; but from this time they centered their
           hearts on these two Mailes and settled down to regular
           married life.

           Interest in the actual performance of the hula ki'i was
           stimulated by a resort to byplay and buffoonery. One of the
           marionettes, for instance, points to some one in the
           audience; whereupon one of the _hoopaa_ asks, "What do you
           want?" The marionette persists in its pointing. At length the
           interlocutor, as if divining the marionette's wish, says:
           "Ah, you want So-and-so." At this the marionette nods assent,
           and the hoopaa asks again, "Do you wish him to come to you?"
           The marionette expresses its delight and approval by nods and
           gestures, to the immense satisfaction of the audience, who
           join in derisive laughter at the expense of the person held
           up to ridicule.

           Besides the marionettes already named among the characters
           found in the different hula-plays of the hula ki'i, the
[Page 94]  author has heard mention of the following marionettes: _Ku,
           Kini-ki'i, Hoo-lehelehe-ki'i, Ki'i-ki'i_, and _Nihi-aumoe_.

           Nihi-aumoe was a man without the incumbrance of a wife, an
           expert in the arts of intrigue and seduction. Nihi-aumoe is a
           word of very suggestive meaning, to walk softly at midnight.
           In Judge Andrews's dictionary are found the following
           pertinent Hawaiian verses apropos of the word _nihi_:

                E hoopono ka hele i ka uka o Puna;
                E _nihi_ ka hele, mai hoolawehala,
                Mai noho a ako i ka pua, o hewa,
                O inaina ke Akua, paa ke alanui,
                Aole ou ala e hiki aku ai.

                         [Translation]

                Look to your ways in upland Puna;
                Walk softly, commit no offense;
                Dally not, nor pluck the flower sin;
                Lest God in anger bar the road,
                And you find no way of escape.

           The marionette Ki'i-ki'i was a strenuous little fellow, an
           _ilamuku_, a marshal, or constable of the king. It was his
           duty to carry out with unrelenting rigor the commands of the
           alii, whether they bade him take possession of a taro patch,
           set fire to a house, or to steal upon a man at dead of night
           and dash out his brains while he slept.

           Referring to the illustrations (pl. VIII), a judge of human
           nature can almost read the character of the libertine
           Nihi-aumoe written in his features--the flattened vertex,
           indicative of lacking reverence and fear, the ruffian
           strength of the broad face; and if one could observe the
           reverse of the picture he would note the flattened back-head,
           a feature that marks a large number of Hawaiian crania.

           The songs that were cantillated to the hula ki'i express in
           some degree the peculiar libertinism of this hula, which
           differed from all others by many removes. They may be
           characterized as gossipy, sarcastic, ironical,
           scandal-mongering, dealing in satire, abuse, hitting right
           and left at social and personal vices--a cheese of rank
           flavor that is not to be partaken of too freely. It might be
           compared to the vaudeville in opera or to the genre picture
           in art.

                Mawi inquires, la, la!
                Who was her grand-sire? la, la!

                Wounded with spear, la, la!
                The same old wound, la, la!
                Wound made by Mawi, la, la!
[Page 96]
           15   The flag, lo the flag!             15
                The flag weeps at half-mast!
                The flag, indeed, asks--
                Many, many the flags,
                A scandal for number.
           20   Why are they overturned?           20
                Why their banners cast down?



           The author has met with several variants to this mele, which
           do not greatly change its character. In one of these variants
           the following changes are to be noted:

                Line 4. Pikaka[212] e ka luna, ke, ke!
                Line 5. Ka luna o ka hale, ke, ke!
                Line 8. Ka puka o ka hale, a ke, ke!
                Line 9. E noho i anei, a ke, ke!

           To attempt a translation of these lines which are
           unadulterated slang:

                Line 4. The roof is a-dry, la, la!
                Line 5. The roof of the house, la, la!
                Line 8. The door of the house, la, la!
                Line 9. Turn in this way, la, la!

           [Footnote 212: _Pikaka_ (full form _pikakao_). Dried up,
           juiceless.]

           The one who supplied the above lines expressed inability to
           understand their meaning, averring that they are "classical
           Hawaiian," meaning, doubtless, that they are archaic slang.
           As to the ninth line, the practice of "sitting in the door"
           seems to have been the fashion with such folk as far back as
           the time of Solomon.

           Let us picture this princess of Maui, this granddaughter of
           Wahieloa, Wewehi, as a Helen, with all of Helen's frailty, a
           flirt-errant, luxurious in life, quickly deserting one lover
           for the arms of another; yet withal of such humanity and
           kindness of fascination that, at her death, or absence, all
           things mourned her--not as Lycidas was mourned:

                "With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,
                .............................................
                And daffodillies fill their cups with tears,"

           but in some rude pagan fashion; all of which is wrought out
           and symbolized in the mele with such imagery as is native to
           the mind of the savage.

           The attentive reader will not need be told that, as in many
           another piece out of Hawaii's old-time legends, the path
           through this song is beset with euphuistic stumbling blocks.
           The purpose of language, says Talleyrand, is to conceal
           thought. The veil in this case is quite gauzy.

           The language of the following song for the marionette dance,
           hula ki'i, as in the one previously given, is mostly of that
[Page 97]  kind which the Hawaiians term _olelo kapekepeke_, or _olelo
           huna_, shifty talk, or secret talk. We might call it slang,
           though, it is not slang in the exact sense in which we use
           that word, applying it to the improvised counters of thought
           that gain currency in our daily speech until they find
           admission to the forum, the platform, and the dictionary. It
           is rather a cipher-speech, a method of concealing one's
           meaning from all but the initiated, of which the Hawaiian,
           whether alii or commoner, was very fond. The people of the
           hula were famous for this sort of accomplishment and prided
           themselves not a little in it as an effectual means of giving
           appropriate flavor and gusto to their performances.

                        _Mele_

                Ele-ele kau-kau;[213]
                Ka hala-le,[214] e kau-kau,
                Ka e-ele ihi,
                Ele ihi, ele a,
            5   Ka e-ele ku-pou;[215]
                Ku-pou.
                Ka hala, e![216]

                    [Translation]

                       _Song_

                Point to a dark one,
                Point to a dainty piece,
                A delicate morsel she!
                Very choice, very hot!
            5   She that stoops over--
                Aye stoops!
                Lo, the hala fruit!

           The translation has to be based largely on conjecture. The
           author of this bit of fun-making, which is couched in
           old-time slang, died without making known the key to his
           cipher, and no one whom the present writer has met with is
           able to unravel its full meaning.

           [Footnote 213: _Kau-kau_. Conjectural meaning to point out some
           one in the audience, as the marionettes often did. People
           were thus sometimes inveigled in behind the curtain.]

           [Footnote 214: _Hala-le_. Said to mean a sop, with which one
           took up the juice or gravy of food; a choice morsel.]

           [Footnote 215: _Ku-pou_. To stoop over, from devotion to one's
           own pursuits, from modesty, or from shame.]

           [Footnote 216: The meaning of this line has been matter for
           much conjecture. The author has finally adopted the
           suggestion embodied in the translation here given, which is a
           somewhat gross reference to the woman's physical charms.]

           The following mele for the hula ki'i, in language colored by
           the same motive, was furnished by an accomplished
           practitioner who had traveled far and wide in the practice of
           her art, having been one of a company of hula dancers that
           attended the Columbian exposition in Chicago. It was her good
[Page 98]  fortune also to reach the antipodes in her travels, and it
           was at Berlin, she says, that she witnessed for the first
           time the European counterpart of the hula ki'i, the "Punch
           and Judy" show:

                 _Mele no ka Hula Ki'i_

                E le'e kau-kau, kala le'e;
                E le'e kau-kau.
                E le'e kau-kau, kala le'e.
                E lepe kau-kau.
            5   E o-ku ana i kai;
                E u-au ai aku;
                E u-au ai aku;
                E u-au ai aku!
                E-he-he, e!

                          [Translation.]

                    _Song for the Hula Ki'i_

                Now for the dance, dance in accord;
                Prepare for the dance.
                Now for the dance, dance in time.
                Up, now, with the flag!
            5   Step out to the right
                Step out to the left!
                Ha, ha, ha!

           This translation is the result of much research, yet its
           absolute accuracy can not be vouched for. The most learned
           authorities (_kaka-olelo_) in old Hawaiian lore that have
           been found by the writer express themselves as greatly
           puzzled at the exact meaning of the mele just given. Some
           scholars, no doubt, would dub these nonsense-lines. The
           author can not consent to any such view. The old Hawaiians
           were too much in earnest to permit themselves to juggle with
           words in such fashion. They were fond of mystery and
           concealment, appreciated a joke, given to slang, but to
           string a lot of words together without meaning, after the
           fashion of a college student who delights to relieve his mind
           by shouting "Upidee, upida," was not their way. "The people
           of the hula," said one man, "had ways of fun-making peculiar
           to themselves."

           When the hula-dancer who communicated to the author the above
           song--a very accomplished and intelligent woman--was asked
           for information that would render possible its proper
           translation, she replied that her part was only that of a
           mouthpiece to repeat the words and to make appropriate
           gestures, _he pono hula wale no_, mere parrot-work. The
           language, she said, was such "classic" Hawaiian as to be
           beyond her understanding.
[Page 99]
           Here, again, is another song in argot, a coin of the same
           mintage as those just given:

                          _Mele_

                E kau-kau i hale manu, e!
                Ike oe i ka lola huluhulu, e?
                I ka huluhulu a we'uwe'u, e?
                I ka punohu,[217] e, a ka la e kau nei?
            5   Walea ka manu i ka wai, e!
                I ka wai lohi o ke kini, e!

                        [Translation]

                           _Song_

                Let's worship now the bird-cage.
                Seest thou the furzy woodland,
                The shag of herb and forest,
                The low earth-tinting rainbow,
            5   Child of the Sun that swings above?
