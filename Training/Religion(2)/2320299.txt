                              _Song_

                                 1

         Touched, thou art touched by my gesture, I fear, I fear.
         I dread your mountain of flesh, of flesh;
         How it sways, how it sways, it sways!
         I'm scorched by the heat of this hearth, this hearth.
     5   We bask in this summer of Kona, of Kona;
         Calm mantles the whispering sea, the whispering sea.
         Lo, the hook of the fisherman great, oh so great!
         The line hums as it runs from the gourd, from the gourd.
         Regard the cloud-omens over the sea, the sea.
    10   Well skilled in his craft is Mali'o, Mali'o.
         How grateful now were a draught of water, of water!
         Pardon! thou art touched by thrust of my leg, of my leg!

                                  2

         Forth and return, forth and return, forth and return!
         Now waft the woodland perfumes, the woodland perfumes.
    15   The house ere we entered was tenant-free, quite free.
         Heart-heavy we turn to the greenwood, the greenwood;
         This the place, Heart's desire, you should tarry,
         And feel the soft breath of the Unulau, Unulau--
         Retirement for you, retirement for me, and for him.
    20   We'll give then our heart to this task, this great task,
         And build in the wildwood a shrine, ay a shrine.
         You go; forget not the toils we have shared, have shared,
         Lest your bones lie unblest in the road, in the road.
         How wearisome, long, the road 'bout Hawaii, great Hawaii!
    25   Love carries me off with a rush, and I cry, I cry,
         Alas, I'm devoured by the shark, great shark!

           This is not the first time that a Hawaiian poet has figured
           love by the monster shark.

                            XXXV.--THE HULA KILU


           The hula _kilu_ was so called from being used in a sport
           bearing that name which was much patronized by the alii class
           of the ancient regime. It was a betting game, or, more
           strictly, forfeits were pledged, the payment of which was met
           by the performance of a dance, or by the exaction of kisses
           and embraces. The satisfaction of these forfeits not
           infrequently called for liberties and concessions that could
           not be permitted on the spot or in public, but must wait the
           opportunity of seclusion. There were, no doubt, times when
           the conduct of the game was carried to such a pitch of
           license as to offend decency; but as a rule the outward
           proprieties were seemingly as well regarded as at an
           old-fashioned husking bee, when the finding of the "red ear"
           conferred or imposed the privilege or penalty of exacting or
           granting the blushing tribute of a kiss. Actual improprieties
           were not witnessed.

           The game of kilu was played in an open matted space that lay
           between the two divisions of the audience--the women being on
           one side and the men on the other. Any chief of recognized
           rank in the _papa alii_ was permitted to join in the game;
           and kings and queens were not above participating in the
           pleasures of this sport. Once admitted to the hall or
           inclosure, all were peers and stood on an equal footing as to
           the rules and privileges of the game. King nor queen could
           plead exemption from the forfeits incurred nor deny to
           another the full exercise of privileges acquired under the
           rules.

           The players, five or more of each sex, having been selected
           by the president, _La anoano_ ("quiet day"), sat facing each
           other in the space between the spectators. In front of each
           player stood a conical block of heavy wood, broad at the base
           to keep it upright. The kilu, with which the game was played,
           was an oval, one-sided dish, made by cutting in two an
           egg-shaped coconut shell. The object of the player was to
           throw his kilu so that it should travel with a sliding and at
           the same time a rotary motion across the matted floor and hit
           the wooden block which stood before the one of his choice on
           the side opposite. The men and the women took turns in
           playing. A successful hit entitled the player to claim a kiss
           from his opponent, a toll which was exacted at once. Success
           in winning ten points made one the victor in the game, and,
           according to some, entitled him to claim the larger forfeit,
[Page 236] such as was customary in the democratic game of _ume_. The
           payment of these extreme forfeits was delayed till a
           convenient season, or might be commuted---on grounds of
           policy, or at the request of the loser, if a king or
           queen--by an equivalent of land or other valuable possession.
           Still no fault could be found if the winner insisted on the
           strict payment of the forfeit.

           The game of kilu was often got up as a compliment, a supreme
           expression of hospitality, to distinguished visitors of rank,
           thus more than making good the polite phrase of the Spanish
           don, "all that I have is yours."

           The fact that the hula kilu was performed by the alii class,
           who took great pains and by assiduous practice made
           themselves proficient that they might be ready to exhibit
           their accomplishment before the public, was a guarantee that
           this hula, when performed by them, would be of more than
           usual grace and vivacity. When performed in the halau as a
           tabu dance, according to some, the olapa alone took part, and
           the number of dancers, never very large, was at times limited
           to one performer. Authorities differ as to whether any
           musical instrument was used as an accompaniment. From an
           allusion to this dance met with in an old story it is quite
           certain that the drum was sometimes used as an accompaniment.

           Let us picture to ourselves the scene: A shadowy,
           flower-scented hall; the elite of some Hawaiian court and
           their guests, gathered, in accord with old-time practice, to
           contend in a tournament of wit and grace and skill, vying
           with one another for the prize of beauty. The president has
           established order in the assembly; the opposing players have
           taken their stations, each one seated behind his
           target-block. The tallykeeper of one side now makes the
           challenge. "This kilu," says he, "is a love token; the
           forfeit a kiss." An Apollo of the opposite side joyfully
           takes up the gauge. His tallykeeper introduces him by name.
           He plumes himself like a wild bird of gay feather, standing
           forth in the decorous finery of his rank, girded and
           flowerbedecked after the manner of the halau, eager to win
           applause for his party not less than to secure for himself
           the loving reward of victory. In his hand is the instrument
           of the play, the kilu; the artillery of love, however, with
           which he is to assail the heart and warm the imagination of
           the fair woman opposed to him is the song he shoots from his
           lips.

           The story of the two songs next to be presented is one, and
           will show us a side of Hawaiian life on which we can not
           afford entirely to close our eyes. During the stay at Lahaina
           of Kamehameha, called the Great--whom an informant in this
           matter always calls "the murderer," in protest against the
           treacherous assassination of Keoua, which took place at
           Kawaihae in Kamehameha's very presence--a high chiefess of
           his court named Kalola engaged in a love affair with a young
[Page 237] man of rank named Ka'i-ama. He was much her junior, but this
           did not prevent his infatuation. Early one morning she rose,
           leaving him sound asleep, and took canoe for Molokai to serve
           as one of the escort to the body of her relative, Keola, on
           the way to its place of sepulture.

           Some woman, appreciating the situation, posted to the house
           and waked the sleeper with the information. Ka'iama hastened
           to the shore, and as he strained his vision to gain sight of
           the woman of his infatuation the men at the paddles and the
           bristling throng on the central platform--the _pola_--of the
           craft, vanishing in the twilight, made on his imagination the
           impression of a hazy mountain thicket floating on the waves,
           but hiding from view some rare flower. He gave vent to his
           feelings in song:

                                _Mele_

                Pua ehu kamalena[452] ka uka o Kapa'a;
                Luhi-ehu iho la[453] ka pua i Maile-huna;
                Hele a ha ka iwi[454] a ke Koolau,
                Ke pua mai i ka maka o ka nahelehele,
            5   I hali hoo-muu,[455] hoohalana i Wailua.
                Pa kahea a Koolau-wahine,
                O Pua-ke'i, e-e-e-e!
                He pua laukona[456] ka moe e aloh' ai;
                O ia moe la, e kaulele hou[457]
           10   No ka po i hala aku aku nei.
                Hoiho kaua a eloelo, e ka hoa, e,
                A hookahi!

                                [Translation]

                                    _Song_

                Misty and dim, a bush in the wilds of Kapa'a,
                The paddlers bend to their work, as the flower-laden
                Shrub inclines to the earth in Maile-huna;
                They sway like reeds in the breeze to crack their bones
            5   Such the sight as I look at this tossing grove,
                The rhythmic dip and swing on to Wailua.
                My call to the witch shall fly with the breeze,
                Shall be heard at Pua-ke'i, e-he, e-he!
                The flower-stalk Laukona beguiles man to love,
           10   Can bring back the taste of joys once our own,
[Page 238]      Make real again the hours that are flown.
                Turn hither, mine own, let's drench us with love--
                Just for one night!

           [Footnote 452: _Pua ehu Kamalena_ (yellow child). This
           exclamation is descriptive of the man's visual impression on
           seeing the canoe with its crowd of passengers and paddlers,
           in the misty light of morning, receding in the distance. The
           kamalena is a mountain shrub having a yellow flower.]

           [Footnote 453: _Luhi ehu iho la_. Refers to the drooping of a
           shrub under the weight of its leaves and flowers, a figure
           applied to the bending of the paddlemen to their work.]

           [Footnote 454: _Hele a ha ka iwi_. An exaggerated figure of
           speech, referring to the exertions of the men at their
           paddles (_ha_, to strain).]

           [Footnote 455: _I hali hoomu_. This refers in a fine spirit of
           exaggeration to the regular motions of the paddlers.]

           [Footnote 456: _Pua laukona_. A kind of sugar-cane which was
           prescribed and used by the kahunas as an aphrodisiac.]

           [Footnote 457: _Kaulele hou_. To experience, or to enjoy,
           again.]

           The unchivalrous indiscretion of the youth in publishing the
           secret of his amour elicited from Kamehameha only the
           sarcastic remark, "Couldn't he eat his food and keep his
           mouth shut?" The lady herself took the same view of his
           action. There was no evasion in her reply; her only reproach
           was for his childishness in blabbing.

                                      _Mele_

                Kalakalaihi, kaha[458] ka La ma ke kua o Lehua;
                Lulana iho la ka pihe a ke Akua;[459]
                Ea mai ka Unulau[460] o Halali'i;

                I ike aku no i ka uwe ana iho;
           10   Pela wale no ka hoa kamalii, e-e, a!

                                   [Translation]

                                       _Song_

                The sun-furrow gleams at the back of Lehua;
                The King's had his fill of scandal and chaff;
                The wind-god empties his lungs with a laugh;
                And the Mikioi tosses the sea at Lehua,
            5   As the trade-wind wafts his friend on her way--
                A congress of airs that ruffles the bay.
                Hide love 'neath a mask--that's all I would ask.
                To spill but a tear makes our love-tale appear;
                He pours out his woe; I've seen it, I know;
           10   That's the way with a boy-friend, heigh-ho!

           The art of translating from the Hawaiian into the English
           tongue consists largely in a fitting substitution of generic
           for specific terms. The Hawaiian, for instance, had at
           command scores of specific names for the same wind, or for
[Page 239] the local modifications that were inflicted upon it by the
           features of the landscape. One might almost say that every
           cape and headland imposed a new nomenclature upon the breeze
           whose direction it influenced. He rarely contented himself
           with using a broad and comprehensive term when he could match
           the situation with a special form.

           [Footnote 458: The picture of the sun declining, _kaha_, to the
           west, its reflected light-track, _kala kalaihi_, farrowing
           the ocean with glory, may be taken to be figurative of the
           loved and beautiful woman, Kalola, speeding on her westward
           canoe-flight.]

           [Footnote 459: _Akua_. Literally a god, must stand for the
           king.]

           [Footnote 460: _Unulau_. A special name for the trade-wind.]

           [Footnote 461: _Koolau-wahine_. Likewise another name for the
           trade-wind, here represented as carrying off the (man's)
           companion.]

           [Footnote 462: _Mikioi_. An impetuous, gusty wind is
           represented as lashing the ocean at Lehua, thus picturing the
           emotional stir attending Kalola's departure.]

           [Footnote 463: The words _Puwa-i'a na hoa makani_, which
           literally mean that the congress of winds, _na hoa makani_,
           have stirred up a commotion, even as a school of fish agitate
           the surface, of the ocean, _puwa-i'a_, refer to the scandal
           caused by Ka'i-ama's conduct.]

           The singer restricts her blame to charging her youthful lover
           with an indiscreet exhibition of childish emotion. The mere
           display of emotion evinced by the shedding of tears was in
           itself a laudable action and in good form.

           This first reply of the woman to her youthful lover did not
           by any means exhaust her armament of retaliation. When she
           next treats of the affair it is with an added touch of
           sarcasm and yet with a sang-froid that proved it had not
           unsettled her nerves.

                                _Mele_

                That eats of the aphrodisiac cane,
            5   And then boasts the privileged bed.
                He makes me a creature of outlaw:
                True to myself from crown to foot-sole,
                My love I've kept sacred, pent up within.

           10   That is the way with a child-friend;
                A child just blubbers at nothing.

           [Footnote 464: _Kala'e-loa_. The full name of the place on
           Molokai now known as Kala'e.]

           [Footnote 465: _La'i a ka manu_. Some claim this to be a proper
           name, _La'i-a-ka-manu_, that of a place near Kala'e. However
           that may be the poet evidently uses the phrase here in its
           etymological sense.]

           To return to the description of the game, the player, having
           uttered his vaunt in true knightly fashion, with a dexterous
           whirl now sends his kilu spinning on its course. If his play
           is successful and the kilu strikes the target on the other
[Page 240] side at which he aims, the audience, who have kept silence
           till now, break forth in applause, and his tally-keeper
           proclaims his success in boastful fashion:

                          _Oli_

                A uweuwe ke ko'e a ke kae;
                Puehuehu ka la, komo inoino;
                Kakia, kahe ka ua ilalo.

                       [Translation]

                Now wriggles the worm to its goal;
                A tousling; a hasty encounter;
                A grapple; down falls the rain.

           It is now the winner's right to cross over and claim his
           forfeit. The audience deals out applause or derision in
           unstinted measure; the enthusiasm reaches fever-point when
           some one makes himself the champion of the game by bringing
           his score up to ten, the limit. The play is often kept up
           till morning, to be resumed the following night.[466]

           [Footnote 466: The account above given is largely based on
           David Malo's description of the game kilu. In his confessedly
           imperfect list of the hulas he does not mention the hula
           kilu. This hula was, however, included in the list of hulas
           announced for performance in the programme of King Kalakaua's
           coronation ceremonies.]

           Here also is a mele, which tradition reports to have been
           cantillated by Hiiaka, the sister of Pele, during her famous
           kilu contest with the Princess Pele-ula, which took place at
           Kou--the ancient name for Honolulu--on Hiiaka's voyage of
           return from Kauai to her sister's court at Kilauea. In this
           affair Lohiau and Wahineoma'o contended on the side of
           Hiiaka, while Pele-ula was assisted by her husband, Kou, and
           by other experts. But on this occasion the dice were cogged;
           the victory was won not by human skill but by the magical
           power of Hiiaka, who turned Pele-ula's kilu away from the
           target each time she threw it, but used her gift to compel it
           to the mark when the kilu was cast by herself.

           [Footnote 467: _Ka-lalau_ (in the translation by the omission

           only at certain times of the year by boats and by a steep
           mountain trail at its head.]

           [Footnote 468: _Pali ku'i_. _Ku'i_ means literally to join

           abounded in such places.]

                Comrade mine in the robe-stripping gusts of Lalau,
                On the up-piled beetling cliffs of Makua,
                The ladder... is taken away... it is gone!
                Your way is cut off, my man!
            5   With you I've backed the uhu of Maka-pu'u,
                Tugging them up the steeps of Point-o'-woods,
                A cliff that stands fatherless, even as
                Sheer stands the pali of Ula-mao--
                And thus... you are lost!

           This is but a fragment of the song which Hiiaka pours out in
           her efforts to calm the fateful storm which she saw piling up
           along the horizon. The situation was tragic. Hiiaka, daring
           fate, defying the dragons and monsters of the primeval world,
           had made the journey to Kauai, had snatched away from death
           the life of Lohiau and with incredible self-denial was
           escorting the rare youth to the arms of her sister, whose
           jealousy she knew to be quick as the lightning, her vengeance
           hot as the breath of the volcano, and now she saw this
           featherhead, with monstrous ingratitude, dallying with fate,
           calling down upon the whole party the doom she alone could
           appreciate, all for the smile of a siren whose charms
           attracted him for the moment; but, worst of all, her heart
           condemned her as a traitress--she loved him.

           Hiiaka held the trick-card and she won; by her miraculous
           power she kept the game in her own hands and foiled the hopes
           of the lovers.
