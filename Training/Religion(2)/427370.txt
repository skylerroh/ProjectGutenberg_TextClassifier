      From selfishness, sinfulness, dearth,
    From vanity, folly, and all that is wrong--
      With ambition that binds us to earth;

    To kindly pass over a wound, or a foe
      (And mem'ry but part us awhile),
    To breathe forth a prayer that His love I may know,
      Whose mercies my sorrows beguile,--

    If these resolutions are acted up to,
      And faith spreads her pinions abroad,
    'Twill be sweet when I ponder the days may be few
      That waft me away to my God.

_O FOR THY WINGS, SWEET BIRD!_


    O for thy wings, sweet bird!
      And soul of melody by being blest--
    Like thee, my voice had stirred
      Some dear remembrance in a weary breast.

    But whither wouldst thou rove,
      Bird of the airy wing, and fold thy plumes?
    In what dark leafy grove
      Wouldst chant thy vespers 'mid rich glooms?

    Or sing thy love-lorn note--
      In deeper solitude, where nymph or saint
    Has wooed some mystic spot,
      Divinely desolate the shrine to paint?

    Yet wherefore ask thy doom?
      Blessed compared with me thou art--
    Unto thy greenwood home
      Bearing no bitter memory at heart;

    Wearing no earthly chain,
      Thou canst in azure bright soar far above;
    Nor pinest thou in vain
      O'er joys departed, unforgotten love.

    O take me to thy bower!
      Beguile the lagging hours of weariness
    With strain which hath strange power
      To make me love thee as I love life less!

    From mortal consciousness
      Which binds to earth--infirmity of woe!
    Or pining tenderness--
      Whose streams will never dry or cease to flow;

    An aching, voiceless void,
      Hushed in the heart whereunto none reply,
    And in the cringing crowd
      Companionless! Bird, bear me through the sky!

_COME THOU_


    Come, in the minstrel's lay;
      When two hearts meet,
      And true hearts greet,
    And all is morn and May.

    Come Thou! and now, anew,
      To thought and deed
      Give sober speed,
    Thy will to know, and do.

    Stay! till the storms are o'er--
      The cold blasts done,
      The reign of heaven begun,
    And Love, the evermore.

    Be patient, waiting heart:
      Light, Love divine
      Is here, and thine;
    You therefore cannot part.

    "The seasons come and go:
      Love, like the sea,
      Rolls on with thee,--
    But knows no ebb and flow.

    "Faith, hope, and tears, triune,
      Above the sod
      Find peace in God,
    And one eternal noon."

    Oh, Thou hast heard my prayer;
      And I am blest!
      This is Thy high behest:
    Thou, here and _everywhere_.




_WISH AND ITEM_

    To the editor of the _Item_, Lynn, Mass.


    I hope the heart that's hungry
      For things above the floor,
    Will find within its portals
      An item rich in store;

    That melancholy mortals
      Will count their mercies o'er,
    And learn that Truth and wisdom
      Have many items more;

    That when a wrong is done us,
      It stirs no thought of strife;
    And Love becomes the substance,
      As item, of our life;

    That every ragged urchin,
      With bare feet soiled or sore,
    Share God's most tender mercies,--
      Find items at our door.

    Then if we've done to others
      Some good ne'er told before,
    When angels shall repeat it,
      'Twill be an item more.




_DEDICATION OF A TEMPERANCE HALL_


    Author of all divine
      Gifts, lofty, pure, and free,
    Temperance and truth in song sublime
      An offering bring to Thee!

    A temple, whose high dome
      Rose from a water-cup;
    And from its altar to Thy throne
      May we press on and up!

    And she--last at the cross,
      First at the tomb, who waits--
    Woman--will watch to cleanse from dross
      The cause she elevates.

    Sons of the old Bay State,
      Work for our glorious cause!
    And be your waiting hearts elate,
      Since temperance makes your laws.

    "Temples of Honor," all,
      "Social," or grand, or great,
    This blazoned, brilliant temperance hall
      To Thee we dedicate.

    "Good Templars" one and all,
    Good "Sons," and daughters, too,
    We dedicate this temperance hall
    To God, to Truth, and you!

_LINES_

    Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer.--_Moore._

    Was that fold for the lambkin soft virtue's repose,
    Where the weary and earth-stricken lay down their woes,--
    When the fountain and leaflet are frozen and sere,
    And the mountains more friendless,--their home is not here?

    When the herd had forsaken, and left them to stray
    From the green sunny slopes of the woodland away;
    Where the music of waters had fled to the sea,
    And this life but one given to suffer and be?

    Was it then thou didst call them to banish all pain,
    And the harpstring, just breaking, reecho again
    To a strain of enchantment that flowed as the wave,
    Where they waited to welcome the murmur it gave?

    Oh, there's never a shadow where sunshine is not,
    And never the sunshine without a dark spot;
    Yet there's one will be victor, for glory and fame,
    Without heart to define them, were only a name!

_TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHILDREN_

_Who sent me the picture depictive of Isaiah xi._


    Jesus loves you! so does mother:
      Glad thy Eastertide:
    Loving God and one another,
      You in Him abide.
    Ours through Him who gave you to us,--
      Gentle as the dove,
    Fondling e'en the lion furious,
      Leading kine with love.

    Father, in Thy great heart hold them
      Ever thus as Thine!
    Shield and guide and guard them; and, when
      At some siren shrine
    They would lay their pure hearts' off'ring,
      Light with wisdom's ray--
    Beacon beams--athwart the weakly,
      Rough or treacherous way.
