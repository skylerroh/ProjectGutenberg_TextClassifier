_How would you define Christian Science?_

As the law of God, the law of good, interpreting and demonstrating the
divine Principle and rule of universal harmony.


_What is the Principle of Christian Science?_

It is God, the Supreme Being, infinite and immortal Mind, the Soul of man
and the universe. It is our Father which is in heaven. It is substance,
Spirit, Life, Truth, and Love,--these are the deific Principle.
