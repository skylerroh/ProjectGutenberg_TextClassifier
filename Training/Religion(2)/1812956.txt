
The whole of the sixth book is devoted to showing that gifts
are made to proper persons not through sympathy but on account
of the injunction of the scriptures, the enumeration of certain
Vedic performances, which brings in ad@r@s@ta, purification and impurities
of things, how passions are often generated by ad@r@s@ta,
how dharma and adharma lead to birth and death and how mok@sa
takes place as a result of the work of the soul.

In the seventh book it is said that the qualities in eternal
things are eternal and in non-eternal things non-eternal. The
change of qualities produced by heat in earth has its beginning
in the cause (the atoms). Atomic size is invisible while great size
is visible. Visibility is due to a thing's being made up of many
causes [Footnote ref 1], but the atom is therefore different from those
that have great size. The same thing may be called great and small
relatively at the same time. In accordance with a@nutva (atomic) and
mahattva (great) there are also the notions of small and big. The
eternal size of _parima@n@dala_ (round) belongs to the atoms. Akas'a
and atman are called _mahan_ or _paramamahan_ (the supremely
great or all-pervasive); since manas is not of the great measure
it is of atomic size. Space and time are also considered as being
of the measure "supremely great" (paramamahat), Atomic size
(parima@n@dala) belonging to the atoms and the mind (manas) and
the supremely great size belonging to space, time, soul and ether
(akas'a) are regarded as eternal.

In the second chapter of the seventh book it is said that unity
and separateness are to be admitted as entities distinct from
other qualities. There is no number in movement and quality;
the appearance of number in them is false. Cause and effect are

_________________________________________________________________

[Footnote 1: I have differed from the _Upaskara_ in the interpretation of
this sutra.]

293

neither one, nor have they distinctive separateness (_ekap@rthaktva_).
The notion of unity is the cause of the notion of duality, etc.
Contact may be due to the action of one or two things, or the
effect of another contact and so is disjoining. There is neither
contact nor disjoining in cause and effect since they do not exist
independently (_yutasiddhyabhavat_). In the eighth book it is said
that soul and manas are not perceptible, and that in the apprehension
of qualities, action, generality, and particularity
perception is due to their contact with the thing. Earth is the
cause of perception of smell, and water, fire, and air are the
cause of taste, colour and touch[Footnote ref 1]. In the ninth book
negation is described; non-existence (_asat_) is defined as that to
which neither action nor quality can be attributed. Even existent things
may become non-existent and that which is existent in one
way may be non-existent in another; but there is another kind
of non-existence which is different from the above kinds of
existence and non-existence [Footnote ref 2]. All negation can be directly
perceived through the help of the memory which keeps before the
mind the thing to which the negation applies. Allusion is also
made in this connection to the special perceptual powers of the
yogins (sages attaining mystical powers through Yoga practices).

In the second chapter the nature of hetu (reason) or the
middle term is described. It is said that anything connected
with any other thing, as effect, cause, as in contact, or as contrary
or as inseparably connected, will serve as li@nga (reason).
The main point is the notion "this is associated with this," or
"these two are related as cause and effect," and since this may
also be produced through premisses, there may be a formal syllogism
from propositions fulfilling the above condition. Verbal
cognition comes without inference. False knowledge (_avidya_) is
due to the defect of the senses or non-observation and mal-observation
due to wrong expectant impressions. The opposite
of this is true knowledge (_vidya_). In the tenth it is said that
pleasure and pain are not cognitions, since they are not related to
doubt and certainty.

____________________________________________________________________

[Footnote 1: _Upaskara_ here explains that it is intended that the senses
are produced by those specific elements, but this cannot be found in the
sutras.]

[Footnote 2: In the previous three kinds of non-existence, _pragabhava_
(negation before production), _dhvamsabhava_ (negation after destruction),
and _anyonyabhava_ (mutual negation of each other in each other), have
been described. The fourth one is _samanyabhava_ (general negation).]

294


A dravya may be caused by the inhering of the effect in it, for
because of its contact with another thing the effect is produced.
Karma (motion) is also a cause since it inheres in the cause. Contact
is also a cause since it inheres in the cause. A contact which
inheres in the cause of the cause and thereby helps the production
of the effect is also a cause. The special quality of the heat of
fire is also a cause.

Works according to the injunctions of the scriptures since they
have no visible effect are the cause of prosperity, and because the
Vedas direct them, they have validity.


Philosophy in the Nyaya sutras [Footnote ref 1].

The _Nyaya sutras_ begin with an enumeration of the sixteen
subjects, viz. means of right knowledge (_prama@na_), object of right
knowledge (_prameya_), doubt (_sa@ms'aya_), purpose (_prayojana_),
illustrative instances (_d@r@s@tanta_), accepted conclusions (_siddhanta_),
premisses (_avayava_), argumentation (_tarka_), ascertainment (_nir@naya_),
debates (_vada_), disputations (_jalpa_), destructive criticisms
(_vita@n@da_), fallacy (_hetvabhasa_), quibble (_chala_), refutations
(_jati_), points of opponent's defeat (_nigrahasthana_), and hold that
by a thorough knowledge of these the highest good (_nihs'reyasa_), is
attained. In the second sutra it is said that salvation (_apavarga_)
is attained by the successive disappearance of false knowledge
(_mithyajnana_), defects (_do@sa_), endeavours (_prav@rtti_, birth
(_janma_), and ultimately of sorrow. Then the means of proof are said
to be of four kinds, perception (_pratyak@sa_), inference (_anumana_),
analogy (_upamana_), and testimony (_s'abda_). Perception is defined
as uncontradicted determinate knowledge unassociated with names
proceeding out of sense contact with objects. Inference is of three
kinds, from cause to effect (_purvavat_), effect to cause (_s'e@savat_),
and inference from common characteristics (_samanyato d@r@s@ta_).
Upamana is the knowing of anything by similarity with any well-known
thing.

S'abda is defined as the testimony of reliable authority (apta)
[Footnote ref 2].

___________________________________________________________________

[Footnote 1: This is a brief summary of the doctrines found in _Nyaya
sutras_, supplemented here and there with the views of Vatsyayana, the
commentator. This follows the order of the sutras, and tries to present
their ideas with as little additions from those of later day Nyaya as
possible. The general treatment of Nyaya-Vais'e@sika expounds the two
systems in the light of later writers and commentators.]

[Footnote 2: It is curious to notice that Vatsyayana says that an arya, a
@r@si or a mleccha (foreigner), may be an apta (reliable authority).]

295

Such a testimony may tell us about things which may be experienced
and which are beyond experience. Objects of knowledge
are said to be self (_atman_), body, senses, sense-objects,
understanding (_buddhi_), mind (_manas_}, endeavour (prav@rtti), rebirths,
enjoyment of pleasure and suffering of pain, sorrow and
salvation. Desire, antipathy, effort (_prayatna_), pleasure, pain, and
knowledge indicate the existence of the self. Body is that which
upholds movement, the senses and the rise of pleasure and pain
as arising out of the contact of sense with sense-objects [Footnote ref l];
the five senses are derived from the five elements, such as prthivi, ap,
tejas, vayu and akas'a; smell, taste, colour, touch, and sound are
the qualities of the above five elements, and these are also the
objects of the senses. The fact that many cognitions cannot
occur at any one moment indicates the existence of mind (_manas_).
Endeavour means what is done by speech, understanding, and
body. Do@sas (attachment, antipathy, etc) are those which lead
men to virtue and vice. Pain is that which causes suffering [Footnote ref
2]. Ultimate cessation from pain is called _apavarga_ [Footnote ref 3].
Doubt arises when through confusion of similar qualities or conflicting
opinions etc., one wants to settle one of the two alternatives. That
for attaining which, or for giving up which one sets himself to work
is called _prayojana_.

Illustrative example (_d@r@s@tanta_) is that on which both the
common man and the expert (_parik@saka_) hold the same opinion.
Established texts or conclusions (_siddhanta_) are of four kinds,
viz (1) those which are accepted by all schools of thought called
the _sarvatantrasiddhanta_; (2) those which are held by one school
or similar schools but opposed by others called the _pratitantrasiddhanta_;
(3) those which being accepted other conclusions will also naturally
follow called _adhikara@nasiddhanta_; (4) those of the opponent's views
which are uncritically granted by a debater, who proceeds then to refute
the consequences that follow and thereby show his own special skill and
bring the opponent's intellect to disrepute (_abhyupagamasiddhanta_)
[Footnote ref 4]. The premisses are five:

__________________________________________________________________

[Footnote 1: Here I have followed Vatsyayana's meaning.]

[Footnote 2: Vatsyayana comments here that when one finds all things full
of misery, he wishes to avoid misery, and finding birth to be associated
with pain becomes unattached and thus is emancipated.]

[Footnote 3: Vatsyayana wants to emphasise that there is no bliss in
salvation, but only cessation from pain.]

[Footnote 4: I have followed Vatsyayana's interpretation here.]

(1) _pratijna_ (the first enunciation of the thing to be proved);
(2) _hetu_ (the reason which establishes the conclusion on the
strength of the similarity of the case in hand with known examples
or negative instances); (3) _udahara@na_ (positive or negative
illustrative instances); (4) _upanaya_ (corroboration by the instance);
(5) _nigamana_ (to reach the conclusion which has been proved).
Then come the definitions of tarka, nir@naya, vada, jalpa, vita@n@da,
the fallacies (hetvabhasa), chala, jati, and nigrahasthana, which
have been enumerated in the first sutra.

The second book deals with the refutations of objections
against the means of right knowledge (pramana). In refutation
of certain objections against the possibility of the happening
of doubt, which held that doubt could not happen, since there
was always a difference between the two things regarding which
doubt arose, it is held that doubt arises when the special differentiating
characteristics between the two things are not noted.
Certain objectors, probably the Buddhists, are supposed to object
to the validity of the prama@na in general and particularly of
perceptions on the ground that if they were generated before
the sense-object contact, they could not be due to the latter,
and if they are produced after the sense-object contact, they
could not establish the nature of the objects, and if the two
happened together then there would be no notion of succession
in our cognitions. To this the Nyaya reply is that if there were
no means of right knowledge, then there would be no means of
knowledge by means of which the objector would refute all
means of right knowledge; if the objector presumes to have any
means of valid knowledge then he cannot say that there are no
means of valid knowledge at all. Just as from the diverse kinds
of sounds of different musical instruments, one can infer the previous
existence of those different kinds of musical instruments,
so from our knowledge of objects we can infer the previous existence
of those objects of knowledge [Footnote ref 1].

The same things (e.g. the senses, etc.) which are regarded as
instruments of right knowledge with reference to the right cognition
of other things may themselves be the objects of right

knowledge. There are no hard and fast limits that those which
are instruments of knowledge should always be treated as mere
instruments, for they themselves may be objects of right knowledge.
The means of right knowledge (prama@na) do not require
other sets of means for revealing them, for they like the light of
a lamp in revealing the objects of right knowledge reveal themselves
as well.

Coming to the question of the correctness of the definition
of perception, it is held that the definition includes the contact
of the soul with the mind [Footnote ref 1]. Then it is said that though we
perceive only parts of things, yet since there is a whole, the perception
of the part will naturally refer to the whole. Since we
can pull and draw things wholes exist, and the whole is not
merely the parts collected together, for were it so one could
say that we perceived the ultimate parts or the atoms [Footnote ref 2].
Some objectors hold that since there may be a plurality of causes it is
wrong to infer particular causes from particular effects. To this
the Nyaya answer is that there is always such a difference in the
specific nature of each effect that if properly observed each particular
effect will lead us to a correct inference of its own particular
cause [Footnote ref 3]. In refuting those who object to the existence of
time on the ground of relativity, it is said that if the present time
did not exist, then no perception of it would have been possible.
The past and future also exist, for otherwise we should not have
perceived things as being done in the past or as going to be
done in the future. The validity of analogy (upamana) as a
means of knowledge and the validity of the Vedas is then proved.
The four prama@nas of perception, inference, analogy, and scripture

interpolations to answer criticisms, not against the Nyaya doctrine
of perception, but against the wording of the definition
of perception as given in the,_Nyaya sutra_, II. i. 4.]

[Footnote 2: This is a refutation of the doctrines of the Buddhists, who
rejected the existence of wholes (avayavi). On this subject a later
Buddhist monograph by Pandita As'oka (9th century A.D.),
_Avayavinirakara@na_ in _Six Buddhist Nyaya Tracts_, may be referred
to.]

is not made merely from seeing the rise of water, but from the rainwater
augmenting the previous water of the river and carrying with its current
large quantities of foam, fruits, leaves, wood, etc. These characteristics,
associated with the rise of water, mark it as a special kind of rise of
water, which can only be due to the happening of rain up the river].

are quite sufficient and it is needless to accept arthapatti (implication),
aitihya (tradition), sambhava (when a thing is understood
in terms of higher measure the lower measure contained in it is
also understood--if we know that there is a bushel of corn anywhere
we understand that the same contains eight gallons of
corn as well) and abhava (non-existence) as separate prama@nas
for the tradition is included in verbal testimony and arthapatti,
sambhava and abhava are included within inference.

The validity of these as prama@nas is recognized, but they are
said to be included in the four prama@nas mentioned before. The
theory of the eternity of sound is then refuted and the non-eternity
proved in great detail. The meaning of words is said to
refer to class-notions (_jati_), individuals (_vyakti_), and the specific
position of the limbs (_ak@rti_), by which the class notion is manifested.
Class (_jati_} is defined as that which produces the notion
of sameness (_samanaprasavatmika jati@h_).

The third book begins with the proofs for the existence of
the self or atman. It is said that each of the senses is associated
with its own specific object, but there must exist some other entity
in us which gathered together the different sense-cognitions and
produced the perception of the total object as distinguished from
the separate sense-perceptions. If there were no self then there
would be no sin in injuring the bodies of men: again if there
were no permanent self, no one would be able to recognize
things as having seen them before; the two images produced by
the eyes in visual perception could not also have been united
together as one visual perception of the things [Footnote ref 1]; moreover
if there were no permanent cognizer then by the sight of a sour
fruit one could not be reminded of its sour taste. If consciousness
belonged to the senses only, then there would be no recognition,
for the experience of one could not be recognized by another.
If it is said that the unity of sensations could as well be effected
by manas (mind), then the manas would serve the same purpose
as self and it would only be a quarrel over a name, for this
entity the knower would require some instrument by which it
would co-ordinate the sensations and cognize; unless manas is
admitted as a separate instrument of the soul, then though the
sense perceptions could be explained as being the work of the

__________________________________________________________________

[Footnote 1: According to Vatsyayana, in the two eyes we have two different
senses. Udyotakara, however, thinks that there is one visual sense which
works in both eyes.]

299

senses, yet imagining, thinking, etc., could not be explained.
Another argument for the admission of soul is this, that infants
show signs of pleasure and pain in quite early stages of infancy
and this could not be due to anything but similar experiences in
previous lives. Moreover every creature is born with some desires,
and no one is seen to be born without desires. All attachments
and desires are due to previous experiences, and therefore it is
argued that desires in infants are due to their experience in
previous existences.

The body is made up of the k@siti element. The visual sense
is material and so also are all other senses [Footnote ref l]. Incidentally
the view held by some that the skin is the only organ of sensation
is also refuted. The earth possesses four qualities, water three,
fire two, air one, and ether one, but the sense of smell, taste, eye,
and touch which are made respectively by the four elements of
earth, etc., can only grasp the distinctive features of the elements
of which they are made. Thus though the organ of smell is made
by earth which contains four qualities, it can only grasp the distinctive
quality of earth, viz. smell.

Against the Sa@mkhya distinction of _buddhi_ (cognition) and
_cit_ (pure intelligence) it is said that there is no difference between
the _buddhi_ and _cit_. We do not find in our consciousness two
elements of a phenomenal and a non-phenomenal consciousness,
but only one, by whichever name it may be called. The Sa@mkhya
epistemology that the anta@hkara@na assumes diverse forms in
cognitive acts is also denied, and these are explained on the supposition
of contacts of manas with the senses, atman and external
objects. The Buddhist objection against the Sa@mkhya explanation
that the anta@hkara@nas catch reflection from the external
world just as a crystal does from the coloured objects that may
lie near it, that there were really momentary productions of
crystals and no permanent crystal catching different reflections at
different times is refuted by Nyaya; for it says that it cannot be
said that all creations are momentary, but it can only be agreed to
in those cases where momentariness was actually experienced.
In the case of the transformation of milk into curd there is no
coming in of new qualities and disappearance of old ones, but

___________________________________________________________________

[Footnote 1: It is well to remember that Sa@mkhya did not believe that the
senses were constituted of the gross elements. But the Sa@mkhya-Yoga view
represented in _Atreya-sa@mhita_ (Caraka) regarded the senses as bhautika
or constituted of the gross elements.]

300

the old milk is destroyed and the curd originates anew. The
contact of manas with soul (_atman_) takes place within the body
and not in that part of atman which is outside the body; knowledge
belongs to the self and not to the senses or the object for
even when they are destroyed knowledge remains. New cognitions
destroy the old ones. No two recollections can be simultaneous.
Desire and antipathy also belong to the soul. None of
these can belong either to the body or to the mind (manas).
Manas cannot be conscious for it is dependent upon self. Again
if it was conscious then the actions done by it would have to be
borne by the self and one cannot reap the fruits of the actions of
another. The causes of recollection on the part of self are given
as follows: (1) attention, (2) context, (3) repetition, (4) sign,
(5) association, (6) likeness, (7) association of the possessor
and the possessed or master and servant, or things which
are generally seen to follow each other, (8) separation (as of
husband and wife), (9) simpler employment, (10) opposition,
(11) excess, (12) that from which anything can be got, (13) cover
and covered, (14) pleasure and pain causing memory of that
which caused them, (15) fear, (16) entreaty, (17) action such
as that of the chariot reminding the charioteer, (18) affection,
(19) merit and demerit [Footnote ref 1]. It is said that knowledge does
not belong to body, and then the question of the production of the body
as due to ad@r@s@ta is described. Salvation (_apavarga_) is effected by
the manas being permanently separated from the soul (atman)
through the destruction of karma.

In the fourth book in course of the examination of do@sa
(defects), it is said that moha (ignorance), is at the root of all
other defects such as raga (attachment) and dve@sa (antipathy).
As against the Buddhist view that a thing could be produced by
destruction, it is said that destruction is only a stage in the
process of origination. Is'vara is regarded as the cause of the
production of effects of deeds performed by men's efforts, for
man is not always found to attain success according to his efforts.
A reference is made to the doctrine of those who say that all
things have come into being by no-cause (_animitta_), for then
no-cause would be the cause, which is impossible.

The doctrine of some that all things are eternal is next refuted
on the ground that we always see things produced and destroyed.

__________________________________________________________________

[Footnote 1: _Nyaya sutra_ III. ii. 44.]

301

The doctrine of the nihilistic Buddhists (s'unyavadin Bauddhas)
that all things are what they are by virtue of their relations to
other things, and that of other Buddhists who hold that there are
merely the qualities and parts but no substances or wholes, are
then refuted. The fruits of karmas are regarded as being like
the fruits of trees which take some time before they can ripen.
Even though there may be pleasures here and there, birth means
sorrow for men, for even the man who enjoys pleasure is tormented
by many sorrows, and sometimes one mistakes pains for
pleasures. As there is no sorrow in the man who is in deep dreamless
sleep, so there is no affliction (_kles'a_) in the man who attains
apavarga (salvation) [Footnote ref 1]. When once this state is attained all
efforts (_prav@rtti_) cease for ever, for though efforts were beginningless
with us they were all due to attachment, antipathy, etc. Then
there are short discussions regarding the way in which egoism
(_aha@mkara_) ceases with the knowledge of the true causes of defects
(_do@sa_); about the nature of whole and parts and about the
nature of atoms (_a@nus_) which cannot further be divided. A discussion
is then introduced against the doctrine of the Vijnanavadins
that nothing can be regarded as having any reality when
separated from thoughts. Incidentally Yoga is mentioned as
leading to right knowledge.

The whole of the fifth book which seems to be a later addition
is devoted to the enumeration of different kinds of refutations
(_nigrahasthana_) and futilities (_jati_).



Caraka, Nyaya sutras and Vais'e@sika sutras.

When we compare the _Nyaya sutras_ with the _Vais'e@sika sutras_
we find that in the former two or three differentstreams of purposes
have met, whereas the latter is much more homogeneous. The large
amount of materials relating to debates treated as a practical art
for defeating an opponent would lead one to suppose that it was
probably originally compiled from some other existing treatises
which were used by Hindus and Buddhists alike for rendering
themselves fit to hold their own in debates with their
opponents [Footnote ref 2]. This assumption is justified when

____________________________________________________________________

[Footnote 1: Vatsyayana notes that this is the salvation of him who has
known Brahman, IV. i. 63.]

[Footnote 2: A reference to the _Suvar@naprabhasa sutra_ shows that the
Buddhist missionaries used to get certain preparations for improving
their voice in order to be able to argue with force, and they took to
the worship of Sarasvati (goddess of learning), who they supposed would
help them in bringing readily before their mind all the information
and ideas of which they stood so much in need at the time of debates.]

302

we compare the futilities (jati) quibbles (chala), etc., relating to
disputations as found in the _Nyaya sutra_ with those that are
found in the medical work of Caraka (78 A.D.), III. viii. There
are no other works in early Sanskrit literature, excepting the
_Nyaya sutra_ and _Caraka-sa@mhita_ which have treated of these
matters. Caraka's description of some of the categories (e.g.
d@r@s@tanta, prayojana, pratijna and vita@n@da) follows very closely
the definitions given of those in the _Nyaya sutras_. There are
others such as the definitions of jalpa, chala, nigrahasthana, etc.,
where the definitions of two authorities differ more. There are
some other logical categories mentioned in Caraka (e.g. _prati@s@thapana,
jijnasa, vyavasaya, vakyado@sa, vakyapras'a@msa, upalambha,
parihara, abhyanujna_, etc.) which are not found in the
_Nyaya sutra_ [Footnote ref 1]. Again, the various types of futilities
(jati) and points of opponent's refutation (nigrahasthana) mentioned in
the _Nyaya sutra_ are not found in _Caraka_. There are some terms which
are found in slightly variant forms in the two works, e.g. _aupamya_ in
_Caraka, upamana_ in _Nyaya sutra, arthapatti_ in _Nyaya sutra_ and
_arthaprapti_ in _Caraka_. Caraka does not seem to know anything
about the Nyaya work on this subject, and it is plain that the
treatment of these terms of disputations in the _Caraka_ is much
simpler and less technical than what we find in the _Nyaya sutras_.
If we leave out the varieties of jati and nigrahasthana of the
fifth book, there is on the whole a great agreement between the
treatment of Caraka and that of the _Nyaya sutras_. It seems therefore
in a high degree probable that both Caraka and the _Nyaya
sutras_ were indebted for their treatment of these terms of disputation
to some other earlier work. Of these, Caraka's compilation
was earlier, whereas the compilation of the _Nyaya sutras_ represents
a later work when a hotter atmosphere of disputations had
necessitated the use of more technical terms which are embodied
in this work, but which were not contained in the earlier work.
It does not seem therefore that this part of the work could have
been earlier than the second century A.D. Another stream flowing
through the _Nyaya sutras_ is that of a polemic against the doctrines
which could be attributed to the Sautrantika Buddhists, the
Vijnanavada Buddhists, the nihilists, the Sa@mkhya, the Carvaka,
and some other unknown schools of thought to which we find no

further allusion elsewhere. The _Vais'e@sika sutras_ as we have already
seen had argued only against the Mima@msa, and ultimately agreed
with them on most points. The dispute with Mima@msa in the
_Nyaya sutras_ is the same as in the Vais'e@sika over the question
of the doctrine of the eternality of sound. The question of the
self-validity of knowledge (_svata@h prama@nyavada_)and the akhyati
doctrine of illusion of the Mima@msists, which form the two chief
points of discussion between later Mima@msa and later Nyaya,
are never alluded to in the _Nyaya sutras_. The advocacy of Yoga
methods (_Nyaya sutras_, IV.ii.38-42 and 46) seems also to be
an alien element; these are not found in Vais'e@sika and are not in
keeping with the general tendency of the _Nyaya sutras_, and the
Japanese tradition that Mirok added them later on as Mahamahopadhyaya
Haraprasada S'astri has pointed out [Footnote ref l] is not improbable.

The _Vais'e@sika sutras_, III.i.18 and III.ii.1, describe perceptional
knowledge as produced by the close proximity of the
self (atman), the senses and the objects of sense, and they
also adhere to the doctrine, that colour can only be perceived
under special conditions of sa@mskara (conglomeration etc.).
The reason for inferring the existence of manas from the non-simultaneity
(_ayaugapadya_) of knowledge and efforts is almost
the same with Vais'e@sika as with Nyaya. The _Nyaya sutras_
give a more technical definition of perception, but do not bring
in the questions of sa@mskara or udbhutarupavattva which Vais'e@sika
does. On the question of inference Nyaya gives three
classifications as purvavat, s'e@savat and samanyatod@r@s@ta, but no
definition. The _Vais'e@sika sutras_ do not know of these classifications,
and give only particular types or instances of inference
(V.S. III. i. 7-17, IX. ii. 1-2, 4-5). Inference is said to be made
when a thing is in contact with another, or when it is in a relation
of inherence in it, or when it inheres in a third thing; one kind
of effect may lead to the inference of another kind of effect, and
so on. These are but mere collections of specific instances of inference
without reaching a general theory. The doctrine of vyapti
(concomitance of _hetu_ (reason) and _sadhya_ (probandum)) which became
so important in later Nyaya has never been properly formulated
either in the _Nyaya sutras_ or in the Vais'e@sika. _Vais'e@sika
sutra_, III. i. 24, no doubt assumes the knowledge of concomitance
between hetu and sadhya (_prasiddhipurvakatvat apades'asya_),

but the technical vyapti is not known, and the connotation of
the term _prasiddhipurvakatva_ of Vais'e@sika seems to be more
loose than the term _vyapti_ as we know it in the later Nyaya. The
_Vais'e@sika sutras_ do not count scriptures (_s'abda_) as a separate
prama@na, but they tacitly admit the great validity of the Vedas.
With _Nyaya sutras_ s'abda as a prama@na applies not only to the
Vedas, but to the testimony of any trustworthy person, and
Vatsyayana says that trustworthy persons may be of three
kinds _@r@si, arya_ and _mleccha_ (foreigners). Upamana which is
regarded as a means of right cognition in Nyaya is not even
referred to in the _Vais'e@sika sutras_. The _Nyaya sutras_ know of
other prama@nas, such as _arthapatti, sambhava_ and _aitihya_, but
include them within the prama@nas admitted by them, but the
_Vais'e@sika sutras_ do not seem to know them at all [Footnote ref 1]. The
_Vais'e@sika sutras_ believe in the perception of negation (abhava) through
the perception of the locus to which such negation refers (IX. i.
1-10). The _Nyaya sutras_ (II. ii. 1, 2, 7-12) consider that abhava as
non-existence or negation can be perceived; when one asks another
to "bring the clothes which are not marked," he finds that marks
are absent in some clothes and brings them; so it is argued that
absence or non-existence can be directly perceived [Footnote ref 2]. Though
there is thus an agreement between the Nyaya and the _Vais'e@sika
sutras_ about the acceptance of abhava as being due to perception,
yet their method of handling the matter is different. The _Nyaya
sutras_ say nothing about the categories of _dravya, gu@na, karma,
vis'e@sa_ and _samavaya_ which form the main subjects of Vais'e@ska
discussions [Footnote ref 3]. The _Nyaya sutras_ take much pains to prove
the materiality of the senses. But this question does not seem to have
been important with Vais'e@sika. The slight reference to this
question in VIII. ii. 5-6 can hardly be regarded as sufficient.
The _Vais'e@sika sutras_ do not mention the name of "Is'vara," whereas
the _Nyaya sutras_ try to prove his existence on eschatological
grounds. The reasons given in support of the existence of self
in the _Nyaya sutras_ are mainly on the ground of the unity of
sense-cognitions and the phenomenon of recognition, whereas the

Vaisesika lays its main emphasis on self-consciousness as a fact
of knowledge. Both the Nyaya and the _Vais'e@sika sutras_ admit
the existence of atoms, but all the details of the doctrine of
atomic structure in later Nyaya-Vais'e@sika are absent there. The
Vai'se@sika calls salvation _ni@hs'reyasa_ or _mok@sa_ and the Nyaya
_apavarga_. Mok@sa with Vais'e@sika is the permanent cessation of
connection with body; the apavarga with Nyaya is cessation of
pain [Footnote ref l]. In later times the main points of difference between
the Vais'e@sika and Nyaya are said to lie with regard to theory of the
notion of number, changes of colour in the molecules by heat, etc.
Thus the former admitted a special procedure of the mind by which
cognitions of number arose in the mind (e.g. at the first moment
there is the sense contact with an object, then the notion of oneness,
then from a sense of relativeness--apek@sabuddhi--notion
of two, then a notion of two-ness, and then the notion of two
things); again, the doctrine of pilupaka (changes of qualities by
heat are produced in atoms and not in molecules as Nyaya held)
was held by Vais'e@sika, which the Naiyayikas did not admit [Footnote ref
2]. But as the _Nyaya sutras_ are silent on these points, it is not
possible to say that such were really the differences between early
Nyaya and early Vaise@sika. These differences may be said to hold between
the later interpreters of Vais'e@sika and the later interpreters of
Nyaya. The Vais'e@sika as we find it in the commentary of
Pras'astapada (probably sixth century A.D.), and the Nyaya from
the time of Udyotakara have come to be treated as almost
the same system with slight variations only. I have therefore
preferred to treat them together. The main presentation of the
Nyaya-Vais'e@sika philosophy in this chapter is that which is found
from the sixth century onwards.


The Vais'e@sika and Nyaya Literature.

It is difficult to ascertain definitely the date of the _Vais'e@sika
sutras_ by Ka@nada, also called Aulukya the son of Uluka, though
there is every reason to suppose it to be pre-Buddhistic. It

_Sa@mk@sepas'a@nkarajaya_, XVI. 68-69 in _J.A.S.B._, 1905, and another
passage from a Nyaya writer Bhasarvajna, pp. 39-41, in _J.A.S.B._, 1914,
to show that the old Naiyayikas considered that there was an element
of happiness (_sukha_) in the state of mukti (salvation) which the
Vais'e@sikas denied. No evidence in support of this opinion is found
in the Nyaya or the _Vais'e@sika sutras_, unless the cessation of pain
with Nyaya is interpreted as meaning the resence of some sort of bliss
or happiness.]

appears from the _Vayu purana_ that he was born in Prabhasa near
Dvaraka, and was the disciple of Somas'arma. The time of
Pras'astapada who wrote a bha@sya (commentary) of the _Vais'e@sika
sutras_ cannot also unfortunately be ascertained. The peculiarity
of Pras'astapada's bha@sya is this that unlike other bha@syas
(which first give brief explanations of the text of the sutras and
then continue to elaborate independent explanations by explaining
the first brief comments), it does not follow the sutras but
is an independent dissertation based on their main contents [Footnote
ref 1]. There were two other bha@syas on the _Vais'e@sika sutras_,
namely _Rava@na-bha@sya_ and _Bharadvaja-v@rtti_, but these are now
probably lost. References to the former are found in
_Kira@navalibhaskara_ of Padmanabha Mis'ra and also in _Ratnaprabha_
2. 2. II. Four commentaries were written on this bha@sya, namely
_Vyomavati_ by Vyomas'ekharacarya, _Nyayakandali_ by S'ridhara,
_Kira@navali_ by Udayana (984 A.D.) and _Lilavati_ S'rivatsacarya.
In addition to these Jagadis'a Bha@t@tacarya of Navadvipa and S'a@nkara
Mis'ra wrote two other commentaries on the _Pras'astapada-bhasya_,
namely _Bhasyasukti_ and _Ka@nada-rahasya_. S'a@nkara Mis'ra (1425
A.D.) also wrote a commentary on the _Vais'e@sika sutras_ called the
_Upaskara_. Of these _Nyaya-kandali_ of S'ridhara on account of its
simplicity of style and elaborate nature of exposition is probably
the best for a modern student of Vais'e@sika. Its author was a
native of the village of Bhuris@r@s@ti in Bengal (Ra@dha). His father's
name was Baladeva and mother's name was Acchoka and he
wrote his work in 913 S'aka era (990 A.D.) as he himself writes
at the end of his work.

The _Nyaya sutra_ was written by Ak@sapada or Gautama, and
the earliest commentary on it written by Vatsyayana is known
as the _Vatsyayana-bha@sya_. The date of Vatsyayana has not

[Footnote 1: The bha@sya of Pras'astapada can hardly he called a
bha@sya (elaborate commentary). He himself makes no such claim and
calls his work a compendium of the properties of the categories
(_Padarthadharmasa@mgraha_). He takes the categories of _dravya,
gu@na, karma, samanya, vis'e@sa_ and _samavaya_ in order and without
raising any discussions plainly narrates what he has got to say on
them. Some of the doctrines which are important in later
Nyaya-Vais'e@sika discussions, such as the doctrine of creation and
dissolution, doctrine of number, the theory that the number of atoms
contributes to the atomic measure of the molecules, the doctrine of
pilupaka in connection with the transformation of colours by heat
occur in his narration for the first time as the _Vais'e@sika sutras_
are silent on these points. It is difficult to ascertain his date
definitely; he is the earliest writer on Vais'e@sika available to us
after Ka@nada and it is not improbable that he lived in the 5th or 6th
century A.D.]

been definitely settled, but there is reason to believe that he
lived some time in the beginning of the fourth century A.D. Jacobi
places him in 300 A.D. Udyotakara (about 635 A.D.) wrote a
_Varttika_ on Vatsyayana's bha@sya to establish the Nyaya views
and to refute the criticisms of the Buddhist logician Di@nnaga
(about 500 A.D.) in his _Prama@nasamuccaya_. Vacaspatimis'ra
(840 A.D.) wrote a sub-commentary on the _Nyayavarttika_ of
Udyotakara called _Nyayavarttikatatparya@tika_ in order to make
clear the right meanings of Udyotakara's _Varttika_ which was sinking
in the mud as it were through numerous other bad writings
(_dustarakunibandhapa@nkamagnanam_). Udayana (984 A.D.) wrote
a sub-commentary on the _Tatparya@tika_ called
_Tatparya@tikaparis'uddhi_. Varddhamana (1225 A.D.) wrote a
sub-commentary on that called the _Nyayanibandhaprakas'a_. Padmanabha
wrote a sub-commentary on that called _Varddhamanendu_ and S'a@nkara
Mis'ra (1425 A.D.) wrote a sub-commentary on that called the
_Nyayatatparyama@n@dana_. In the seventeenth century Vis'vanatha
wrote an independent short commentary known as _Vis'vanathav@rtti_,
on the _Nyaya sutra_, and Radhamohana wrote a separate
commentary on the _Nyaya sutras_ known as _Nyayasutravivara@na_.
In addition to these works on the _Nyaya sutras_ many other
independent works of great philosophical value have been written
on the Nyaya system. The most important of these in medieval
times is the _Nyayamanjari_ of Jayanta (880 A.D.), who flourished
shortly after Vacaspatimis'ra. Jayanta chooses some of the _Nyaya
sutras_ for interpretation, but he discusses the Nyaya views quite
independently, and criticizes the views of other systems of Indian
thought of his time. It is far more comprehensive than Vacaspati's
_Tatparya@tika_, and its style is most delightfully lucid. Another
important work is Udayana's _Kusumanjali_ in which he tries to
prove the existence of Is'vara (God). This work ought to be read
with its commentary _Prakas'a_ by Varddhamana (1225 A.D.) and its
sub-commentary _Makaranda_ by Rucidatta (1275 A.D.). Udayana's
_Atmatattvaviveka_ is a polemical work against the Buddhists, in
which he tries to establish the Nyaya doctrine of soul. In addition
to these we have a number of useful works on Nyaya in later
times. Of these the following deserve special mention in connection
with the present work. _Bha@sapariccheda_ by Vis'vanatha with
its commentaries _Muktavali, Dinakari_ and _Ramarudri, Tarkasamgraha_
with _Nyayanir@naya, Tarkabka@sa_ of Kes'ava Mis'ra with

308

the commentary _Nyayapradipa, Saptapadarthi_ of S'ivaditya,
_Tarkikarak@sa_ of Varadaraja with the commentary _Ni@ska@n@taka_
of Mallinatha, _Nyayasara_ of Madhava Deva of the city of Dhara and
_Nyayasiddhantamanjari_ of Janakinatha Bha@t@tacarya with the
_Nyayamanjarisara_ by Yadavacarya, and _Nyayasiddhantadipa_ of
S'a@sadhara with _Prabha_ by S'e@sanantacarya.

The new school of Nyaya philosophy known as Navya-Nyaya
began with Ga@nges'a Upadhyaya of Mithila, about
1200 A.D. Ga@nges'a wrote only on the four prama@nas admitted by the
Nyaya, viz. pratyak@sa, anumana, upamana, and s'abda, and not on any of
the topics of Nyaya metaphysics. But it so happened that his
discussions on anumana (inference) attracted unusually great attention
in Navadvipa (Bengal), and large numbers of commentaries and
commentaries of commentaries were written on the anumana
portion of his work _Tattvacintama@ni, and many independent
treatises on sabda and anumana were also written by the scholars
of Bengal, which became thenceforth for some centuries the home
of Nyaya studies. The commentaries of Raghunatha S'iroma@ni
(1500 A.D.), Mathura Bha@t@tacarya (1580 A.D.), Gadadhara Bha@t@tacarya
(1650 A.D.) and Jagadisa Bha@t@tacarya (1590 A.D.), commentaries
on S'iroma@ni's commentary on _Tattvacintamani, had been
very widely read in Bengal. The new school of Nyaya became the
most important study in Navadvipa and there appeared a series
of thinkers who produced an extensive literature on the subject
[Footnote ref l].The contribution was not in the direction of
metaphysics, theology, ethics, or religion, but consisted mainly
in developing a system of linguistic notations to specify accurately
and precisely any concept or its relation with other concepts [Footnote
ref 2]. Thus for example when they wished to define precisely the
nature of the concomitance of one concept with another (e.g. smoke
and fire), they would so specify the relation that the exact nature
of the concomitance should be clearly expressed, and that there
should be no confusion or ambiguity. Close subtle analytic
thinking and the development of a system of highly technical
