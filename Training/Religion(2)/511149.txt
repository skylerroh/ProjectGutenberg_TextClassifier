  Lord Jesus Christ, to us attend.
  Thy Holy Spirit to us send. Amen.


83.

  Lord, teach us how to keep Thy day
  And lead and bless us all the way. Amen.


84.

  Lord, open Thou my heart to hear
  And by Thy Word to me draw near;
  Let me Thy Word still pure retain,
  Let me Thy child and heir remain. Amen.


85.

  Direct me now, O gracious Lord,
  To hear aright Thy holy Word;
  Assist Thy minister to preach,
  And let Thy Holy Spirit teach,
  And let eternal life be found
  By all who hear the joyful sound. Amen.


86.

  On what has now been sown
  Thy blessing, Lord, bestow;
  The power is Thine alone
  To make it spring and grow. Amen.


87.

Blessed Lord, let Thy blessing go with me to-day and grant that I may be
obedient to my teachers and may learn with pleasure whatever I am
taught, to Thy great honor and glory. Amen.


88.

O most gracious God, let me never forget the many good things that I
have heard this day; but let them abide in my heart, so that I may amend
my life, that I may be able to give a good account of them to Jesus
Christ, our Lord and Savior, when He comes to judge the world at the
Last Day, for whose sake I ask all blessings, and to whom be glory
forever and ever! Amen.


89.

  Almighty God, Thy Word is cast
  Like seed into the ground;
  Now let the dew of heaven descend
  And righteous fruits abound. Amen.


90.

  May the grace of Christ, our Savior,
  And the Father's boundless love,
  With the Holy Spirit's favor,
  Rest upon us from above.

  Thus may we abide in union
  With each other and the Lord
  And possess, in sweet communion,
  Joys which earth cannot afford. Amen.


91.

  O give me Samuel's ear,
  The open ear, O Lord,
  Alive and quick to hear
  Each whisper of Thy Word,
  Like him to answer at Thy call,
  And to obey Thee first of all. Amen.


92.

  Abide, O dear Redeemer,
  Among us with Thy Word
  And thus now and hereafter
  True peace and joy afford. Amen.


93.

  Now our worship sweet is o'er--
  Singing, praying, teaching, hearing:
  Let us gladly God adore
  For His gracious strength and cheering.
  Blest His name, who fain would save us,
  For the rich repast He gave us.

  Let our going out be blest,
  Bless our entrance in like measure;
  Bless, O Lord, our toil and rest,
  Bless our bread, our grief and pleasure;
  Be in death Thy blessing given,
  And make us blest heirs of heaven.
  Amen.


94.

  My God, accept my heart this day
  And make it always Thine,
  That I from Thee no more may stray,
  No more from Thee decline.

  Anoint me with Thy heavenly grace,
  Adopt me for Thine own,
  That I may see Thy glorious face
  And worship at Thy throne.

  Let every thought and work and word
  To Thee be ever given;
  Then life shall be Thy service, Lord,
  And death the gate of heaven. Amen.


95.

  Dismiss us with Thy blessing, Lord;
  Help us to feed upon Thy Word;
  All that has been amiss forgive
  And let Thy truth within us live. Amen.




Christmas.


96.

  Let us all with gladsome voice
  Praise the God of heaven,
  Who, to bid our hearts rejoice,
  His own Son hath given. Amen.


97.

  O Lord Christ, our Savior dear,
  Be Thou ever near us;
  Grant us now a glad New Year.
  Amen, Jesus, hear us! Amen.


98.
