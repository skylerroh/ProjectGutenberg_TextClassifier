
                                   II

    O Lord of mercy, by whose grace
    The sinner seeks the Father's face,
        And finds a welcome there;
    When fears the trembling soul distress,
    And sins the aching heart oppress,
        O Lord of mercy, spare.

                                   III

    And say to Him who loves Thee best,
    And sent Thee to a world distressed,
        His blessing to impart,--
    "Hear Thou the sinner's mournful cries,
    Accept his preferred sacrifice,
        A broken, contrite heart."

                                   IV

    Blest Spirit, who in holy flame,
    At Pentecost all powerful came,--
        Our sin-stained souls renew;
    And by Thine all-consuming fire,
    Consume our sin and vile desire,
        And make us pure and true.

                                    V

    To God who dwells in highest heaven,
    Be endless praise and glory given,--
        And praise to Christ the Son.
    And to the Holy Spirit blest,
    For comfort and for gifts the best,--
        Immortal Three in One.




                                    I

    By Thine own hand the gift was given
    Of wealth, and hope of highest heaven;
    But, fool at heart, Thy grace was spurned,
    And from my Father's house I turned.

                                   II

    O, hear my plaint, I cry to Thee;
    Be pitiful, and pardon me,
    For I have sinned; O, give me grace
    To seek in penitence Thy face.

                                   III

    Yea, I repent in anguish low;
    Give me again Thy love to know;
    And if a servant's place remain,
    Take me in mercy back again.




                                    I

    Lord, Thou art good and kind,
      And full of tender grace;
    Now make Thy countenance to shine,
      And let me see Thy face.

                                   II

    For O, my heart is sad,
      Because my sin I know;
    And though I strive, I fail,
      And still ungodly grow.

                                   III

    And all my aims are lost,
      And all my striving vain,--
    Wilt Thou refresh my soul,
      And visit me again?

                                   IV

    'Tis morning when the sun
      Upon the mountain glows;
    'Tis evening when the shade
      Upon the valleys grows;

                                    V

    And when Thy face I see,
      'Tis morning in my soul;
    But when Thou turn'st away,
      The evening shadows roll.

                                   VI

    And night comes on apace,
      And all forlorn I sigh;--
    O, bid the morning dawn,
      Look on me lest I die.

                                   VII

    O, Thou art good and kind,
      And full of tender grace;
    Now make Thy countenance to shine,
      And let me see Thy face.




                                    I

    O Lord of Life, when mortals call,
    And freedom seek from earthly thrall,
    Hear Thou in heaven and save us all,
                  In mercy, Lord.

                                   II

    O Full of Mercy, when we groan,
    Because of sin our spirits own,
    Hear, who for sinners didst atone,
                  In mercy, Lord.

                                   III

    O Full of Pity, when we bear
    To Thy blest feet our cankering care,
    Take of our weary load a share,
                  In mercy, Lord.

                                   IV

    O Full of Grace! when sufferers tell
    The grief Thou knowest, Lord, so well,
    Come, with the broken-hearted dwell,
                  In mercy, Lord.

                                    V

    When, lured by hope, our spirits rise
    To where Thou beckonest from the skies;
    Then, be eternal life the prize,
                  In mercy, Lord.




                                    I

    I wandered sore distressed,
      All weary and forlorn;
    I had no place to rest,
      Of all my pleasures shorn,--
    My thirsting spirit sighed,
    And in the desert cried.

                                   II

    The Shepherd heard my cry,
      Who came His flock to find,
    And drew in mercy nigh,
      For He is wondrous kind;
    His winning voice awoke
    My spirit as He spoke.

                                   III

    He bade my wandering cease,
      And gave my heart a home,
    That, from the bliss of peace,
      I might no longer roam;--
    He gave me hope for fears,
    And lasting joy for tears.




                                    I

    God sent me to the desert wild,
      Where all is parched with endless drought,
    For I had grown a wayward child,
      And now my sin had found me out;--
    He sent me to the desert drear,
    And, ah! my soul was charged with fear.

                                   II

    I wandered where the brooks were dry,
      While memory wove a dismal song,
    And to my God I raised my cry,
      And sang my dirge the whole day long;--
    For I was in the desert drear,
    And, ah! my soul was charged with fear.

                                   III

    The God of grace His comfort sent,
      And soon the desert blossomed fair,
    While round my path, where'er I went,
      Sweet flowers poured forth their odours rare;--
    He sent me to a desert drear,
    Now flowers and luscious fruits appear.

                                   IV

    O God, when by the path of sin,
      We reach the land where famine reigns;
    And dread possesses all within,
      And all around are woes and pains;--
    Then make the world a desert rare,
    Of joys upspringing everywhere.
