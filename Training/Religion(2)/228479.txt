
                                   III

    Now bright their silver light appears,
      And reverent eyes behold the sight;
    Hope lights the darkness of our fears--
          The stars shine bright.

                                   IV

    When on our life the curtain falls,
      And fast descends a threatening night,
    Then, lest dismay the soul appals,
          The stars shine bright.

                                    V

    O great the wisdom, great the power,--
      God draws the curtains of the night,
    And, in the dark and lonesome hour,
          The stars shine bright.

                                   VI

    The glory and the truth of God,
      His lovingkindness and His care,--
    Such is the light He sheds abroad,
          His stars shine rare.




                                    I

    A crown of gold surpassing rare,
    The western hills, in beauty, wear;
    And earth and sea reflect the light,
    That fades before th' approach of night.

                                   II

    O Glorious Sun! whose peerless ray
    Illumes the realm of endless day,
    Shine on a world where darkness dwells,
    And all the joy of day dispels.

                                   III

    Soft o'er the land the twilight creeps;
    Night falls apace, and nature sleeps;
    O let not night my life control,
    And plunge in sleep my drowsy soul.

                                   IV

    Sleep to the weary pilgrim give,
    But let the soul through slumber live;
    Wake when the first faint gleam of morn
    Tells that another day is born.

                                    V

    Light of my life! bid night depart,
    Sing to my soul, and cheer my heart;
    That morn, and noon, and night may be
    One beauteous day of joy to me.

                                   VI

    And when the brightest morn shall break,
    And bid the eternal day awake,
    O Glorious Sun! in radiance shine,
    To guard from night the realm divine.

    The Lord of Life to earth came down,--
      Come, gaily sound His praises high;
    O 'twas a day of high renown,
      While angels praise Him in the sky.

    The shepherds saw a wondrous sight,
        In Bethlehem's fields at even,

    Shed o'er the plains its glorious light,
    And angel bands, harmonious quite,
        His praises sang from heaven.

                                   II

    Say, came He forth by myriads led?--
      Come, gaily sound his praises high;
    A crown of gold upon his head?
      While angels praise Him in the sky.
                  _Refrain._

                                   III

    Of earthly pomp the Lord had none,--
      Come, gaily sound His praises high;
    His kingly crown had not been won,
      While angels praise Him in the sky.
                  _Refrain._

                                   IV

    A little child the Lord became,--
      Come, gaily sound His praises high,
    To bear our guilt, and share our shame,
      While angels praise Him in the sky.
                  _Refrain._

                                    V

    O Jesu, Who in manger lay,--
      Come, gaily sound his praises high,
    Make me a little child to-day,
      While angels praise Thee in the sky.
                  _Refrain._

                                   VI

    And may I come, with spirit meet,--
      Come, gaily sound His praises high,
    To lay my tribute at Thy feet,
      While angels praise Thee in the sky.
                  _Refrain._

                                   VII

    To Father, Spirit, One with Christ,--
      Come, gaily sound His praises high,
    Be endless praise, Whose love sufficed,
      While angels praise Him in the sky.
                  _Refrain._

                                    I

    Jerusalem, rejoice!
      Keep festival and sing;
    All ye who dwell in Zion's courts,
      Bring forth an offering.
            Rejoice, rejoice,
            Jerusalem, rejoice;
        And sing with glee, right merrily,
            Let every heart and voice.

                                   II

    To-day the chain is loosed
      That long hath bound our race,
    The condemnation is removed
      Through God's abounding grace.
            Rejoice, rejoice, etc.

                                   III

    The gates of heaven are wide,
      And Satan's work undone;
    For She[3] who fell beneath his power,
      Now gives the world God's Son.
            Rejoice, rejoice, etc.

                                   IV

    O depth of riches great!
      O height of wisdom strong!
    O knowledge of the Living God,
      To right such grievous wrong!
            Rejoice, rejoice, etc.

                                    V

    Now, let creation sing
      And leap, nor brook control,
    For Christ hath come to call it back,
      And save each ruined soul.
            Rejoice, rejoice,
            Jerusalem rejoice;
        And sing with glee, right merrily,
            Let every heart and voice.

    The best that heaven could bring--
      First fruits, an offering free--
    Was brought from far, when, by the star,
      The wise men came to Thee.

                                   II

    No sceptre, and no throne!
      The magi were amazed,
    As, with surprise, on humble guise
      And poverty, they gazed.

                                   III

    But there Thy God-head shone,
      Despite the manger bed;
    O Christ, the Lord, Incarnate Word!
      'Twas there Thou laid'st Thy head.




                                    I

    Out from the rising of the sun,
      O'er tracts of desert wild,
    The Magi came on journey lone,
      To seek the heaven-born child;
    The star o'erhead their footsteps led,
      And hope their way beguiled.

                                   II

    They bore Him costly gifts of gold,
      And myrrh and spices sweet:
    "For He is King," they had been told,
      Whom they would meekly greet;
    And they would go, in reverence low,
      And worship at His feet.

                                   III

    O humble Child, in manger laid!
      The wise beheld Thee there,
    And reverently their homage paid,
      And gave their offerings rare.
    Their quest was found, and to the ground
      They bowed the head in prayer.

                                   IV

    O Jesu, who in manger lay,
      The Son of God most high,
    Let me my humble homage pay,
      And bring my offerings nigh,
    And humbly greet Thee at Thy feet,
      And low in worship lie.
