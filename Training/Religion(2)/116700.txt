Remarkable that spurious works are often found in more than one
    edition,                                                           411


CHAPTER III.

THE IGNATIAN EPISTLES AND THEIR CLAIMS--THE INTERNAL EVIDENCE.

The history of these Epistles like the story of the Sibylline books,   413
The three Curetonian Letters as objectionable as those formerly
    published,                                                         414

The Word of God strangely ignored in these letters,                    ib.
Their chronological blunders betray their forgery,                     417
Various words in them have a meaning which they did not acquire
    until after the time of Ignatius,                                  419
Their puerilities, vapouring, and mysticism betray their
    spuriousness,                                                      422
The anxiety for martyrdom displayed in them attests their forgery,     423
The internal evidence confirms the view already taken of the date
    of their fabrication,                                              425
Strange attachment of Episcopalians to these letters,                  426

CHAPTER V.

THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH IN THE SECOND CENTURY.

Statement of Justin Martyr,                                            499
Great obscurity resting on the subject,                                500
Illustrated by the Epistles of Clement and Polycarp,                   ib.
Circumstances which led to the writing of Clement's Epistle,           501
Churches of Corinth and Borne then governed by presbyters,             503
Churches of Smyrna and Philippi governed by presbyters,                504
The presbyters had a chairman or president,                            ib.

Argument against heretics from the episcopal succession illustrated,   513
The claims of seniority long respected in various ways,                515

Change of the law of seniority,                                        518
Change made about the end of the second century,                       ib.
Singular that many episcopal lists stop at the end of the second
    century,                                                           519

CHAPTER VII.

PRELACY BEGINS IN ROME.

Comparative length of the lives of the early bishops of Rome,          537
Observations relative to a change in the organization of the
    Roman Church in the time of Hyginus,                               538
  1. The statement of Hilary will account for the increased average
      in the length of episcopal life,                                 539
  2. The testimony of Jerome cannot otherwise be explained,            540
  3. Hilary indicates that the constitution of the Church was
      changed about this period,                                       541
  4. At this time such an arrangement must naturally have suggested
      itself to the Roman Christians,                                  542
  5. The violent death of Telesphorus fitted to prepare the way
      for it,                                                          543
  6. The influence of Rome would recommend its adoption,               544
  7. A vacancy which occurred after the death of Hyginus accords
      with this view. Valentine a candidate for the Roman bishopric,   545
  8. The letters of Pius to Justus corroborate this view,              547
  9. It is sustained by the fact that the word _bishop_ now
      began to be applied to the presiding elder,                      550
 10. The Pontifical Book remarkably confirms it--Not strange that
      history speaks so little of this change,                         552
Little alteration at first apparent in the general aspect of the
    Church in consequence of the adoption of the new principle,        554
Facility with which the change could be accomplished,                  565
Polycarp probably dissatisfied with the new arrangements,              556
Change, in all likelihood, not much opposed,                           558
Many presbyters, as well as the people, would be favourable to it,     ib.
The new system gradually spread,                                       559


CHAPTER VIII.

Why the Apostle Peter everywhere so highly exalted,                    570

CHAPTER IX.

PRIMITIVE EPISCOPACY AND PRESBYTERIAN ORDINATION.

Where Christians formed only a single congregation Episcopacy
    made little change,                                                575
The bishop the parish minister,                                        ib.
Every one who could might preach if the bishops permitted,             576
Bishops thickly planted--all of equal rank--the greatest had very
    limited jurisdiction,                                              577

     HISTORY OF THE PLANTING AND GROWTH OF THE APOSTOLIC CHURCH.



CHAPTER I.

THE ROMAN EMPIRE AT THE TIME OF THE BIRTH OF CHRIST.


Upwards of a quarter of a century before the Birth of Christ, the
grandnephew of Julius Caesar had become sole master of the Roman world.
Never, perhaps, at any former period, had so many human beings
acknowledged the authority of a single potentate. Some of the most
powerful monarchies at present in Europe extend over only a fraction of
the territory which Augustus governed: the Atlantic on the west, the
Euphrates on the east, the Danube and the Rhine on the north, and the
deserts of Africa on the south, were the boundaries of his empire.

We do not adequately estimate the rank of Augustus among contemporary
sovereigns, when we consider merely the superficial extent of the
countries placed within the range of his jurisdiction. His subjects
probably formed more than one-third of the entire population of the
globe, and amounted to about one hundred millions of souls.[Endnote 3:1]
His empire embraced within its immense circumference the best cultivated
and the most civilised portions of the earth. The remains of its
populous cities, its great fortresses, its extensive aqueducts, and its
stately temples, may still be pointed out as the memorials of its
grandeur. The capital was connected with the most distant provinces by
carefully constructed roads, along which the legions could march with
ease and promptitude, either to quell an internal insurrection, or to
encounter an invading enemy. And the military resources at the command
of Augustus were abundantly sufficient to maintain obedience among the
myriads whom he governed. After the victory of Actium he was at the head
of upwards of forty veteran legions; and though some of these had been
decimated by war, yet, when recruited, and furnished with their full
complement of auxiliaries, they constituted a force of little less than
half a million of soldiers.

The arts of peace now nourished under the sunshine of imperial
patronage. Augustus could boast, towards the end of his reign, that he
had converted Rome from a city of brick huts into a city of marble
palaces. The wealth of the nobility was enormous; and, excited by the
example of the Emperor and his friend Agrippa, they erected and
decorated mansions in a style of regal magnificence. The taste cherished
in the capital was soon widely diffused; and, in a comparatively short
period, many new and gorgeous temples and cities appeared throughout the
empire. Herod the Great expended vast sums on architectural
improvements. The Temple of Jerusalem, rebuilt under his administration,
was one of the wonders of the world.

The century terminating with the death of Augustus claims an undisputed
pre-eminence in the history of Roman eloquence and literature. Cicero,
the prince of Latin orators, now delivered those addresses which
perpetuate his fame; Sallust and Livy produced works which are still
regarded as models of historic composition; Horace, Virgil, and others,
acquired celebrity as gifted and accomplished poets. Among the subjects
fitted to exercise and expand the intellect, religion was not
overlooked. In the great cities of the empire many were to be found who
devoted themselves to metaphysical and ethical studies; and questions,
bearing upon the highest interests of man, were discussed in the schools
of the philosophers.

The barbarous nations under the dominion of Augustus derived many
advantages from their connexion with the Roman empire. They had, no
doubt, often reason to complain of the injustice and rapacity of
provincial governors; but, on the whole, they had a larger share of
social comfort than they could have enjoyed had they preserved their
independence; for their domestic feuds were repressed by the presence of
their powerful rulers, and the imperial armies were at hand to protect
them against foreign aggression. By means of the constant intercourse
kept up with all its dependencies, the skill and information of the
metropolis of Italy were gradually imparted to the rude tribes under its
sway, and thus the conquest of a savage country by the Romans was an
important step towards its civilisation. The union of so many nations in
a great state was otherwise beneficial to society. A Roman citizen might
travel without hindrance from Armenia to the British Channel; and as all
the countries washed by the Mediterranean were subject to the empire,
their inhabitants could carry on a regular and prosperous traffic by
availing themselves of the facilities of navigation.

The conquests of Rome modified the vernacular dialects of not a few of
its subjugated provinces, and greatly promoted the diffusion of Latin.
That language, which had gradually spread throughout Italy and the west
of Europe, was at length understood by persons of rank and education in
most parts of the empire. But in the time of Augustus, Greek was spoken
still more extensively. Several centuries before, it had been planted in
all the countries conquered by Alexander the Great, and it was now, not
only the most general, but also the most fashionable medium of
communication. Even Rome swarmed with learned Greeks, who employed their
native tongue when giving instruction in the higher branches of
education. Greece itself, however, was considered the head-quarters of
intellectual cultivation, and the wealthier Romans were wont to send
their sons to its celebrated seats of learning, to improve their
acquaintance with philosophy and literature.

The Roman Empire in the time of Augustus presents to the eye of
contemplation a most interesting spectacle, whether we survey its
territorial magnitude, its political power, or its intellectual
activity. But when we look more minutely at its condition, we may
discover many other strongly marked and less inviting features. That
stern patriotism, which imparted so much dignity to the old Roman
character, had now disappeared, and its place was occupied by ambition
or covetousness. Venality reigned throughout every department of the
public administration. Those domestic virtues, which are at once the
ornaments and the strength of the community, were comparatively rare;
and the prevalence of luxury and licentiousness proclaimed the unsafe
state of the social fabric. There was a growing disposition to evade the
responsibilities of marriage, and a large portion of the citizens of
Rome deliberately preferred the system of concubinage to the state of
wedlock. The civil wars, which had created such confusion and involved
such bloodshed, had passed away; but the peace which followed was,
rather the quietude of exhaustion, than the repose of contentment.

The state of the Roman Empire about the time of the birth of Christ
abundantly proves that there is no necessary connexion between
intellectual refinement and social regeneration. The cultivation of the
arts and sciences in the reign of Augustus may have been beneficial to a
few, by diverting them from the pursuit of vulgar pleasures, and opening
up to them sources of more rational enjoyment; but it is a most
humiliating fact that, during the brightest period in the history of
Roman literature, vice in every form was fast gaining ground among
almost all classes of the population. The Greeks, though occupying a
higher position as to mental accomplishments, were still more dissolute
than the Latins. Among them literature and sensuality appeared in
revolting combination, for their courtesans were their only females who
attended to the culture of the intellect. [7:1]

Nor is it strange that the Roman Empire at this period exhibited such a
scene of moral pollution. There was nothing in either the philosophy or
the religion of heathenism sufficient to counteract the influence of
man's native depravity. In many instances the speculations of the pagan
sages had a tendency, rather to weaken, than to sustain, the authority
of conscience. After unsettling the foundations of the ancient
superstition, the mind was left in doubt and bewilderment; for the
votaries of what was called wisdom entertained widely different views
even of its elementary principles. The Epicureans, who formed a large
section of the intellectual aristocracy, denied the doctrine of
Providence, and pronounced pleasure to be the ultimate end of man. The
Academics encouraged a spirit of disputatious scepticism; and the
Stoics, who taught that the practice of, what they rather vaguely
designated, virtue, involves its own reward, discarded the idea of a
future retribution. Plato had still a goodly number of disciples; and
though his doctrines, containing not a few elements of sublimity and
beauty, exercised a better influence, it must be admitted, after all,
that they constituted a most unsatisfactory system of cold and barren
mysticism. The ancient philosophers delivered many excellent moral
precepts; but, as they wanted the light of revelation, their arguments
in support of duty were essentially defective, and the lessons which
they taught had often very little influence either on themselves or
others. [8:1] Their own conduct seldom marked them out as greatly
superior to those around them, so that neither their instructions nor
their example contributed efficiently to elevate the character of their
generation.

Though the philosophers fostered a spirit of inquiry, yet, as they made
little progress in the discovery of truth, they were not qualified to
act with the skill and energy of enlightened reformers; and, whatever
may have been the amount of their convictions, they made no open and
resolute attack on the popular mythology. A very superficial examination
was, indeed, enough to shake the credit of the heathen worship. The
reflecting subjects of the Roman Empire might have remarked the very
awkward contrast between the multiplicity of their deities, and the
unity of their political government. It was the common belief that every
nation had its own divine guardians, and that the religious rites of one
country might be fully acknowledged without impugning the claims of
those of another; but still a thinking pagan might have been staggered
by the consideration that a human being had apparently more extensive
authority than some of his celestial overseers, and that the
jurisdiction of the Roman emperor was established over a more ample
territory than that which was assigned to many of the immortal gods.

But the multitude of its divinities was by no means the most offensive
feature of heathenism. The gods of antiquity, more particularly those of
Greece, were of an infamous character. Whilst they were represented by
their votaries as excelling in beauty and activity, strength and
intelligence, they were at the same time described as envious and
gluttonous, base, lustful, and revengeful. Jupiter, the king of the
gods, was deceitful and licentious; Juno, the queen of heaven, was cruel
and tyrannical. What could be expected from those who honoured such
deities? Some of the wiser heathens, such as Plato, [9:1] condemned
their mythology as immoral, for the conduct of one or other of the gods
might have been quoted in vindication of every species of transgression;
and had the Gentiles but followed the example of their own heavenly
hierarchy, they might have felt themselves warranted in pursuing a
course either of the most diabolical oppression, or of the most
abominable profligacy. [9:2]

At the time of the birth of our Lord even the Jews had sunk into a state
of the grossest degeneracy. They were now divided into sects, two of
which, the Pharisees and the Sadducees, are frequently mentioned in the
New Testament. The Pharisees were the leading denomination, being by far
the most numerous and powerful. By adding to the written law a mass of
absurd or frivolous traditions, which, as they foolishly alleged, were
handed down from Moses, they completely subverted the authority of the
sacred record, and changed the religion of the patriarchs and prophets
into a wearisome parade of superstitious observances. The Sadducees were
comparatively few, but as a large proportion of them were persons of
rank and wealth, they possessed a much greater amount of influence than
their mere numbers would have enabled them to command. It has been said
that they admitted the divine authority only of the Pentateuch, [10:1]
and though it may be doubted whether they openly ventured to deny the
claims of all the other books of the Old Testament, it is certain that
they discarded the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, [10:2] and
that they were disposed to self-indulgence and to scepticism. There was
another still smaller Jewish sect, that of the Essenes, of which there
is no direct mention in the New Testament. The members of this community
resided chiefly in the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea, and as our Lord
seldom visited that quarter of the country, it would appear that, during
the course of His public ministry, He rarely or never came in contact
with these religionists. Some of them were married, but the greater
number lived in celibacy, and spent much of their time in contemplation.
They are said to have had a common-stock purse, and their course of life
closely resembled that of the monks of after-times.

Though the Jews, as a nation, were now sunk in sensuality or
superstition, there were still some among them, such as Simeon and Anna,
noticed in the Gospel of Luke, [10:3] who were taught of God, and who
exhibited a spirit of vital piety. "The law of the Lord is perfect
converting the soul," and as the books of the Old Testament were
committed to the keeping of the posterity of Abraham, there were "hidden
ones" here and there who discovered the way to heaven by the perusal of
these "lively oracles." We have reason to believe that the Jews were
faithful conservators of the inspired volume, as Christ uniformly takes
for granted the accuracy of their "Scriptures." [11:1] It is an
important fact that they did not admit into their canon the writings now
known under the designation of the _Apocrypha_. [11:2] Nearly three
hundred years before the appearance of our Lord, the Old Testament had
been translated into the Greek language, and thus, at this period, the
educated portion of the population of the Roman Empire had all an
opportunity of becoming acquainted with the religion of the chosen
people. The Jews were now scattered over the earth, and as they erected
synagogues in the cities where they settled, the Gentile world had ample
means of information in reference to their faith and worship.

Whilst the dispersion of the Jews disseminated a knowledge of their
religion, it likewise suggested the approaching dissolution of the
Mosaic economy, as it was apparent that their present circumstances
absolutely required another ritual. It could not be expected that
individuals dwelling in distant countries could meet three times in the
year at Jerusalem to celebrate the great festivals. The Israelites
themselves had a presentiment of coming changes, and anxiously awaited
the appearance of a Messiah. They were actuated by an extraordinary zeal
for proselytism, [11:3] and though their scrupulous adherence to a stern
code of ceremonies often exposed them to much obloquy, they succeeded,
notwithstanding, in making many converts in most of the places where they
resided. [12:1] A prominent article of their creed was adopted in a
quarter where their theology otherwise found no favour, for the Unity of
the Great First Cause was now distinctly acknowledged in the schools of
the philosophers. [12:2]

From the preceding statements we may sec the peculiar significance of
the announcement that God sent forth His Son into the world "_when the
fulness of the time was come_." [12:3] Various predictions [12:4]
pointed out this age as the period of the Messiah's Advent, and
Gentiles, as well as Jews, seem by some means to have caught up the
expectation that an extraordinary personage was now about to appear on
the theatre of human existence. [12:5] Providence had obviously prepared
the way for the labours of a religious reformer. The civil wars which
had convulsed the state were now almost forgotten, and though the
hostile movements of the Germans, and other barbarous tribes on the
confines of the empire, occasionally created uneasiness or alarm, the
public mind was generally unoccupied by any great topic of absorbing
interest. In the populous cities the multitude languished for
excitement, and sought to dissipate the time in the forum, the circus,
or the amphitheatre. At such a crisis the heralds of the most gracious
message that ever greeted the ears of men might hope for a patient
hearing. Even the consolidation of so many nations under one government
tended to "the furtherance of the gospel," for the gigantic roads, which
radiated from Rome to the distant regions of the east and of the west,
facilitated intercourse; and the messengers of the Prince of Peace could
travel from country to country without suspicion and without passports.
And well might the Son of God be called "The desire of all nations."
[13:1] Though the wisest of the pagan sages could not have described the
renovation which the human family required, and though, when the
Redeemer actually appeared, He was despised and rejected of men, there
was, withal, a wide spread conviction that a Saviour was required, and
there was a longing for deliverance from the evils which oppressed
society. The ancient superstitions were rapidly losing their hold on the
affection and confidence of the people, and whilst the light of
philosophy was sufficient to discover the absurdities of the prevailing
polytheism, it failed to reveal any more excellent way of purity and
comfort. The ordinances of Judaism, which were "waxing old" and "ready
to vanish away," were types which were still unfulfilled; and though
they pointed out the path to glory, they required an interpreter to
expound their import. This Great Teacher now appeared. He was born in
very humble circumstances, and yet He was the heir of an empire beyond
comparison more illustrious than that of the Caesars. "There was given
him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and
languages, should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion,
which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be
destroyed." [13:2]

Nearly three years before the commencement of our era, [14:1] Jesus
Christ was born. The Holy Child was introduced into the world under
circumstances extremely humiliating. A decree had gone forth from Caesar
Augustus that all the Roman Empire should be taxed, and the Jews, as a
conquered people, were obliged to submit to an arrangement which
proclaimed their national degradation. The reputed parents of Jesus
resided at Nazareth, a town of Galilee; but, as they were "of the house
and lineage of David," they were obliged to repair to Bethlehem, a
village about six miles south of Jerusalem, to be entered in their
proper place in the imperial registry. "And so it was, that, while they
were there, the days were accomplished that Mary should be delivered,
and she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped him in swaddling
clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in
the inn." [14:2]

This child of poverty and of a despised race, born in the stable of the
lodging-house of an insignificant town belonging to a conquered
province, did not enter upon life surrounded by associations which
betokened a career of earthly prosperity. But intimations were not
wanting that the Son of Mary was regarded with the deepest interest by
the inhabitants of heaven. An angel had appeared to announce the
conception of the individual who was to be the herald of his ministry;
[15:1] and another angel had been sent to give notice of the incarnation
of this Great Deliverer. [15:2] When He was born, the angel of the Lord
communicated the tidings to shepherds in the plains of Bethlehem; "and
suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host
praising God and saying--Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good will toward men." [15:3] Inanimate nature called attention
to the advent of the illustrious babe, for a wonderful star made known
to wise men from the east the incarnation of the King of Israel; and
when they came to Jerusalem "the star, which they saw in the east, went
before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was."
[15:4] The history of these eastern sages cannot now be explored, and we
know not on what grounds they regarded the star as the sign of the
Messiah; but they rightly interpreted the appearance, and the narrative
warrants us to infer that they acted under the guidance of divine
illumination. As they were "warned of God in a dream" [15:5] to return
to their own country another way, we may presume that they were
originally directed by some similar communication to undertake the
journey. It is probable that they did not belong to the stock of
Abraham; and if so, their visit to the babe at Bethlehem may be
recognised as the harbinger of the union of Jews and Gentiles under the
new economy. The presence of these Orientals in Jerusalem attracted the
notice of the watchful and jealous tyrant who then occupied the throne
of Judea. Their story filled him with alarm; and his subjects
anticipated some tremendous outbreak of his suspicions and savage
temper. "When the king had heard these things he was troubled, and all
Jerusalem with him." [15:6] His rage soon vented itself in a terrible
explosion. Having ascertained from the chief priests and scribes of the
people where Christ was to be born, he "sent forth and slew all the
children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two
years old and under." [16:1]

Joseph and Mary, in accordance with a message from heaven, had meanwhile
fled towards the border of Egypt, and thus the holy infant escaped this
carnage. The wise men, on the occasion of their visit, had "opened their
treasures," and had "presented unto him gifts, _gold_, and frankincense,
and myrrh," [16:2] so that the poor travellers had providentially
obtained means for defraying the expenses of their journey. The
slaughter of the babes of Bethlehem was one of the last acts of the
bloody reign of Herod; and, on his demise, the exiles were divinely
instructed to return, and the child was presented in the temple. This
ceremony evoked new testimonies to His high mission. On His appearance
in His Father's house, the aged Simeon, moved by the Spirit from on
high, embraced Him as the promised Shiloh; and Anna, the prophetess,
likewise gave thanks to God, and "spake of him to all them that looked
for redemption in Jerusalem." [16:3] Thus, whilst the Old Testament
predictions pointed to Jesus as the Christ, living prophets appeared to
interpret these sacred oracles, and to bear witness to the claims of the
new-born Saviour.

Though the Son of Mary was beyond all comparison the most extraordinary
personage that ever appeared on earth, it is remarkable that the sacred
writers enter into scarcely any details respecting the history of His
infancy, His youth, or His early manhood. They tell us that "the child
grew and waxed strong in spirit," [17:1] and that He "increased in
wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man;" [17:2] but they do
not minutely trace the progress of His mental development, neither do
they gratify any feeling of mere curiosity by giving us His infantile
biography. In what is omitted by the penmen of the New Testament, as
well as in what is written we must acknowledge the guidance of
inspiration; and though we might have perused with avidity a description
of the pursuits of Jesus when a child, such a record has not been deemed
necessary for the illustration of the work of redemption. It would
appear that He spent about thirty years on earth almost unnoticed and
unknown; and He seems to have been meanwhile trained to the occupation
of a carpenter. [17:3] The obscurity of His early career must doubtless
be regarded as one part of His humiliation. But the circumstances in
which He was placed enabled Him to exhibit more clearly the divinity of
His origin. He did not receive a liberal education, so that when He came
forward as a public teacher "the Jews marvelled, saying--How knoweth
this man letters _having never learned?_" [17:4] When He was only twelve
years old, He was "found in the temple sitting in the midst of the
doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions; and all that
heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers." [18:1] As
He grew up, He was distinguished by His diligent attendance in the house
of God; and it seems not improbable that He was in the habit of
officiating at public worship by assisting in the reading of the law and
the prophets; for we are told that, shortly after the commencement of
His ministry, "He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and,
as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath-day, and
_stood up for to read_." [18:2]

When He was about thirty years of age, and immediately before His public
appearance as a prophet, our Lord was baptized of John in Jordan. [18:3]
The Baptist did not, perhaps, preach longer than six months, [18:4] but
it is probable that during his imprisonment of considerably upwards of a
year, he still contributed to prepare the way of Christ; for, in the
fortress of Machaerus in which he was incarcerated, [18:5] he was not
kept in utter ignorance of passing occurrences, and when permitted to
hold intercourse with his friends, he would doubtless direct their
special attention to the proceedings of the Great Prophet. The claims of
John, as a teacher sent from God, were extensively acknowledged; and
therefore his recognition of our Lord as the promised Messiah, must have
made a deep impression upon the minds of the Israelites. The miracles of
our Saviour corroborated the testimony of His forerunner, and created a
deep sensation. He healed "all manner of sickness, and all manner of
disease." [19:1] It was, consequently, not strange that "His fame went
throughout all Syria," and that "there followed him great multitudes of
people, from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from
Judea, and from beyond Jordan." [19:2]

Even when the Most High reveals himself there is something mysterious in
the manifestation, so that, whilst we acknowledge the tokens of His
presence, we may well exclaim--"Verily thou art a God that hidest
thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour." [19:3] When He displayed His
glory in the temple of old, He filled it with thick darkness; [19:4]
when He delivered the sure word of prophecy, He employed strange and
misty language; when He announced the Gospel itself, He uttered some
things hard to be understood. It might have been said, too, of the Son
of God, when He appeared on earth, that His "footsteps were not known."
In early life He does not seem to have arrested the attention of His own
townsmen; and when He came forward to assert His claims as the Messiah,
He did not overawe or dazzle his countrymen by any sustained
demonstration of tremendous power or of overwhelming splendour. To-day
the multitude beheld His miracles with wonder, but to-morrow they could
not tell where to meet with Him; [19:5] ever and anon He appeared and
disappeared; and occasionally His own disciples found it difficult to
discover the place of His retirement. When He arrived in a district,
thousands often hastily gathered around Him; [19:6] but He never
encouraged the attendance of vast assemblages by giving general notice
