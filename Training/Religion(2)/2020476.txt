Dedication of Children.


1   This child we dedicate to thee,
    O God of grace and purity;
    Shield it from sin and threatening wrong,
    And let thy love its life prolong.

2   O, may thy Spirit gently draw
    Its willing soul to keep thy law;
    May virtue, piety and truth
    Dawn even with its dawning youth.

3   Grant that, with true and faithful heart,
    We too may act the Christian's part,
    Cheered by each promise thou hast given,
    And laboring for the prize in heaven.

Children commended to Christ.


1   Saviour, who thy flock art feeding
      With the shepherd's kindest care,
    All the feeble gently leading,
      While the lambs thy bosom share,--

2   Now, these little ones receiving,
      Fold them in thy gracious arm;
    There, we know--thy word believing,--
      Only there, secure from harm.

3   Never, from thy pasture roving,
      Let them be the lion's prey;
    Let thy tenderness, so loving,
      Keep them all life's dangerous way.

4   Then within thy fold eternal
      Let them find a resting-place;
    Feed in pastures ever vernal,
      Drink the rivers of thy grace.

Christ calling Children to Himself.


1     The Saviour gently calls
      Our children to his breast;
    He folds them in his gracious arms;
      Himself declares them blest.

2     "Let them approach," he cries,
      "Nor scorn their humble claim;
    The heirs of heaven are such as these,--
      For such as these I came."

3     Gladly we bring them, Lord,
      Devoting them to thee:
    Imploring, that, as we are thine,
      Thine may our offspring be.

Infant Baptism.


1   Drop the limpid waters now
    On the infant's sinless brow;
    Dedicate the unfolding gem
    Unto Him, who blessed the stem.

2   Let our aspirations be
    Innocent as infancy;
    Pure the prayers that force their way,
    As the child for whom we pray.

3   In the Christian garden we
    Plant another Christian tree;
    Be its blossoms and its fruit
    Worthy of the Christian root.

4   To that garden now we bring
    Waters from the living spring;
    Bless the tree, the waters bless,
    Holy One! with holiness.

5   When life's harvests all are past,
    Oh, transplant the tree at last,
    To the fields where flower and tree
    Blossom through eternity.

Hymn for Baptism.


1   Baptized into our Saviour's death,
      Our souls to sin must die;
    With Christ our Lord we live anew,
      With Christ ascend on high.

2   There, by his Father's side he sits,
      Enthroned divinely fair,
    Yet owns himself our Brother still,
      And our Forerunner there.

3   Rise from these earthly trifles, rise
      On wings of faith and love;
    Above our choicest treasure lies,--
      And be our hearts above.

4   But earth and sin will draw us down,
      When we attempt to fly;
    Lord, send thy strong, attractive power
      To fix our souls on high.

      Thy pure example bless,
    And with a firm, unwavering zeal,
      Would in thy footsteps press.

2     Not to the fiery pains
      By which the martyrs bled;
    Not to the scourge, the thorn, the cross,
      Our favored feet are led;--

3     But, at this peaceful tide,
      Assembled in thy fear,
    The homage of obedient hearts
      We humbly offer here.

2   With cheerful feet may they advance,
      And run the Christian race,
    And, through the troubles of the way,
      Find all-sufficient grace.

3   Lord, plant us all into thy death,
      That we thy life may prove,--
    Partakers of thy cross beneath,
      And of thy crown above.

2   Now rest, my long divided heart;
      Fixed on this blissful centre, rest:
    Here have I found a nobler part;
      Here heavenly pleasures fill my breast.

3   High heaven, that hears the solemn vow,
      That vow renewed shall daily hear,
    Till in life's latest hour I bow,
      And bless in death a bond so dear.

      To look on thee, and mourn.

    Let each exclaim in faith and hope,
      "The Saviour died for me!"

2   Not here, where met to think on him,
      Whose latest thoughts were ours,
    Shall mortal passions come to dim
      The prayer devotion pours.

3   No, gracious Master, not in vain
      Thy life of love hath been;
    The peace thou gav'st may yet remain,
      Though thou no more art seen.

    When heaven shall ope its glorious gate.
      And God be all in all.

1   'Twas on that dark, that doleful night,
      When all the powers of darkness rose
    Against the Son of God's delight,
      And friends betrayed him to his foes:

2   Before the mournful scene began,
      He took the bread, and blessed, and brake:
    What love through all his actions ran!
      What wondrous words of grace he spake!

3   "This is my body broke for sin;
      Receive and eat the living food:"
    Then took the cup and blessed the wine,--
      "'Tis the new covenant in my blood."

      In memory of your dying Friend;
    Meet at my table, and record
      The love of your departed Lord."

    Thy dying love the noblest praise
      Our hearts can offer thee transcends.

1   The perfect world by Adam trod,
    Was the first temple,--built by God;
    His fiat laid the corner-stone,
    And heaved its pillars, one by one.

2   He hung its starry roof on high,--
    The broad, illimitable sky;
    He spread its pavement, green and bright
    And curtained it with morning light.

3   The mountains in their places stood,--
    The sea, the sky,--and "all was good;"
    And when its first pure praises rang,
    The "morning stars together sang."

4   Lord! 'tis not ours to make the sea,
    And earth and sky a house for thee;
    But in thy sight our offering stands,
    A humbler temple, "made with hands."

1   O, bow thine ear, Eternal One!
      On thee our heart adoring calls;
    To thee the followers of thy Son
      Have raised and now devote these walls.

2   Here let thy holy days be kept;
      And be this place to worship given,
    Like that bright spot where Jacob slept,
      The house of God, the gate of heaven.

3   Here may thine honor dwell; and here,
      As incense, let thy children's prayer,
    From contrite hearts and lips sincere,
      Rise on the still and holy air.

4   Here be thy praise devoutly sung;
      Here let thy truth beam forth to save,
    As when, of old, thy spirit hung,
      On wings of light, o'er Jordan's wave.

5   And when the lips, that with thy name
      Are vocal now, to dust shall turn,
    On others may devotion's flame
      Be kindled here, and purely burn!

1   Father, lo! we consecrate
      Unto thee this house and shrine,
    Oh! may Jesus visit here,
      As he did in Palestine.
    Here may blind eyes see his light,
      Deaf ears hear his accents sweet,
    And we, like those groups of old,
      Sit and linger at his feet.

2   And to learn of faith and love,
      Strong in sorrow, pain and loss,
    May we come and find them here,
      In the garden, on the cross.
    Like the spices that enfold
      Him we love in rich perfume,
    May our thoughts embalm him here,
      While he slumbers in the tomb.

3   When we watch by shrouded hopes,
      Weeping at death's marble door,
    May the angels meet us here--
      Lo! your Christ has gone before!
    And while we stand "looking up,"
      In our faith and wonder lost,
    Here send down thy Spirit's power,
      Like the tongues of Pentecost.

God's Temple in the Heart.


1   Who shall a temple build for him,
      Who fills the heaven of heavens alone?
    Who shall exalt his glorious name,
      Fixed in his everlasting throne?

2   Yet many a lowly fane shall rise,
      Which God himself will not disdain:
    He will accept the sacrifice;
      Nor shall the offering e'er be vain.

3   No gorgeous dome, nor boastful vow,
      Can e'er find favor in his sight:
    The humble votary, meek and low,--
      The holy soul, are his delight.

4   On these his grace and mercy rest,
      Nor from their shrines will he depart:
    His temple is the righteous breast;
      His altar is the pious heart.

Dedication Hymn.


1     Thou Fount of love and grace,
        Whose throne is fixed on high,
      Unveil thy smiling face,
        And to our souls draw nigh;
    And let our prayers and praise arise,
    Like grateful incense to the skies.

2     This house to thee we give--
        Thine may it ever be--
      Here bid the sinner live,
        Here set the captive free,
    Here let thy word its beams display
    And safely guide to endless day.

3     Here may the stricken heart
        By truth be cheered and blessed,
      And here thy grace impart,
        To all by grief oppressed--
    And streams of peace and plenty flow,
    To all who seek thy joy to know.

4     Long may these walls resound
        With thy salvation, Lord,
      And grace to all abound,
        Who hear thy holy word--
    And youth and age their offerings raise.
    In songs of ardent, cheerful praise.

Dedication of a Country Church.


1   On this fair spot where nature pays
      From hill, and vale, and flower, and tree,
    In morning beams, in evening rays,
      Its homage, God of all, to thee;--

2   Thy children meet to dedicate
      This temple to thy gracious name;
    Our hearts and songs to elevate,--
      Thy grace and glory to proclaim.

3   Descend--and with thy spirit bless
      The offering; may it ever be
    Sacred to truth and righteousness,
      From error's dread dominion free.

4   Here let the standard of thy word
      Be raised and held by gospel hands;
    Hither bring hearts with one accord,
      To learn and do thy great commands.

5   And when we leave these courts below,
      To join the hosts in praise above,
    May others here rejoice to know
      Thy boundless, everlasting love.

Dedication Hymn.


1   O Thou, whose own vast temple stands,
      Built over earth and sea,
    Accept the walls that human hands
      Have raised to worship thee.

2   Lord, from thine inmost glory send,
      Within these courts to bide,
    The peace that dwelleth, without end,
      Serenely by thy side.

3   May erring minds that worship here
      Be taught the better way,
    And they who mourn, and they who fear,
      Be strengthened as they pray!

4   May faith grow firm, and love grow warm,
      And pure devotion rise,
    While round these hallowed walls the storm
      Of earth-born passion dies!

A House for God.


1   Where shall we go to seek and find
      A habitation for our God?
    A dwelling for th' Eternal Mind
      Among the sons of flesh and blood?

2   The God of Jacob chose the hill
      Of Zion for his ancient rest;
    And Zion is his dwelling still;
      His church is with his presence blest.

3   Here will he meet the hungry poor,
      And fill their souls with living bread;
    Here sinners, waiting at his door,
      With sweet provision shall be fed.

4   "Here will I fix my gracious throne,
      And reign forever," saith the Lord;
    "Here shall my power and love be known,
      And blessings shall attend my word."
