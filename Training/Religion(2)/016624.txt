PREFACE


It was the purpose of each edition of this pamphlet to benefit no favored
class, but, according to the apostle's admonition, to "reprove, rebuke,
exhort," and with the power and self-sacrificing spirit of Love to correct
involuntary as well as voluntary error.

By a modification of the language, the import of this edition is, we trust,
transparent to the hearts of all conscientious laborers in the realm of
Mind-healing. To those who are athirst for the life-giving waters of a true
divinity, it saith tenderly, "Come and drink;" and if you are babes in
Christ, leave the meat and take the unadulterated milk of the Word, until
you grow to apprehend the pure spirituality of Truth.

INTRODUCTION


To kindle in all minds a common sentiment of regard for the spiritual idea
emanating from the infinite, is a most needful work; but this must be done
gradually, for Truth is as "the still, small voice," which comes to our
recognition only as our natures are changed by its silent influence.

Small streams are noisy and rush precipitately; and babbling brooks fill
the rivers till they rise in floods, demolishing bridges and overwhelming
cities. So men, when thrilled by a new idea, are sometimes impatient; and,
when public sentiment is aroused, are liable to be borne on by the current
of feeling. They should then turn temporarily from the tumult, for the
silent cultivation of the true idea and the quiet practice of its virtues.
When the noise and stir of contending sentiments cease, and the flames die
away on the mount of revelation, we can read more clearly the tablets of
Truth.

The theology and medicine of Jesus were one,--in the divine oneness of the
trinity, Life, Truth, and Love, which healed the sick and cleansed the
sinful. This trinity in unity, correcting the individual thought, is the
only Mind-healing I vindicate; and on its standard have emblazoned that
crystallized expression, CHRISTIAN SCIENCE.

A spurious and hydra-headed mind-healing is naturally glared at by the
pulpit, ostracized by the medical faculty, and scorned by people of common
sense. To aver that disease is normal, a God-bestowed and stubborn reality,
but that you can heal it, leaves you to work against that which is natural
and a law of being. It is scientific to rob disease of all reality; and to
accomplish this, you cannot begin by admitting its reality. Our Master
taught his students to deny self, sense, and take up the cross. Mental
healers who admit that disease is real should be made to test the
feasibility of what they say by healing one case audibly, through such an
admission,--if this is possible. I have healed more disease by the spoken
than the unspoken word.

The honest student of Christian Science is modest in his claims and
conscientious in duty, waiting and working to mature what he has been
taught. Institutes furnished with such teachers are becoming beacon-lights
along the shores of erudition; and many who are not teachers have large
practices and some marked success in healing the most defiant forms of
