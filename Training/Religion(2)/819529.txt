castes are "twice-born." The first birth is from the natural mother;
the second from the ligation of the zone; the third from the due
performance of the sacrifice: such are the births of him who is
usually called twice-born, according to the text of the Veda: among
them his divine birth is that which is distinguished by the ligation
of the zone and sacrificial cord, and in that birth the Gayatri is his
mother, and the Acharya his father. MENU, ii. 169.]

[Footnote 89: p. 40. l. 6. _Best of trees, the Asoca blooming_. The Asoca is a
shrub consecrated to Mahadeva; men and women of all classes ought to
bathe, on a particular day, in some holy stream, especially the
Brahma-putra, and drink water with the buds of the Asoca floating in
it. This shrub is planted near the temples of Siva, and grows
abundantly on Ceylon. Sita is said to have been confined in a grove of
it, while in captivity by Ravana; other relators say that she was
confined in a place or house called Asocavan. The Asoca is a plant of
the first order of the eighth class, of leguminous fructification, and
bears flowers of exquisite beauty. Van Rheede (Hortus Malab. vol. v.
tab. 59.) calls it Asjogam. See Asiatic Researches, iii. 254, 277.

Euripides, is called '[Greek: 'Elenas], the destroyer of ships.' Many
other instances will occur to the classical reader. In Malati and
Madhava, the forlorn lover in turn addresses different objects of
nature, the clouds, the birds, and the elephants, to inform him whether
they have seen his lost mistress. ACT ix. See, however, Mr. WILSON's

In Indian mythology, eclipses are caused by the dragon Rahu attempting
to swallow up the moon. The origin of their hostility is given in a
passage quoted by Mr. Wilkins from the Mahabharata, in his notes to
the Bhagavat-Gita:--"And so it fell out that when the Soors were
quenching their thirst for immortality, Rahu, an Asoor, assumed the
form of a Soor, and begun to drink also; and the water had but reached
his throat, when the sun and moon, in friendship to the Soors,
discovered the deceit, and instantly Narayan cut off his head as he
was drinking, with his splendid weapon, chakra. And the gigantic head
of the Asoor, emblem of a monstrous summit, being thus separated from
his body by the chakra's edge, bounded into the heavens with a
dreadful cry, whilst the ponderous trunk fell, cleaving the ground
asunder, and shaking the whole earth unto its foundations, with all
its islands, rocks, and forest. And from this time the head of Rahu
resolved on eternal enmity, and continueth even unto this day at times
to seize upon the sun and moon." p. 149.]

lunar asterism, figured by a wheeled carriage, and containing five
stars, probably [Greek: a b g d e], Tauri. In mythology the asterism is

[Footnote 118: p. 63. l. 9. _To desire this deed unholy._ A second marriage in
a woman is considered in India an inexpiable breach of conjugal
fidelity. "A virtuous wife ascends to heaven, though she have no
child, if after the decease of her lord she devotes herself to pious
austerity. But a widow, who from a wish to bear children, slights her
deceased husband by marrying again, brings disgrace on herself here
below, and shall be excluded from the seat of her lord." MENU, v,
160-161. "She who neglects her former (purva) lord, though of a lower
class, and takes another (para) of a higher, becomes despicable in
this world, and is called para purva, or one who had a different
husband before." Ibid. 163.]

head 2, chest 2, ribs 2, flanks 2, crupper 1. In the Magha, v. 9, we
have the term Avarttina applied to horses; on which the commentator
observes, "Avarttina signifies horses having the ten Avarttas, marks
of excellence; they are, two on the breast, two on the head, two on
the hollows of the ribs, two on the hollows of the flanks, and one on
the crupper (Prapata); these are called the ten Avarttas. Avartta
means an eddy, or whirlpool, and the name is applied to dispositions
of the hair of a horse which resemble a whirlpool." WILSON.]

THE DESCENT OF THE GANGES.

FIRST PRINTED IN THE QUARTERLY REVIEW, VOL. XLV.


The descent of the Ganges is the sequel of another fiction still more
monstrous, but perhaps one of the most singular of the cosmogonical
notions of the ancient Indians. Sagara, the king of Ayodhya (Oude),
was without offspring--in almost all eastern countries the most
grievous calamity incident to man, more especially to those of noble
or royal race. By the most surpassing penances he obtains an oracle
from the wise Brighu, predicting that one of his wives will bring
forth a single son, the other _sixty thousand_! Accordingly the fair
Cesina gives birth to Asamanja; his other wife to a gourd, which, like
the egg of Leda, is instinct with life. From the seeds of this gourd,
preserved with great care, and fed with ghee, come forth in due time
the sixty thousand boys. The son of Cesina was a youth of the most
malicious and cruel disposition; his pastime was to throw little
infants into the river, and solace himself with their cries. He is
sent into exile by his just and humane father, where he has a son,
Ansuman, as gentle and popular as Asamanja was malignant and odious.
King Sagara prepares to offer the Aswameda, the famous sacrifice of
the horse. The holy and untouched steed is led forth, as in the 'Curse
of Kehama,' among the admiring multitude, by the youthful Ansuman,
when on a sudden a monstrous serpent arises from the earth, and drags
it into the abyss. Sagara, in wrath, commands his sixty thousand sons
to undertake the recovery of the steed from the malignant demon who
has thus interrupted the sacrifice. Having searched long in vain, they
begin to dig into the bowels of the earth, until,--

    'Cloven with shovel and with hoe, pierced by axes and by spades,
    Shrieked the earth in frantic woe; rose from out the yawning shades
    Yells of anguish, hideous roars from the expiring brood of hell--
    Serpents, giants, and Asoors, in the deep abyss that dwell.
