Ave Maria! The night shades are falling,
Softly our voices arise unto thee,
Earth's lonely exiles for succor are calling,
Sinless and beautiful Star of the Sea!

3.
Ave Maria! Thy children are kneeling,
Words of endearment are murmured to thee;
Softly thy spirit upon us is stealing
Sinless and beautiful Star of the Sea!

4.
Ave Maria! Thou portal of Heaven,
Harbor of refuge, to thee we do flee:
Lost in the darkness, by stormy winds driven,
Shine on our pathway, fair Star of the Sea!

Daily, daily sing to Mary (A)
Omni die dic Mariae

Translated by Father Bittlestone
Traditional Melody
Arr. by N. A. M.


With spirit

1.
Daily, daily sing of Mary,
Sing, my soul, her praises due;
All her feats, her actions worship
With the hearts devotion true.
Lost in wond'ring contemplation,
Be her majesty confest!
Call her Mother, call her Virgin,
Happy Mother, Virgin blest!

2.
She is mighty to deliver;
Call her, trust her lovingly:
When the tempest rages round thee,
She will calm the troubled sea.
Gifts of Heaven she has given
Noble lady! To our race:
She, the Queen, who decks her subjects
With the light of God's own grace.

3.
Sing my tongue, the Virgin's trophies,
Who for us our Maker bore;
For the curse of old inflicted,
Peace and blessing to restore.
Sing the songs of praise unending
Sing the world's majestic Queen.
Weary not nor faint in telling
All the gifts she gives to men.

4.
All my senses, heart, affections,
Strive to sound her glory forth:
Spread abroad the sweet memorials
Of the Virgin's priceless worth:
Where the voice of music thrilling,
Where the tongue of eloquence,
That can utter hymns beseeming
All her matchless excellence?

Andante religioso

1.
Mother of mercy, day by day,
My love of thee grows more and more;
Thy gifts are strewn upon my way
Like sands upon the great seashore.
Thy gifts are strewn upon my way
Like sands upon the great seashore.

2.
Though poverty and work and woe
The masters of my life may be,
When times are worst who does not know
Darkness is light with love of thee?
When times are worst who does not know
Darkness is light with love of thee?

3.
But scornful men have coldly said
Thy love was leading me from God;
And yet in this I did but tread
The very path my Saviour trod.
And yet in this I did but tread
The very path my Saviour trod.

4.
They know but little of Thy worth
Who speak the heartless words to me,
For what did Jesus love on earth
One half so tenderly as thee?
For what did Jesus love on earth
One half so tenderly as thee?

O purest of creatures

The Immaculate Conception
Father Faber
Nicola A. Montani


Slowly

1.
O purest of the creatures! Sweet Mother, sweet maid!
The one spotless womb wherein Jesus was laid!
Dark night hath come down on us Mother! And we
Look out for thy shining, sweet Star of the Sea!
Look out for thy shining, sweet Star of the Sea!

2.
Deep night hath come down on this rough-spoken world,
And the banners of darkness are boldly unfurl'd:
And the tempest-tost Church all her eyes are on Thee,
They look to thy shining, sweet Star of the Sea!
They look to thy shining, sweet Star of the Sea!

3.
The Church doth what God had first taught her to do;
He looked o'er the world to find hearts that were true;
Thro' the ages He looked, and He found none but thee,
And He loved thy clear shining, sweet Star of the Sea!
And He loved thy clear shining, sweet Star of the Sea!

4.
He gazed on thy soul; it was spotless and fair;
For the empire of sin it had never been there;
None had ever owned thee, dear Mother, but He,
And He bless'd thy clear shining, sweet Star of the Sea!
And He bless'd thy clear shining, sweet Star of the Sea!

Whither thus, in holy rapture?
Quo sanctus ardor te rapit

The Visitation
Translated by the Rev. E. Caswall from a Slovak Hymnal
Arr. by N. A. M.


Joyously

1.
Wither thus in holy rapture,
Royal maiden, art thou bent?
Why so fleetly art thou speeding
Up the mountain's rough ascent?
Filled with th'Eternal Godhead!
Glowing with the Spirit's flame!
Love it is that bears the onward,
And supports thy tender frame.

2.
Lo thine aged cousin claims thee,
Claims thy sympathy and care;
God her shame from her hath taken,
He hath heard her fervent pray'r.
Blessed Mothers! Joyful meeting!
Thou in her, the hand of God,
She in thee, with lips inspired,
Owns the Mother of her Lord.

3.
As the sun, his face concealing,
In a cloud withdraws from sight,
So in Mary then lay hidden
He Who is the world's true light.
Honor, glory, virtue, merit,
Be to Thee, O Virgin's Son!
With the Father, and the Spirit,
While eternal ages run.

Hail Virgin, dearest Mary!

A spotless, blessed Lady,
Our lovely Queen of May.
Thy children, humbly bending,
Surround thy shrine so dear;
With heart and voice ascending,
Sweet Mary, hear our pray'r.

Behold earth's blossoms springing
In beauteous form and hue.
All nature gladly bring
Her sweetest charms to you.
We'll gather fresh, bright flowers,
To bind our fair queen's brow;
From gay and verdant bowers,
We haste to crown thee now.

Hail Virgin, dearest Mary!

O spotless blessed Lady,
Our lovely Queen of May.
And now, our blessed Mother,
Smile on our festal day;
Accept our wreath of flowers,
And be our Queen of May.

Month of Mary
Crowning Hymn
Tr. Rev. E. Caswall from a Slovak Hymnal
Arr. by N.A.M


Joyously: Moderato

1.
This is the image of the Queen
Who reigns in bliss above;
Of her who is the hope of men,
Whom men and angels Love!
Most holy Mary! at thy feet
I bend a suppliant knee;
In this thy own sweet month of May,
Dear Mother of my God, I pray,
Do thou remember me.

2.
This homage offered at the feet
Of Mary's image here
To Mary's self at once ascends
Above the starry sphere.
Most holy Mary! at thy feet
I bend a suppliant knee;
In all my joy, in all my pain,
O Virgin born without a stain,
Do thou remember me.

3.
How fair soever be the form
Which here your eyes behold,
Its beauty is by Mary's self
Excell'd a thousand-fold.
Most holy Mary! At thy feet
I bend a suppliant knee;
In my temptations each and all
From Eve derived in Adam's fall,
Do thou remember me.

4.
Sweet are the flowerets we have called
This image to adorn;
But sweeter far is Mary's self,
That rose without a thorn!
Most holy Mary! At thy feet
I bend a suppliant knee;
When on the bed of death I lie,
By Him who did for sinners die,
Do thou remember me.
