action, material force or energy; it is not organized dust.
God, Spirit, Mind, are terms synonymous for the one
God, whose reflection is creation, and man is His image
and likeness. Few there are who comprehend what Chris-
tian Science means by the word _reflection_. God is seen [25]
only in that which reflects good, Life, Truth, Love--
yea, which manifests all His attributes and power, even
as the human likeness thrown upon the mirror repeats
precisely the looks and actions of the object in front of it.
All must be Mind and Mind's ideas; since, according to [30]
natural science, God, Spirit, could not change its species
and evolve matter.

[Page 24.]

These facts enjoin the First Commandment; and [1]
knowledge of them makes man spiritually minded. St.
Paul writes: "For to be carnally minded is death; but to
be spiritually minded is life and peace." This knowl-
edge came to me in an hour of great need; and I give it [5]
to you as death-bed testimony to the daystar that dawned
on the night of material sense. This knowledge is
practical, for it wrought my immediate recovery from
an injury caused by an accident, and pronounced fatal
by the physicians. On the third day thereafter, I called [10]
for my Bible, and opened it at Matthew ix. 2. As I
read, the healing Truth dawned upon my sense; and
the result was that I rose, dressed myself, and ever after
was in better health than I had before enjoyed. That
short experience included a glimpse of the great fact [15]
that I have since tried to make plain to others, namely,
Life in and of Spirit; this Life being the sole reality of
existence. I learned that mortal thought evolves a sub-
jective state which it names matter, thereby shutting
out the true sense of Spirit. _Per contra_, Mind and man [20]
are immortal; and knowledge gained from mortal sense
is illusion, error, the opposite of Truth; therefore it
cannot be true. A knowledge of both good and evil
(when good is God, and God is All) is impossible. Speak-
ing of the origin of evil, the Master said: "When he [25]
speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar,
and the father of it." God warned man not to believe
the talking serpent, or rather the allegory describing
it. The Nazarene Prophet declared that his followers
should handle serpents; that is, put down all subtle falsi- [30]
ties or illusions, and thus destroy any supposed effect
arising from false claims exercising their supposed power

[Page 25.]

on the mind and body of man against his holiness and [1]
health.

That there is but one God or Life, one cause and
one effect, is the _multum in parvo_ of Christian Science;
and to my understanding it is the heart of Christianity, [5]
the religion that Jesus taught and demonstrated. In
divine Science it is found that matter is a phase of
error, and that neither one really exists, since God is
Truth, and All-in-all. Christ's Sermon on the Mount,
in its direct application to human needs, confirms this [10]
conclusion.

Science, understood, translates matter into Mind,
rejects all other theories of causation, restores the spir-
itual and original meaning of the Scriptures, and ex-
plains the teachings and life of our Lord. It is religion's [15]
"new tongue," with "signs following," spoken of by
St. Mark. It gives God's infinite meaning to mankind,
healing the sick, casting out evil, and raising the spirit-
ually dead. Christianity is Christlike only as it re-
iterates the word, repeats the works, and manifests the [20]
spirit of Christ.

Jesus' only medicine was omnipotent and omniscient
Mind. As _omni_ is from the Latin word meaning _all_,
this medicine is all-power; and omniscience means as
well, all-science. The sick are more deplorably situated [25]
than the sinful, if the sick cannot trust God for help and
the sinful can. If God created drugs good, they cannot be
harmful; if He could create them otherwise, then they
are bad and unfit for man; and if He created drugs for
healing the sick, why did not Jesus employ them and [30]
recommend them for that purpose?

No human hypotheses, whether in philosophy, medi-

[Page 26.]

cine, or religion, can survive the wreck of time; but [1]
whatever is of God, hath life abiding in it, and ulti-
mately will be known as self-evident truth, as demonstra-
ble as mathematics. Each successive period of progress
is a period more humane and spiritual. The only logical [5]
conclusion is that all is Mind and its manifestation, from
the rolling of worlds, in the most subtle ether, to a potato-
patch.

The agriculturist ponders the history of a seed, and
believes that his crops come from the seedling and the [10]
loam; even while the Scripture declares He made "every
plant of the field before it was in the earth." The Scien-
tist asks, Whence came the first seed, and what made
the soil? Was it molecules, or material atoms? Whence
came the infinitesimals,--from infinite Mind, or from [15]
matter? If from matter, how did matter originate? Was
it self-existent? Matter is not intelligent, and thus able
to evolve or create itself: it is the very opposite of Spirit,
intelligent, self-creative, and infinite Mind. The belief
of mind in matter is pantheism. Natural history shows [20]
that neither a genus nor a species produces its opposite.
God is All, in all. What can be more than All? Noth-
ing: and this is just what I call matter, _nothing_. Spirit,
God, has no antecedent; and God's consequent is the
spiritual cosmos. The phrase, "express image," in the [25]
common version of Hebrews i. 3, is, in the Greek Tes-
tament, _character_.

The Scriptures name God as good, and the Saxon
term for God is also good. From this premise comes
the logical conclusion that God is naturally and divinely [30]
infinite good. How, then, can this conclusion change,
or be changed, to mean that good is evil, or the creator

[Page 27.]

of evil? What can there be besides infinity? Nothing! [1]
Therefore the Science of good calls evil _nothing_. In
divine Science the terms God and good, as Spirit, are
synonymous. That God, good, creates evil, or aught
that can result in evil,--or that Spirit creates its oppo- [5]
site, named matter,--are conclusions that destroy their
premise and prove themselves invalid. Here is where
Christian Science sticks to its text, and other systems
of religion abandon their own logic. Here also is found
the pith of the basal statement, the cardinal point in [10]
Christian Science, that matter and evil (including all
inharmony, sin, disease, death) are _unreal_. Mortals
accept natural science, wherein no species ever pro-
duces its opposite. Then why not accept divine Sci-
ence on this ground? since the Scriptures maintain [15]
this fact by parable and proof, asking, "Do men
gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?" "Doth a
fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and
bitter?"

According to reason and revelation, evil and matter [20]
are negation: for evil signifies the absence of good, God,
though God is ever present; and matter claims some-
thing besides God, when God is really _All_. Creation,
evolution, or manifestation,--being in and of Spirit,
Mind, and all that really is,--must be spiritual and [25]
mental. This is Science, and is susceptible of proof.

But, say you, is a stone spiritual?

To erring material sense, No! but to unerring spiritual
sense, it is a small manifestation of Mind, a type of spirit-
ual substance, "the substance of things hoped for." [30]
Mortals can know a stone as substance, only by first ad-
mitting that it is substantial. Take away the mortal sense

[Page 28.]

of substance, and the stone itself would disappear, only [1]
to reappear in the spiritual sense thereof. Matter can
neither see, hear, feel, taste, nor smell; having no sen-
sation of its own. Perception by the five personal senses
is mental, and dependent on the beliefs that mortals [5]
entertain. Destroy the belief that you can walk, and
volition ceases; for muscles cannot move without mind.
Matter takes no cognizance of matter. In dreams, things
are only what mortal mind makes them; and the phe-
nomena of mortal life are as dreams; and this so-called [10]
life is a dream soon told. In proportion as mortals turn
from this mortal and material dream, to the true sense
of reality, everlasting Life will be found to be the only
Life. That death does not destroy the beliefs of the flesh,
our Master proved to his doubting disciple, Thomas. Also, [15]
he demonstrated that divine Science alone can overbear
materiality and mortality; and this great truth was shown
is by his ascension after death, whereby he arose above
the illusion of matter.

The First Commandment, "Thou shalt have no other [20]
gods before me," suggests the inquiry, What meaneth
this Me,--Spirit, or matter? It certainly does not
signify a graven idol, and must mean Spirit. Then
the commandment means, Thou shalt recognize no
intelligence nor life in matter; and find neither pleasure [25]
nor pain therein. The Master's practical knowledge
of this grand verity, together with his divine Love,
healed the sick and raised the dead. He literally
annulled the claims of physique and of physical law,
by the superiority of the higher law; hence his decla- [30]
ration, "These signs shall follow them that believe;...
if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them;

[Page 29.]

they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." [1]

Do you believe his words? I do, and that his prom-
ise is perpetual. Had it been applicable only to his
immediate disciples, the pronoun would be _you_, not _them_. [5]
The purpose of his life-work touches universal human-
ity. At another time he prayed, not for the twelve
only, but "for them also which shall believe on me through
their word."

The Christ-healing was practised even before the Christ- [10]
ian era; "the Word was with God, and the Word was
God." There is, however, no analogy between Christian
Science and spiritualism, or between it and any specu-
lative theory.

In 1867, I taught the first student in Christian Science. [15]
Since that date I have known of but fourteen deaths
in the ranks of my about five thousand students. The
census since 1875 (the date of the first publication of
my work, "Science and Health with Key to the Scrip-
tures") shows that longevity has _increased_. Daily letters [20]
inform me that a perusal of my volume is healing the
writers of chronic and acute diseases that had defied medi-
cal skill.

Surely the people of the Occident know that esoteric
magic and Oriental barbarisms will neither flavor Chris- [25]
tianity nor advance health and length of days.

Miracles are no infraction of God's laws; on the
contrary, they fulfil His laws; for they are the signs fol-
lowing Christianity, whereby matter is proven power-
less and subordinate to Mind. Christians, like students [30]
in mathematics, should be working up to those higher
rules of Life which Jesus taught and proved. Do we

[Page 30.]

really understand the divine Principle of Christianity [1]
before we prove it, in at least some feeble demonstra-
tion thereof, according to Jesus' example in healing the
sick? Should we adopt the "simple addition" in Chris-
tian Science and doubt its higher rules, or despair of [5]
ultimately reaching them, even though failing at first to
demonstrate all the possibilities of Christianity?

St. John spiritually discerned and revealed the sum
total of transcendentalism. He saw the real earth and
heaven. They were spiritual, not material; and they [10]
were without pain, sin, or death. Death was not the
door to this heaven. The gates thereof he declared were
inlaid with pearl,--likening them to the priceless under-
standing of man's real existence, to be recognized here
and now. [15]

The great Way-shower illustrated Life unconfined, un-
contaminated, untrammelled, by matter. He proved the
superiority of Mind over the flesh, opened the door to
the captive, and enabled man to demonstrate the law of
Life, which St. Paul declares "hath made me free from [20]
the law of sin and death."

The stale saying that Christian Science "is neither
Christian nor science!" is to-day the fossil of wisdom-
less wit, weakness, and superstition. "The fool hath
said in his heart, There is no God." [25]

Take courage, dear reader, for any seeming mysti-
cism surrounding realism is explained in the Scripture,
"There went up a mist from the earth [matter];" and
the mist of materialism will vanish as we approach spirit-
uality, the realm of reality; cleanse our lives in Christ's [30]
righteousness; bathe in the baptism of Spirit, and awake
in His likeness.





CHAPTER III. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.


[Page 31.]

_What do you consider to be mental malpractice? [1]_

Mental malpractice is a bland denial of Truth,
and is the antipode of Christian Science. To
mentally argue in a manner that can disastrously
affect the happiness of a fellow-being--harm him [5]
morally, physically, or spiritually--breaks the Golden
Rule and subverts the scientific laws of being. This,
therefore, is not the use but the abuse of mental treat-
ment, and is mental malpractice. It is needless to
say that such a subversion of right is not scientific. Its [10]
claim to power is in proportion to the faith in evil, and
consequently to the lack of faith in good. Such false
faith finds no place in, and receives no aid from, the
Principle or the rules of Christian Science; for it denies
the grand verity of this Science, namely, that God, good, [15]
has _all_ power.

This leaves the individual no alternative but to re-
linquish his faith in evil, or to argue against his own
convictions of good and so destroy his power to be or
to do good, because he has no faith in the _omnipotence_ [20]
of God, good. He parts with his understanding of good,
in order to retain his faith in evil and so succeed with his

[Page 32.]

wrong argument,--if indeed he desires success in this [1]
broad road to destruction.

_How shall we demean ourselves towards the students_
_of disloyal students? And what about that clergyman's_
_remarks on __"__Christ and Christmas__"__?_ [5]

From this question, I infer that some of my students
seem not to know in what manner they should act towards
the students of false teachers, or such as have strayed
from the rules and divine Principle of Christian Science.
The query is abnormal, when "precept upon precept; [10]
line upon line" are to be found in the Scriptures, and in
my books, on this very subject.

In Mark, ninth chapter, commencing at the thirty-
third verse, you will find my views on this subject; love
alone is admissible towards friend and foe. My sym- [15]
pathies extend to the above-named class of students more
than to many others. If I had the time to talk with all
students of Christian Science, and correspond with them,
I would gladly do my best towards helping those un-
fortunate seekers after Truth whose teacher is straying [20]
from the straight and narrow path. But I have not mo-
ments enough in which to give to my own flock all the
time and attention that they need,--and charity must
begin at home.

Distinct denominational and social organizations and [25]
societies are at present necessary for the individual,
and for our Cause. But all people can and should be
just, merciful; they should never envy, elbow, slander,
hate, or try to injure, but always should try to bless their
fellow-mortals. [30]

To the query in regard to some clergyman's com-

[Page 33.]

ments on my illustrated poem, I will say: It is the righteous [1]
prayer that avails with God. Whatever is wrong will
receive its own reward. The high priests of old caused
the crucifixion of even the great Master; and thereby
they lost, and he won, heaven. I love all ministers and [5]
ministries of Christ, Truth.

All clergymen may not understand the illustrations
in "Christ and Christmas;" or that these refer not to
personality, but present the type and shadow of Truth's
appearing in the womanhood as well as in the manhood [10]
of God, our divine Father and Mother.

_Must I have faith in Christian Science in order to be_
_healed by it?_

This is a question that is being asked every day. It
has not proved impossible to heal those who, when they [15]
began treatment, had no faith whatever in the Science,
--other than to place themselves under my care, and
follow the directions given. Patients naturally gain con-
fidence in Christian Science as they recognize the help
they derive therefrom. [20]

_What are the advantages of your system of healing, over_
_the ordinary methods of healing disease?_

Healing by Christian Science has the following advantages:--

_First_: It does away with all material medicines, and [25]
recognizes the fact that, as mortal mind is the cause of
all "the ills that flesh is heir to," the antidote for sickness,
as well as for sin, may and must be found in mortal mind's
opposite,--the divine Mind.

_Second_: It is more effectual than drugs; curing where [30]

[Page 34.]

these fail, and leaving none of the harmful "after effects" [1]
of these in the system; thus proving that metaphysics
is above physics.

_Third:_ One who has been healed by Christian Sci-
ence is not only healed of the disease, but is improved [5]
morally. The body is governed by mind; and mortal
mind must be improved, before the body is renewed
and harmonious,--since the physique is simply thought
made manifest.

_Is spiritualism or mesmerism included in Christian_ [10]
_Science?_

They are wholly apart from it. Christian Science is
based on divine Principle; whereas spiritualism, so far
as I understand it, is a mere speculative opinion and
human belief. If the departed were to communicate [15]
with us, we should see them as they were before death,
and have them with us; after death, they can no more
come to those they have left, than we, in our present state
of existence, can go to the departed or the adult can re-
turn to his boyhood. We may pass on to their state [20]
of existence, but they cannot return to ours. Man is
_im_-mortal, and there is not a moment when he ceases to
exist. All that are called "communications from spirits,"
lie within the realm of mortal thought on this present plane
of existence, and are the antipodes of Christian Science; [25]
the immortal and mortal are as direct opposites as light
and darkness.

_Who is the Founder of mental healing?_

The author of "Science and Health with Key to the
Scriptures," who discovered the Science of healing em- [30]

[Page 35.]

bodied in her works. Years of practical proof, through [1]
homoeopathy, revealed to her the fact that Mind, in-
stead of matter, is the Principle of pathology; and
subsequently her recovery, through the supremacy of
Mind over matter, from a severe casualty pronounced [5]
by the physicians incurable, sealed that proof with the
signet of Christian Science. In 1883, a million of peo-
ple acknowledge and attest the blessings of this mental
system of treating disease. Perhaps the following
words of her husband, the late Dr. Asa G. Eddy, [10]
afford the most concise, yet complete, summary of the
matter:--

"Mrs, Eddy's works are the outgrowths of her life.
I never knew so unselfish an individual."

_Will the book Science and Health, that you offer for sale_ [15]
_at three dollars, teach its readers to heal the sick,--or is_
_one obliged to become a student under your personal in-_
_struction? And if one is obliged to study under you, of_
_what benefit is your book?_

Why do we read the Bible, and then go to church to [20]
hear it expounded? Only because both are important.
Why do we read moral science, and then study it at
college?

You are benefited by reading Science and Health, but
it is greatly to your advantage to be taught its Science [25]
by the author of that work, who explains it in detail.

_What is immortal Mind?_

In reply, we refer you to "Science and Health with
Key to the Scriptures,"(2) Vol. I. page 14: "That which

[Page 36.]

is erring, sinful, sick, and dying, termed material or [1]
mortal man, is neither God's man nor Mind; but to be
understood, we shall classify evil and error as mortal
mind, in contradistinction to good and Truth, or the
Mind which is immortal." [5]

_Do animals and beasts have a mind?_

Beasts, as well as men, express Mind as their origin;
but they manifest less of Mind. The first and only
cause is the eternal Mind, which is God, and there is
but one God. The ferocious mind seen in the beast is [10]
mortal mind, which is harmful and proceeds not from
God; for His beast is the lion that lieth down with
the lamb. Appetites, passions, anger, revenge, subtlety,
are the animal qualities of sinning mortals; and the
beasts that have these propensities express the lower [15]
qualities of the so-called animal man; in other words,
the nature and quality of mortal mind,--not immortal
Mind.

_What is the distinction between mortal mind and immortal_
_Mind?_ [20]

Mortal mind includes all evil, disease, and death;
also, all beliefs relative to the so-called material laws,
and all material objects, and the law of sin and death.

The Scripture says, "The carnal mind [in other words,
mortal mind] is enmity against God; for it is not sub- [25]
ject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." Mortal
mind is an illusion; as much in our waking moments
as in the dreams of sleep. The belief that intelligence,
Truth, and Love, are in matter and separate from God,
is an error; for there is no intelligent evil, and no power [30]

[Page 37.]

besides God, good. God would not be omnipotent if [1]
there were in reality another mind creating or governing
man or the universe.

Immortal Mind is God; and this Mind is made
manifest in all thoughts and desires that draw man- [5]
kind toward purity, health, holiness, and the spiritual
facts of being.

Jesus recognized this relation so clearly that he said,
"I and my Father are one." In proportion as we oppose
the belief in material sense, in sickness, sin, and death, [10]
and recognize ourselves under the control of God,
spiritual and immortal Mind, shall we go on to leave the
animal for the spiritual, and learn the meaning of those
words of Jesus, "Go ye into all the world ... heal the
sick." [15]

_Can your Science cure intemperance?_

Christian Science lays the axe at the root of the tree.
Its antidote for all ills is God, the perfect Mind, which
corrects mortal thought, whence cometh all evil. God
can and does destroy the thought that leads to moral [20]
or physical death. Intemperance, impurity, sin of every
sort, is destroyed by Truth. The appetite for alcohol
yields to Science as directly and surely as do sickness
and sin.

_Does Mrs. Eddy take patients?_ [25]

She now does not. Her time is wholly devoted to in-
struction, leaving to her students the work of healing;
which, at this hour, is in reality the least difficult of the
labor that Christian Science demands.

[Page 38.]

_Why do you charge for teaching Christian Science, when_ [1]
_all the good we can do must be done freely?_

When teaching imparts the ability to gain and main-
tain health, to heal and elevate man in every line of
life,--as this teaching certainly does,--is it un- [5]
reasonable to expect in return something to support
one's self and a Cause? If so, our whole system
of education, secular and religious, is at fault, and the
instructors and philanthropists in our land should ex-
pect no compensation. "If we have sown unto you [10]
spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your
carnal things?"

_How happened you to establish a college to instruct in_
_metaphysics, when other institutions find little interest in_
_such a dry and abstract subject?_ [15]

Metaphysics, as taught by me at the Massachusetts
Metaphysical College, is far from dry and abstract. It
is a Science that has the animus of Truth. Its practical
application to benefit the race, heal the sick, enlighten
and reform the sinner, makes divine metaphysics need- [20]
ful, indispensable. Teaching metaphysics at other col-
leges means, mainly, elaborating a man-made theory,
or some speculative view too vapory and hypothetical
for questions of practical import.

_Is it necessary to study your Science in order to be healed_ [25]
_by it and keep well?_

It is not necessary to make each patient a student
in order to cure his present disease, if this is what
you mean. Were it so, the Science would be of less

[Page 39.]

practical value. Many who apply for help are not [1]
prepared to take a course of instruction in Christian
Science.

To avoid being _subject_ to disease, would require the
understanding of how you are healed. In 1885, this [5]
knowledge can be obtained in its genuineness at the
Massachusetts Metaphysical College. There are abroad
at this early date some grossly incorrect and false
teachers of what they term Christian Science; of such
beware. They have risen up in a day to make this claim; [10]
whereas the Founder of genuine Christian Science has
been all her years in giving it birth.

_Can you take care of yourself?_

God giveth to every one this _puissance_; and I have
faith in His promise, "Lo, I am with you alway"-- [15]
_all the way_. Unlike the M. D.'s, Christian Scientists
are not afraid to take their own medicine, for this
medicine is divine Mind; and from this saving, ex-
haustless source they intend to fill the human mind with
enough of the leaven of Truth to leaven the whole lump. [20]
There may be exceptional cases, where one Christian
Scientist who has more to meet than others needs support
at times; then, it is right to bear "one another's burdens,
and so fulfil the law of Christ."

_In what way is a Christian Scientist an instrument by_ [25]
_which God reaches others to heal them, and what most_
_obstructs the way?_

A Christian, or a Christian Scientist, assumes no more
when claiming to work with God in healing the sick,
than in converting the sinner. Divine help is as neces-

[Page 40.]
