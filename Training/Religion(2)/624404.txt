the last meeting, in the death of their excellent First Directress, Mrs.
Sarah Parkman, the last who remained at the Board, of its original
members, and for the last fourteen years its presiding Officer. That
they hold in affectionate remembrance her gentleness, her charity, her
thoughtfulness for others, her constant endeavor to do good; and it may
be permitted to add,--for it was a conspicuous trait in her
character,--the sincerity of heart with which, in all her varied
intercourse, she followed the apostolic injunction, "be courteous."

Also, that they acknowledge with much gratitude to her, and to the
children by whom her wishes were so promptly fulfilled, the receipt of
Five Hundred Dollars, the last testimony of her interest in an
Institution, which, from its foundation, has owed so much to her labors,
her counsels, and the liberality, which even in death, did not fail.
