our common Cause,--and their constant petitions for
the same, should be met in the most effectual way.

To be responsible for supplying this want, and poise [20]
the wavering balance on the right side, is impracticable
without a full knowledge of the environments. The
educational system of Christian Science lacks the aid
and protection of State laws. The Science is hampered
by immature demonstrations, by the infancy of its dis- [25]
covery, by incorrect teaching; and especially by unprin-
cipled claimants, whose mad ambition drives them to
appropriate my ideas and discovery, without credit, ap-
preciation, or a single original conception, while they

[Page 264.]

quote from other authors and give them credit for every [1]
random thought in line with mine.

My noble students, who are loyal to Christ, Truth, and
human obligations, will not be disheartened in the midst
of this seething sea of sin. They build for time and eter- [5]
nity. The others stumble over misdeeds, and their own
unsubstantiality, without the groundwork of right, till,
like camera shadows thrown upon the mists of time, they
melt into darkness.

Unity is the essential nature of Christian Science. Its [10]
Principle is One, and to demonstrate the divine One,
demands oneness of thought and action.

Many students enter the Normal class of my College
whom I have not fitted for it by the Primary course.
They are taught their first lessons by my students; hence [15]
the aptness to assimilate pure and abstract Science is
somewhat untested.

"As the twig is bent, the tree's inclined." As mortal
mind is directed, it acts for a season. Some students
leave my instructions before they are quite free from [20]
the bias of their first impressions, whether those be cor-
rect or incorrect. Such students are more or less subject
to the future mental influence of their former teacher.
Their knowledge of Mind-healing may be right theo-
retically, but the moral and spiritual status of thought [25]
must be right also. The tone of the teacher's mind must
be pure, grand, true, to aid the mental development of
the student; for the tint of the instructor's mind must
take its hue from the divine Mind. A single mistake in
metaphysics, or in ethics, is more fatal than a mistake in [30]
physics.

If a teacher of Christian Science unwittingly or inten-

[Page 265.]

tionally offers his own thought, and gives me as authority [1]
for it; if he diverges from Science and knows it not, or,
knowing it, makes the venture from vanity, in order to
be thought original, or wiser than somebody else,--this
divergence widens. He grows dark, and cannot regain, [5]
at will, an upright understanding. This error in the
teacher also predisposes his students to make mistakes
and lose their way. Diverse opinions in Science are
stultifying. All must have _one_ Principle and the same
rule; and all _who follow the Principle and rule_ have but [10]
one opinion of it.

Whosoever understands a single rule in Science, and
demonstrates its Principle according to rule, is master
of the situation. Nobody can gainsay this. The ego-
tistical theorist or shallow moralist may presume to [15]
make innovations upon simple proof; but his mistake
is visited upon himself and his students, whose minds
are, must be, disturbed by this discord, which extends
along the whole line of reciprocal thought. An error
in premise can never bring forth the real fruits of Truth. [20]
After thoroughly explaining spiritual Truth and its ethics
to a student, I am not morally responsible for the mis-
statements or misconduct of this student. My teachings
are uniform. Those who abide by them do well. If
others, who receive the same instruction, do ill, the fault [25]
is not in the culture but the soil.

I am constantly called to settle questions and disaf-
fections toward Christian Science growing out of the
departures from Science of self-satisfied, unprincipled
students. If impatient of the loving rebuke, the stu- [30]
dent must stop at the foot of the grand ascent, and there
remain until suffering compels the downfall of his self-

[Page 266.]

conceit. Then that student must struggle up, with bleed- [1]
ing footprints, to the God-crowned summit of unselfish
and pure aims and affections.

To be two-sided, when these sides are moral oppo-
sites, is neither politic nor scientific; and to abridge a [5]
single human right or privilege is an error. Whoever
does this may represent me as doing it; but he mistakes
me, and the subjective state of his own mind for mine.

The true leader of a true cause is the unacknowledged
servant of mankind. Stationary in the background, this [10]
individual is doing the work that nobody else can or will
do. An erratic career is like the comet's course, dash-
ing through space, headlong and alone. A clear-headed
and honest Christian Scientist will demonstrate the Prin-
ciple of Christian Science, and hold justice and mercy as [15]
inseparable from the unity of God.




Unchristian Rumor


The assertion that I have said hard things about my
loyal students in Chicago, New York, or any other place,
is utterly false and groundless. I speak of them as I feel, [20]
and I cannot find it in my heart not to love them. They
are essentially dear to me, who are toiling and achieving
success in unison with my own endeavors and prayers.
If I correct mistakes which may be made in teaching or
lecturing on Christian Science, this is in accordance with [25]
my students' desires, and thus we mutually aid each other,
and obey the Golden Rule.

The spirit of lies is abroad. Because Truth has spoken
aloud, error, running to and fro in the earth, is scream-

[Page 267.]

ing, to make itself heard above Truth's voice. The [1]
audible and inaudible wail of evil never harms Scientists,
steadfast in their consciousness of the nothingness of
wrong and the supremacy of right.

Our worst enemies are the best friends to our growth. [5]
Charity students, for whom I have sacrificed the most
time,--those whose chief aim is to injure me,--have
caused me to exercise most patience. When they report
me as "_hating_ those whom I do not love," let them re-
member that there never was a time when I saw an op- [10]
portunity really to help them and failed to improve it;
and this, too, when I knew they were secretly striving
to injure me.




Vainglory


_Comparisons are odorous._--SHAKESPEARE

Through all human history, the vital outcomes of [16]
Truth have suffered temporary shame and loss from
individual conceit, cowardice, or dishonesty. The bird
whose right wing flutters to soar, while the left beats its
way downward, falls to the earth. Both wings must be [20]
plumed for rarefied atmospheres and upward flight.

Mankind must gravitate from sense to Soul, and human
affairs should be governed by Spirit, intelligent good.
The antipode of Spirit, which we name _matter_, or _non-_
_intelligent evil_, is no real aid to being. The predisposing [25]
and exciting cause of all defeat and victory under the
sun, rests on this scientific basis: that action, in obedi-
ence to God, spiritualizes man's motives and methods,
and crowns them with success; while disobedience to

[Page 268.]

this divine Principle materializes human modes and con- [1]
sciousness, and defeats them.

Two personal queries give point to human action: Who
shall be greatest? and, Who shall be best? Earthly
glory is vain; but not vain enough to attempt pointing [5]
the way to heaven, the harmony of being. The imaginary
victories of rivalry and hypocrisy are defeats. The Holy
One saith, "O that thou hadst hearkened to My com-
mandments! then had thy peace been as a river." He
is unfit for Truth, and the demonstration of divine power, [10]
who departs from Mind to matter, and from Truth to
error, in pursuit of better means for healing the sick and
casting out error.

The Christian Scientist keeps straight to the course.
His whole inquiry and demonstration lie in the line of [15]
Truth; hence he suffers no shipwreck in a starless night
on the shoals of vainglory. His medicine is Mind--
the omnipotent and ever-present good. His "help is
from the Lord," who heals body and mind, head and
heart; changing the affections, enlightening the mis- [20]
guided senses, and curing alike the sin and the mortal
sinner. God's preparations for the sick are potions of
His own qualities. His therapeutics are antidotes for
the ailments of mortal mind and body. Then let us not
adulterate His preparations for the sick with material [25]
means.

From lack of moral strength empires fall. Right alone
is irresistible, permanent, eternal. Remember that hu-
man pride forfeits spiritual power, and either vacillating
good or self-assertive error dies of its own elements. [30]
Through patience we must possess the sense of Truth;
and Truth is used to waiting. "Commit thy way unto

[Page 269.]

the Lord; trust also in Him; and He shall bring it to [1]
pass."

By using falsehood to regain his liberty, Galileo vir-
tually lost it. He cannot escape from barriers who commits
his moral sense to a dungeon. Hear the Master [5]
on this subject: "No man can serve two masters: for
either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he
will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot
serve God and mammon."

Lives there a man who can better define ethics, better [10]
elucidate the Principle of being, than he who "spake as
never man spake," and whose precepts and example have
a perpetual freshness in relation to human events?

Who is it that understands, unmistakably, a fraction
of the actual Science of Mind-healing? [15]

It is he who has fairly proven his knowledge on a Chris-
tian, mental, scientific basis; who has made his choice
between matter and Mind, and proven the divine Mind
to be the only physician. These are self-evident proposi-
tions: That man can only be Christianized through Mind; [20]
that without Mind the body is without action; that Science
is a law of divine Mind. The conclusion follows that the
correct Mind-healing is the proper means of Christianity,
and is Science.

Christian Science may be sold in the shambles. Many [25]
are bidding for it,--but are not willing to pay the price.
Error is vending itself on trust, well knowing the will-
ingness of mortals to buy error at par value. The Reve-
lator beheld the opening of this silent mental seal, and
heard the great Red Dragon _whispering_ that "no man [30]
might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name
of the beast, or the number of his name."

[Page 270.]

We are in the Valley of Decision. Then, let us take [1]
the side of him who "overthrew the tables of the money-
changers, and the seats of them that sold doves,"--of
such as barter integrity and peace for money and fame.
What artist would question the skill of the masters in [5]
sculpture, music, or painting? Shall we depart from the
example of the Master in Christian Science, Jesus of
Nazareth,--than whom mankind hath no higher ideal?
He who demonstrated his power over sin, disease, and
death, is the master Metaphysician. [10]

To seek or employ other means than those the Master
used in demonstrating Life scientifically, is to lose the
priceless knowledge of his Principle and practice. He
said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His right-
eousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." [15]
Gain a pure Christianity; for that is requisite for heal-
ing the sick. Then you will need no other aid, and will
have full faith in his prophecy, "And there shall be one
fold, and one shepherd;" but, the Word must abide in
us, if we would obtain that promise. We cannot depart [20]
from his holy example,--we cannot leave Christ for the
schools which crucify him, and yet follow him in heal-
ing. Fidelity to his precepts and practice is the only pass-
port to his power; and the pathway of goodness and
greatness runs through the modes and methods of God. [25]

"He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."




Compounds


Homoeopathy is the last link in material medicine.
The next step is Mind-medicine. Among the foremost

[Page 271.]

virtues of homoeopathy is the exclusion of compounds [1]
from its pharmacy, and the attenuation of a drug up to
the point of its disappearance as matter and its manifesta-
tion in effect as a thought, instead of a thing.

Students of Christian Science (and many who are not [1]
students) understand enough of this to keep out of their
heads the notion that compounded metaphysics (so-called)
is, or can be, Christian Science,--that rests on oneness;
one cause and one effect.

They should take our magazine, work for it, write for [10]
it, and read it. They should eschew all magazines and
books which are less than the best.

"Choose you this day whom ye will serve." Cleanse
your mind of the cobwebs which spurious "compounds"
engender. Before considering a subject that is unworthy [15]
of thought, take in this axiomatic truism: "Trust her
not, she's fooling thee;" and Longfellow is right.




Close Of The Massachusetts Metaphysical College


Much is said at this date, 1889, about Mrs. Eddy's [20]
Massachusetts Metaphysical College being the only
chartered College of Metaphysics. To make this plain,
the Publishing Committee of the Christian Scientist
Association has published in the _Boston Traveler_ the
following:-- [25]

"To benefit the community, and more strongly mark
the difference between true and false teachers of mental
healing, the following history and statistics are officially
submitted:--

[Page 272.]

"Rev. Mary Baker G. Eddy obtained a college charter [1]
in January, 1881, with all the rights and privileges per-
taining thereunto (_including the right to grant degrees_)
under Act of 1874, Chapter 375, Section 4.

"This Act was _repealed_ from and after January 31, [5]
1882. Mrs. Eddy's grant for a college, for metaphysical
purposes _only_, is the first on record in history, and no
charters were granted for similar colleges, except hers,
from January, 1881, till the repealing of said Act in
January, 1882. [10]

"The substance of this Act is at present incorporated
in Public Statutes, Chapter 115, Section 2, with the fol-
lowing important restrictions: In accordance with Statutes
of 1883, Chapter 268, any officer, agent, or servant of any
corporation or association, who confers, or authorizes [15]
to be conferred, any diploma or degree, shall be pun-
ished by a fine not less than five hundred dollars and
not more than one thousand dollars.

"All the mind-healing colleges (except Rev. Mrs.
Eddy's) have simply an incorporated grant, which may [20]
be called a charter, such as any stock company may ob-
tain for any secular purposes; but these so-called char-
ters bestow no rights to _confer degrees_. Hence to name
these institutions, under such charters, _colleges_, is a fraud-
ulent claim. There is but one legally chartered college [25]
of metaphysics, with powers to confer diplomas and de-
grees, and that is the Massachusetts Metaphysical College,
of which Rev. Mrs. Eddy is founder and president."

I have endeavored to act toward all students of Chris-
tian Science with the intuition and impulse of love. If [30]
certain natures have not profited by my rebukes,--

[Page 273.]

some time, as Christian Scientists, they will know the [1]
value of these rebukes. I am thankful that the neo-
phyte will be benefited by experience, although it will
cost him much, and in proportion to its worth.

I close my College in order to work in other directions, [5]
where I now seem to be most needed, and where none
other can do the work. I withdraw from an overwhelm-
ing prosperity. My students have never expressed so
grateful a sense of my labors with them as now, and
never have been so capable of relieving my tasks as at [10]
present.

God bless my enemies, as well as the better part of
mankind, and gather all my students, in the bonds of
love and perfectness, into one grand family of Christ's
followers. [15]

Loyal Christian Scientists should go on in their pres-
ent line of labor for a good and holy cause. Their insti-
tutes have not yet accomplished all the good they are
capable of accomplishing; therefore they should con-
tinue, as at present, to send out students from these [20]
sources of education, to promote the growing interest in
Christian Science Mind-healing.

There are one hundred and sixty applications lying on
the desk before me, for the Primary class in the Massa-
chusetts Metaphysical College, and I cannot do my best [25]
work for a class which contains that number. When
these were taught, another and a larger number would
be in waiting for the same class instruction; and if I
should teach that Primary class, the other three classes--
one Primary and two Normal--would be delayed. [30]
The work is more than one person can well accomplish,
and the imperative call is for my exclusive teaching.

[Page 274.]

From the scant history of Jesus and of his disciples, [1]
we have no Biblical authority for a public institution.
This point, however, had not impressed me when I opened
my College. I desire to revise my book "Science and
Health with Key to the Scriptures," and in order to do [5]
this I must stop teaching at present. The work that
needs to be done, and which God calls me to outside
of College work, if left undone might hinder the progress
of our Cause more than my teaching would advance it:
therefore I leave all for Christ. [10]

Deeply regretting the disappointment this will occa-
sion, and with grateful acknowledgments to the public
for its liberal patronage, I close my College.

Malicious Reports


_Truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter._--ISAIAH lix. 14.

When the press is gagged, liberty is besieged; but
when the press assumes the liberty to lie, it discounts
clemency, mocks morality, outrages humanity, breaks
common law, gives impulse to violence, envy, and hate, [20]
and prolongs the reign of inordinate, unprincipled clans.
At this period, 1888, those quill-drivers whose consciences
are in their pockets hold high carnival. When news-
dealers shout for class legislation, and decapitated reputa-
tions, headless trunks, and quivering hearts are held up [25]
before the rabble in exchange for money, place, and
power, the _vox populi_ is suffocated, individual rights
are trodden under foot, and the car of the modern In-
quisition rolls along the streets besmeared with blood.

[Page 275.]

Would not our Master say to the chief actors in scenes [1]
like these, "Ye fools and blind!" Oh, tardy human
justice! would you take away even woman's trembling,
clinging faith in divine power? Who can roll away the
stone from the door of this sepulchre? Who--but God's [5]
avenging angel!

In times like these it were well to lift the veil on the
sackcloth of home, where weepeth the faithful, stricken
mother, and the bruised father bendeth his aching head;
where the bereft wife or husband, silent and alone, looks [10]
in dull despair at the vacant seat, and the motherless
little ones, wondering, huddle together, and repeat with
quivering lips words of strange import. May the great
Shepherd that "tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,"
and binds up the wounds of bleeding hearts, just comfort, [15]
encourage, and bless all who mourn.

Father, we thank Thee that Thy light and Thy love
reach earth, open the prison to them that are bound, con-
sole the innocent, and throw wide the gates of heaven.




Loyal Christian Scientists


Pen can never portray the satisfaction that you afforded
me at the grand meeting in Chicago of the National Chris-
tian Scientist Association in 1888. Your public and
private expressions of love and loyalty were very touch-
ing. They moved me to speechless thanks. [25]

Chicago is the wonder of the western hemisphere. The
Palmer House, where we stopped, is magnificent and
orderly. The servants are well-mannered, and the fare
is appetizing. The floral offerings sent to my apartments

[Page 276.]

were superb, especially the large book of rare flowers, and [1]
the crescent with a star.

The reception in the spacious rooms of the Palmer
House, like all else, was purely Western in its cordiality
and largeness. I did not hold interviews with all with [5]
whom I desired to, solely because so many people and
circumstances demanded my attention that my person-
ality was not big enough to fill the order; but rest as-
sured my heart's desire met the demand.

My students, our delegates, about one thousand Chris- [10]
tian Scientists, active, earnest, and loyal, formed a goodly
assemblage for the third convention of our National As-
sociation,--an assemblage found waiting and watching
for the full coming of our Lord and Christ.

In Christian Science the midnight hour will always be [15]
the bridal hour, until "no night is there." The wise
will have their lamps aglow, and light will illumine the
darkness.

Out of the gloom comes the glory of our Lord, and
His divine Love is found in affliction. When a false [20]
sense suffers, the true sense comes out, and the bride-
groom appears. We are then wedded to a purer, higher
affection and ideal.

I pray that all my students shall have their lamps
trimmed and burning at the noon of night, that not one [25]
of them be found borrowing oil, and seeking light from
matter instead of Spirit, or at work erroneously, thus
shutting out spiritual light. Such an error and loss will
be quickly learned when the door is shut. Error giveth
no light, and it closes the door on itself. [30]

In the dark hours, wise Christian Scientists stand
firmer than ever in their allegiance to God. Wisdom

[Page 277.]

is wedded to their love, and their hearts are not [1]
troubled.

Falsehood is on the wings of the winds, but Truth
will soar above it. Truth is speaking louder, clearer,
and more imperatively than ever. Error is walking to [5]
and fro in the earth, trying to be heard above Truth,
but its voice dies out in the distance. Whosoever pro-
claims Truth loudest, becomes the mark for error's shafts.
The archers aim at Truth's mouthpiece; but a heart
loyal to God is patient and strong. Justice waits, and [10]
is used to waiting; and right wins the everlasting
victory.

The stake and scaffold have never silenced the mes-
sages of the Most High. Then can the present mode of
attempting this--namely, by slanderous falsehoods, and [15]
a secret mind-method, through which to effect the pur-
poses of envy and malice--silence Truth? Never. They
but open the eyes to the truth of Benjamin Franklin's
report before the French Commissioners on Mesmerism:
"It is one more fact to be recorded in the history of the [20]
errors of the human mind."

"The Lord reigneth; let the earth rejoice."

No evidence before the material senses can close my
eyes to the scientific proof that God, good, is supreme.
Though clouds are round about Him, the divine justice [25]
and judgment are enthroned. Love is especially near
in times of hate, and never so near as when one can be
just amid lawlessness, and render good for evil.

I thunder His law to the sinner, and sharply lighten
on the cloud of the intoxicated senses. I cannot help [30]
loathing the phenomena of drunkenness produced by
animality. I rebuke it wherever I see it. The vision

[Page 278.]

of the Revelator is before me. The wines of fornica- [1]
tion, envy, and hatred are the distilled spirits of evil,
and are the signs of these times; but I am not dismayed,
and my peace returns unto me.

Error will hate more as it realizes more the presence [5]
of its tormentor. I shall fulfil my mission, fight the good
fight, and keep the faith.

There is great joy in this consciousness, that through-
out my labors, and in my history as connected with the
Cause of Christian Science, it can be proven that I have [10]
never given occasion for a single censure, when my mo-
tives and acts are understood and seen as my Father
seeth them. I once wondered at the Scriptural declara-
tion that Job sinned not in all he said, even when he cursed
the hour of his birth; but I have learned that a curse on [15]
sin is always a blessing to the human race.

Those only who are tried in the furnace reflect the
image of their Father. You, my beloved students, who
are absent from me, and have shared less of my labors
than many others, seem stronger to resist temptation [20]
than some of those who have had line upon line and
precept upon precept. This may be a serviceable hint,
since necessities and God's providence are foreshadowed.
I have felt for some time that perpetual instruction of
my students might substitute my own for their growth, [25]
and so dwarf their experience. If they must learn by
the things they suffer, the sooner this lesson is gained
the better.

For two years I have been gradually withdrawing from
active membership in the Christian Scientist Association. [30]
This has developed higher energies on the part of true
followers, and led to some startling departures on the

[Page 279.]

other hand. "Offenses will come: but woe unto him, [1]
through whom they come."

Why does not the certainty of individual punishment
