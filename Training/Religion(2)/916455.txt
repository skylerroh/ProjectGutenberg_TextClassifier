  Shall loud hosannas raise;
My heart shall glow with gratitude,
  My lips be filled with praise.

_The Reign of Sin._     (407)

How heavy is the night
  That hangs upon our eyes,
Till Christ with his reviving light
  Over our souls arise.

2 Our guilty spirits dread
  To meet the wrath of heaven;
But, in his righteousness arrayed,
  We see our sins forgiven.

3 The powers of hell agree
  To hold our souls in vain;
He sets the sons of bondage free,
  And breaks the cursed chain.

4 Lord, we adore thy ways
  To bring us near to God,
Thy sovereign power, thy healing grace,
  And thine atoning blood.

     Isaac Watts, 1709.


181     Downs. C.M.

_The Need of Regeneration._     (396)

How helpless guilty nature lies,
  Unconscious of its load!
The heart, unchanged, can never rise
  To happiness and God.

2 Can aught, beneath a power divine,
  The stubborn will subdue?
'Tis thine, almighty Spirit! thine,
  To form the heart anew.

3 'Tis thine, the passions to recall,
  And upward bid them rise;
To make the scales of error fall,
  From reason's darkened eyes.

4 Oh! change these wretched hearts of ours,
  And give them life divine;
Then shall our passions and our powers,
  Almighty Lord! be thine.

     Anne Steele, 1760.


182     Downs. C.M.

_Pardon and Sanctification in Christ._     (397)

How sad our state by nature is!
  Our sin--how deep it stains!
And Satan binds our captive minds,
  Fast in his slavish chains.

2 But there's a voice of sovereign grace
  Sounds from the sacred word;--
"Ho! ye despairing sinners! come
  And trust a faithful Lord."

3 My soul obeys the gracious call
  And runs to this relief;
I would believe thy promise, Lord!
  Oh! help my unbelief.

4 To the blest fountain of thy blood,
  Incarnate God! I fly;
Here let me wash my spotted soul,
  From crimes of deepest dye.

5 A guilty, weak, and helpless worm,
  On thy kind arms I fall;
Be thou my strength and righteousness
  My Jesus, and my all.

     Isaac Watts, 1707.


183     Downs. C.M.

_Man's Need of the New Birth._     (400)

Sinners, this solemn truth regard,
  Hear, all ye sons of men;
For Christ, the Savior, hath declared,
  "Ye must be born again."

2 Whate'er might be your birth or blood,
  The sinner's boast is vain;
Thus saith the glorious Son of God,
  "Ye must be born again."

3 That which is born of flesh is flesh,
  And flesh it will remain:
Then marvel not that Jesus saith,
  "Ye must be born again."

4 Spirit of life, thy grace impart,
  And breathe on sinners slain:
Bear witness, Lord, in ev'ry heart,
  That we are born again.

_Man's Need of Christ._     (402)

Buried in shadows of the night
We lie, till Christ restores the light;
Till he descends to heal the blind,
And chase the darkness of the mind.

2 Our guilty souls are drowned in tears,
Till his atoning blood appears;
Then we awake from deep distress,
And sing the Lord our righteousness.

3 Jesus beholds where Satan reigns,
And binds his slaves in heavy chains;
He sets the prisoners free, and breaks
The iron bondage from our necks.

4 Poor, helpless worms in thee possess
Grace, wisdom, power, and righteousness
Thou art our mighty all, and we
Give our whole selves, O Lord, to thee.

     Isaac Watts, 1709.


185     Melody. C.M.

_Law and Grace._     (399)

Vain are the hopes, the sons of men
  On their own works have built;
Their hearts by nature all unclean,
  And all their actions, guilt.

2 Let Jew and Gentile stop their mouths,
  Without a murm'ring word;
And the whole race of Adam stand
  Guilty before the Lord.

3 In vain we ask God's righteous law
  To justify us now,
Since to convince, and to condemn,
  Is all the law can do.

4 Jesus! how glorious is thy grace!
  When in thy name we trust,
Our faith receives a righteousness,
  That makes the sinner just.

     Isaac Watts, 1709.


186     Glorious Fountain. C.M.

_Glorious Fountain._     (407)

There is a fountain filled with blood,
  Drawn from Immanuel's veins,
And sinners plunged beneath that flood,
  Lose all their guilty stains.

Cho.--Oh, glorious fountain!
        Here will I stay,
      And in thee ever
        Wash my sins away.

2 The dying thief rejoiced to see,
  That fountain in his day,
And there may I, though vile as he,
  Wash all my sins away.

3 Thou dying Lamb, thy precious blood,
  Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed church of God,
  Are saved to sin no more.

4 E'er since by faith I saw the stream
  Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
  And shall be till I die.

5 And when this feeble, faltering tongue
  Lies silent in the grave,
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
  I'll sing thy power to save.

     William Cowper, 1779.

187     Siloam. C.M.

_The All-Sufficient Grace._    (488)

When wounded sore, the stricken soul
  Lies bleeding and unbound:
One hand alone, a pierced hand,
  Can heal the sinner's wound.

2 When sorrow swells the laden breast,
  And tears of anguish flow,
One heart alone, a broken heart,
  Can feel the sinner's woe.

3 'Tis Jesus' blood that washes white,
  His hand, that brings relief;
His heart, that's touched with all our joys,
  And feeleth for our grief.

4 Lift up thy bleeding hand, O Lord!
  Unseal that cleansing tide;
We have no shelter from our sin,
  But in thy wounded side.

     Mrs. Cecil F. Alexander, 1858.

_Salvation._

Salvation! oh, the joyful sound!
  What pleasure to our ears;
A sovereign balm for every wound,
  A cordial for our fears.

2 Salvation! let the echo fly
  The spacious earth around,
While all the armies of the sky
  Conspire to raise the sound.

3 Salvation! O thou bleeding Lamb!
  To Thee the praise belongs:
Salvation shall inspire our hearts,
  And dwell upon our tongues.

     Isaac Watts.

189     Dunbar. S.M.

_All Invited._     (446)

How, vast, how full, how free,
  The mercy of our God!
Proclaim the blessed news around,
  And spread it all abroad.

Cho.--I'm glad salvation's free!
      I'm glad salvation's free!
      Salvation's free for you and me,
      I'm glad salvation's free!

2 How vast! "whoever will"
  May drink at mercy's stream,
And know that faith in Jesus brings
  Salvation now to him.

3 How full! it doth remove
  The stain of every sin;
And makes the soul as white and pure,
  As though no sin had been.

4 Poor trembling sinner, come!
  God waits to comfort thee,
Come, cast thyself upon his love,
  So vast, so full, so free.

     Vestry H. & T. Book.


190     Boylston. S.M.

_The Better Sacrifice._     (297)

Not all the blood of beasts,
  On Jewish altars slain,
Could give the guilty conscience peace,
  Or wash away the stain.

2 But Christ, the heavenly Lamb,
  Takes all our sins away;
A sacrifice of nobler name,
  And richer blood than they.

3 My faith would lay her hand
  On that dear head of Thine,
While like a penitent I stand,
  And there confess my sin.

4 My soul looks back to see
  The burden thou didst bear;
While hanging on the cursed tree,
  And knows her guilt was there.

     Isaac Watts


191     Jesus Saves. P.M.

_Atonement for All._

We have heard the joyful sound,
  Jesus saves, Jesus saves!
Spread the tidings all around,
  Jesus saves, Jesus saves!
Bear the news to ev'ry land,
  Climb the steeps and cross the waves;
Onward! 'tis our Lord's command;
  Jesus saves, Jesus saves!

2 Waft it on the rolling tide,
  Jesus saves, Jesus saves!
Tell to sinners far and wide,
  Jesus saves, Jesus saves!
Sing, ye islands of the sea,
  Echo back, ye ocean caves;
Earth shall keep her jubilee;
  Jesus saves, Jesus saves!

3 Sing above the battle strife,
  Jesus saves, Jesus saves!
By his death and endless life,
  Jesus saves, Jesus saves!
Sing it softly thro' the gloom,
  When the heart for mercy craves;
Sing in triumph o'er the tomb,
  Jesus saves, Jesus saves!

4 Give the winds a mighty voice,
  Jesus saves, Jesus saves!
Let the nations now rejoice,
  Jesus saves, Jesus saves!
Shout salvation full and free,
  Highest hills and deepest caves;
This our song of victory,
  Jesus saves, Jesus saves!

_Ark of Salvation._

Like Noah's weary dove
  That soared the earth around,
But not a resting place above
  The cheerless waters found,

2 Oh, cease, my wandering soul,
  On restless wing to roam;
All the wide world, to either pole,
  Has not for thee a home.

3 Behold the ark of God,
  Behold the open door;
Hasten to gain that dear abode,
  And rove, my soul, no more.

4 There safe thou shalt abide,
  There sweet shall be thy rest,
And every longing satisfied,
  With full salvation blessed.

_A Joyful Message._

Sinners Jesus will receive;
  Sound this word of grace to all
Who the heavenly pathway leave,
  All who linger, all who fall.

Ref.--Sing it o'er and o'er again;
     Christ receiveth sinful men,
     Make the message clear and plain:
     Christ receiveth sinful men.

2 Come, and he will give you rest;
  Trust him for his word is plain;
He will take the sinfulest;
  Christ receiveth sinful men.

3 Now my heart condemns me not,
  Pure before the law I stand;
He who cleansed me from all spot,
  Satisfied its last demand.

4 Christ receiveth sinful men,
  Even me with all my sin;
Purged from every spot and stain,
  Heaven with him I'll enter in.

194     Depth of Mercy. 7s.

_The Chief of Sinners_     (501)

Depth of mercy! can there be
Mercy still reserved for me?
Can my God his wrath forbear?
Me, the chief of sinners, spare?

Cho.--God is love; I know, I feel;
      Jesus weeps and loves me still;
      Jesus weeps and loves me still.

2 I have long withstood his grace,
Long provoked him to his face;
Would not hearken to his calls;
Grieved him by a thousand falls.

3 There for me the Savior stands;
Shows his wounds and spreads his hands;
God is love; I know, I feel;
Jesus weeps, and loves me still.

4 Now incline me to repent;
Let me now my fall lament;
Now my foul revolt deplore;
Weep, believe, and sin no more.

Blow ye the trumpet, blow!
  The gladly solemn sound,
Let all the nations know,
  To earth's remotest bound,
The year of jubilee is come,
Return, ye ransomed sinners, home.

2 Jesus, our great High Priest,
  Hath full atonement made:
Ye weary spirits! rest,
  Ye mournful souls! be glad;
The year of jubilee is come;
Return, ye ransomed sinners! home.

3 Extol the Lamb of God,--
  The all-atoning Lamb;
Redemption in his blood,
  Throughout the world, proclaim;
The year of jubilee is come;
Return, ye ransomed sinners! home.

4 Ye, who have sold for naught
  Your heritage above!
Shall have it back unbought,
  The gift of Jesus' love;
The year of jubilee is come;
Return, ye ransomed sinners! home.

_The Sacrifice._

Arise, my soul, arise,
  Shake off thy guilty fears;
The bleeding sacrifice
  In my behalf appears;
Before the throne my Surety stands,
My name is written on his hands.

2 He ever lives above,
  For me to intercede;
His all-redeeming love,
  His precious blood to plead;
His blood atoned for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.

3 Five bleeding wounds he bears,
  Received on Calvary;
They pour effectual prayers,
  They strongly speak for me;
Forgive him, O forgive, they cry,
Nor let that ransomed sinner die.

4 The Father hears him pray,
  His dear Anointed One;
He cannot turn away
  The presence of his Son;
His Spirit answers to the blood,
And tells me I am born of God.

5 My God is reconciled,
  His pard'ning voice I hear,
He owns me for his child,
  I can no longer fear;
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And Father, Abba, Father, cry.

_Jesus Paid It All._

I hear the Savior say,
  Thy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
  Find in me thine all in all.

Cho.--Jesus paid it all,
        All to him I owe;
      Sin had left a crimson stain,
        He washed it white as snow.

2 Lord, now indeed I find
  Thy power, and thine alone,
Can change the leper's spots,
  And melt the heart of stone.

3 For nothing good have I
  Whereby thy grace to claim--
I'll wash my garment white
  In the blood of Calvary's Lamb.

4 When from my dying bed
  My ransomed soul shall rise,
Then "Jesus paid it all"
  Shall rend the vaulted skies.

5 And when before the throne
  I stand in him complete,
I'll lay my trophies down,
  All down at Jesus' feet.

Come to the blood-stained tree;
  The Victim bleeding lies;
God sets the sinner free,
  Since Christ, a ransom, dies.

2 The Spirit will apply
  His blood to cleanse thy stain;
Oh, burdened soul, draw nigh,
  For none can come in vain!

3 Dark though thy guilt appear,
  And deep its crimson stain,
There's boundless mercy here,
  Oh, do not still disdain.

4 Look not within for peace,
  Within, there's nought to cheer;
Look up, and find release
  From sin, and self, and fear.
