  From whom salvation flows,
Who sent his Son, our souls to save
  From everlasting woes.

4 Lift up to God the voice of praise,
  For hope's transporting ray,
Which lights, through darkest shades of death,
  To realms of endless day.

_Adoration._

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
  Early in the morning our song shall rise to thee;
Holy, holy, holy! merciful and mighty!
  God over all and blest eternally.

2 Holy, holy, holy! all saints adore thee,
  Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
Cherubim and seraphim falling down before thee,
  Who wast, and art, and evermore shall be.

3 Holy, holy, holy! tho' the darkness hide thee,
  Though the eye of sinful man thy glory may not see;
Only thou art holy, there is none beside thee;
  Perfect in power, in love, and purity.

4 Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
  All thy works shall praise thy name in earth, and sky, and sea;
Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!
  God over all, and blest eternally.

Sing to the Lord Jehovah's name,

2 With thanks approach his awful sight,
  And psalms of honor sing;
The Lord's a God of boundless might--
  The whole creation's King.

3 Come, and with humble souls adore;
  Come, kneel before his face;
Oh, may the creatures of his power
  Be children of his grace.

4 Now is the time--he bends his ear,
  And waits for your request;
Come, lest he rouse his wrath, and swear,
  "Ye shall not see my rest."

And aid my tongue to bless his name,
  Whose favors are divine.

2 Oh, bless the Lord, my soul,
  Nor let his mercies lie
Forgotten in unthankfulness,
  And without praises die.

3 'Tis he forgives thy sins--
  'Tis he relieves thy pain--
'Tis he that heals thy sicknesses,
  And gives thee strength again.

4 He crowns thy life with love,
  When ransomed from the grave;
He who redeemed my soul from hell,
  Hath sovereign power to save.

Come, sound his praise abroad,
  And hymns of glory sing;
Jehovah is the sov'reign God,
  The universal king.

2 He formed the deeps unknown;
  He gave the seas their bound;
The watery worlds are all his own,
  And all the solid ground.

3 Come, worship at his throne;
  Come, bow before the Lord;
We are his works, and not our own;
  He formed us by his word.

4 To-day attend his voice,
  Nor dare provoke his rod;
Come, like the people of his choice,
  And own your gracious God.

     Isaac Watts, 1719.

  That Christ redeems from sin.

        That decks the sky above,
      But man alone can tell the pow'r
        Of Christ's redeeming love.

2 God's works reveal his might,
  His majesty and grace;
But not the tender Father's love
  That saves a dying race.

3 Then let the voice of praise
  To heavenly courts ascend,
Till with the songs the angels sing
  Our hallelujahs blend.

4 To him that hath redeemed
  Our souls from sin's dark maze;
The Hope and Savior of mankind,

  Above all blessing high,
Who would not fear his holy name,
  And laud and magnify?

3 Oh, for the living flame
  From his own altar brought,
To touch our lips, our minds inspire,
  And wing to heaven our thought!

  And his salvation ours;
Then be his love in Christ proclaimed,
  With all our ransomed powers.

2 Praise the Lord, for he hath spoken;
  Worlds his mighty voice obeyed;
Laws, which never shall be broken,
  For their guidance he hath made.

  Never shall his promise fail;
God hath made his saints victorious;
  Sin and death shall not prevail.

  To eternity endure.

  Gathered out of every land;
As the people of his choice,
  Plucked from the destroyer's hand.

3 Praise him, ye who know his love;
  Praise him from the depths beneath;
Praise him in the heights above;
  Praise your Maker all that breathe.

4 For his truth and mercy stand,
  Past, and present, and to be,
Like the years of his right hand--
  Like his own eternity.

     James Montgomery, 1822.

      Praise ye the Lord! sing Hallelujah!
      Praise ye the Lord! sing Hallelujah!
      Praise ye the Lord!

2 Hallelujah! Church victorious,
  Thou mayst lift this joyful strain;
Hallelujah! songs of triumph,
  Well befit the ransomed train.

3 Hallelujah! let our voices
  Rise to heav'n with full accord;
Hallelujah! ev'ry moment
  Brings us nearer to the Lord.

4 But our earnest supplication,
  Holy God, we raise to thee;
Bring us to thy blissful presence.
  Let us all thy glory see.

      Let us praise him, let us praise him, let us praise him to-day,
      And sing his loving kindness on our way.

  Pure, unbounded grace is thine;

Sound his praise thro' earth and heaven,
  Sound Jehovah's praise on high.

_Praise of Divine Love._

O worship the King, all-glorious above,
And gratefully sing his wonderful love;
Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of days,
Pavilioned in splendor and girdled with praise.

2 Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite?
It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;
It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,
And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.

3 Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,
In thee do we trust, nor find thee to fail;
Thy mercies, how tender! how firm to the end,
Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!

4 Our Father and God, how faithful thy love!
While angels delight to hymn thee above,
The humbler creation, though feeble their lays.
With true adoration shall lisp to thy praise.

And still he is nigh, his presence we have;
The great congregation his triumph shall sing,
Ascribing salvation to Jesus our King.

  Where my Redeemer God
Unveils the glories of his face,
  And sheds his love abroad!

2 Here, on the mercy seat,
  With radiant glory crowned,
Our joyful eyes behold him sit,
  And smile on all around.

3 To him their prayers and cries,
  Each contrite soul presents;
And while he hears their humble sighs
  He grants them all their wants.

4 Give me, O Lord, a place
  Within thy blest abode;
Among the children of thy grace,
  The servants of my God.

Lord! we come before thee now;
At thy feet we humbly bow;
Oh, do not our suit disdain;
Shall we seek thee, Lord, in vain?

2 Send some message from thy word,
That may joy and peace afford;
Let thy Spirit now impart
Full salvation to each heart.

3 Comfort those who weep and mourn;
Let the time of joy return;
Those that are cast down lift up,
Strong in faith, in love, and hope.

4 Grant that those who seek may find
Thee, a God sincere and kind;
Heal the sick, the captive free,
Let us all rejoice in thee.

Teach us to rejoice with trembling;
  Speak, and let thy servants hear--
      Hear with meekness--
  Hear thy word with godly fear.

2 While our days on earth are lengthened,
  May we give them, Lord, to thee;
Cheered by hope, and daily strengthened,
  May we run, nor weary be,
      Till thy glory
  Without clouds in heaven we see.

3 There, in worship, purer, sweeter,
  Thee thy people shall adore;
Tasting of enjoyment greater
  Far than thought conceived before;
       Full enjoyment,
  Full, unmixed, and evermore.

  Fill our hearts with joy and peace;
Let us each, thy love possessing,
  Triumph in redeeming grace;
       Oh! refresh us,
  Traveling through this wilderness.

2 Thanks we give and adoration,
  For thy gospel's joyful sound;
May the fruits of thy salvation
  In our hearts and lives abound;
       May thy presence
  With us, evermore, be found.

3 So, whene'er the signal's given,
  Us from earth to call away,
Borne on angel's wings to heaven,
  Glad the summons to obey,
       We shall surely
  Reign with Christ in endless day.

God of our salvation! hear us;
  Bless, oh, bless us, ere we go;
When we join the world, be near us,
  Lest we cold and careless grow.
       Savior! keep us;
  Keep us safe from every foe.

2 As our steps are drawing nearer
  To our everlasting home,
May our view of heaven grow clearer,
  Hope more bright of joys to come;
       And, when dying,
  May thy presence cheer the gloom.

     Thomas Kelly, 1809.

_Psalm 84._     (119)

Great God! attend while Zion sings
The joy that from thy presence springs;
To spend one day with thee on earth
Exceeds a thousand days of mirth.

2 Might I enjoy the meanest place
Within thy house, O God of grace!
Not tents of ease, nor thrones of power,
Should tempt my feet to leave thy door.

3 God is our sun, he makes our day;
God is our shield, he guards our way
From all th' assaults of hell and sin,
From foes without and foes within.

4 All needful grace will God bestow,
And crown that grace with glory too;
He gives us all things, and withholds
No real good from upright souls.

5 O God, our King! whose sovereign sway
The glorious hosts of heaven obey,
And devils at thy presence flee;
Blest is the man that trusts in thee!

  And seek the presence of our Lord!
Dear Savior! on thy people smile,
  And come, according to thy word.

2 From busy scenes we now retreat,
  That we may here converse with thee:
Ah! Lord! behold us at thy feet;--
  Let this the gate of heaven be.

3 Chief of ten thousand! now appear,
  That we by faith may see thy face;
Oh! speak, that we thy voice may hear
  And let thy presence fill this place.

     Thomas Kelly, 1809.


37     Mendon. L.M.

_Psalm 84._     (127)

How pleasant, how divinely fair,
O Lord of hosts, thy dwellings are!
With long desire my spirit faints,
To meet the assemblies of thy saints.

2 My flesh would rest in thine abode;
My panting heart cries out for God;
My God! my King! why should I be
So far from all my joys and thee?

3 Blest are the souls who find a place
Within the temple of thy grace;
There they behold thy gentler rays,
And seek thy face and learn thy praise.

4 Blest are the men whose hearts are set
To find the way to Zion's gate;
God is their strength, and through the road
They lean upon their helper, God.

5 Cheerful they walk with growing strength,
Till all shall meet in heaven at length;
Till all before thy face appear,
And join in nobler worship there.

     Isaac Watts, 1719

_Before Sermon._     (122)

Thy presence, gracious God! afford:
Prepare us to receive thy word;
Now let thy voice engage our ear,
And faith be mixed with what we hear.

2 Distracting thoughts and cares remove,
And fix our hearts and hopes above;
With food divine may we be fed
And satisfied with living bread.

3 To us thy sacred word apply,
With sovereign power and energy;
And may we, in thy faith and fear,
Reduce to practice what we hear.

4 Father, in us thy Son reveal;
Teach us to know and do thy will;
Thy saving power and love display.
And guide us to the realms of day.
