    O, who that saw thy parting hour
      Could wish thee here again!

3   Triumphant in thy closing eye
      The hope of glory shone;
    Joy breathed in thy expiring sigh,
      To think the race was run.

4   The passing spirit gently fled,
      Sustained by grace divine;
    O, may such grace on us be shed,
      And make our end like thine.

Death of Parents.


1   The God of mercy will indulge
      The flowing tear, the heaving sigh,
    When honored parents fall around,
      When friends beloved and kindred die.

2   Yet not one anxious, murmuring thought
      Should with our mourning passions blend;
    Nor should our bleeding hearts forget
      Their mighty, ever-living Friend.

3   Parent, Protector, Guardian, Guide,
      Thou art each tender name in one;
    On thee we cast our every care,
      And comfort seek from thee alone.

4   To thee, our Father, would we look,
      Our Rock, our Portion, and our Friend,
    And on thy gracious love and truth
      With humble, steadfast hope depend.

The Pastor's Funeral.


1   Father, gathered round the bier,
    Aid thy weeping children here;
    All our stricken hearts deplore
    Loss of him we meet no more.

2   Tender are the rites we pay,
    Pastor, o'er thy sleeping clay;
    We, who late the welcome gave,
    Must we bear thee to thy grave?

3   Earth, unto thy faithful trust,
    We commit this precious dust,
    There, by pain no more oppressed,
    Brother, thou wilt sweetly rest.

4   Glorious will that morning break,
    When the dead in Christ shall wake;
    Joy and grief our bosoms swell,
    Brother, pastor, guide, farewell.

Death of a Minister.


1   On Zion's holy walls
      Is quenched a beacon-light,
    In vain the watchman calls--
      "Sentry! what of the night?"
    No answering voice is here,
      Say--does the soldier sleep?
    O yes--upon the bier,
      His watch no more to keep.

2   Still is that heaven-touched tongue,
      Pulseless the throbbing breast;
    That voice with music strung,
      Forever put to rest.
    To rest? A living thought,
      Undimmed, unquenched, he soars
    An essence, spirit-wrought,
      Of yon immortal shores.

3   Peace to thee, man of God!
      Thine earthly toils are o'er,
    The thorny path is trod,
      The Shepherd trod before,--
    Full well he kept his word--
      "I'm with thee to the end;
    Fear not! I am the Lord,
      Thy never-failing friend!"

4   We weave no dirge for thee,
      It should not call a tear
    To know that thou art free;
      Thy home--it was not here!
    Joy to thee, man of God!
      Thy heaven-course is begun,
    Unshrinking, thou has trod
      Death's vale,--thy race is run.

      In God's temple, once so dear,
    And the mourner's bitter sighing
      Falls unheeded on thine ear.

3   All thy love and zeal, to lead us
      Where immortal fountains flow,
    And on living bread to feed us,
      In our fond remembrance glow.

      When thy foot on Jordan pressed,
    Guide our spirits while we leave thee
      In the tomb that Jesus blessed.

1   Farewell, thou once a mortal,
      Our poor, afflicted friend;
    Go, pass the heavenly portal,
      To God, thy glorious end.

2   The Author of thy being
      Hath summoned thee away;
    And faith is lost in seeing,
      And night in endless day.

3   With those that went before thee,
      The saints of ancient days,
    Who shine in sacred story,
      Thy soul hath found its place.

4   No loss of friends shall grieve thee;
      That--we alone must bear;
    They cannot, cannot leave thee,
      Thy kind companions there.

5   From all thy care and sorrow
      Thou art escaped to-day;
    And we shall mount to-morrow,
      And soar to thee away.

The Christian's Death.


1   Lo! the prisoner is released,
      Lightened of his fleshly load;
    Where the weary are at rest,
      He is gathered unto God:
    Lo! the pain of life is past,
      And his warfare now is o'er;
    Death and hell behind are cast,
      Grief and suffering are no more,

2   Yes! the Christian's course is run,
      Ended is the glorious strife;
    Fought the fight, the crown is won,
      Death is swallowed up of life;
    Borne by angels on their wings,
      Far from earth his spirit flies
    To the Lord he loved, and sings
      Triumphing in paradise.

3   Join we then with one accord
      In the new and joyful song;
    Absent from our glorious Lord
      We shall not continue long:
    We shall quit the house of clay,
      Better joys with him to share;
    We shall see the realms of day,
      We shall meet our brethren there.

1   O, weep not for the joys that fade
      Like evening lights away,
    For hopes that, like the stars decayed,
      Have left thy mortal day;
    The clouds of sorrow will depart,
      And brilliant skies be given;
    For bliss awaits the holy heart,
      Amid the bowers of heaven.

2   O weep not for the friends that pass
      Into the lonely grave,
    As breezes sweep the withered grass
      Along the restless wave;
    For though thy pleasures may depart,
      And mournful days be given;
    Yet bliss awaits the holy heart,
      When friends rejoin in heaven.

Consolations in Bereavement.


1   The air of death breathes through our souls,
      The dead all round us lie;
    By day and night the death-bell tolls,
      And says, "Prepare to die!"

2   The loving ones we loved the best,
      Like music all are gone;
    And the wan moonlight bathes in rest,
      Their monumental stone.

3   But not when the death-prayer is said,
      The life of life departs:
    The body in the grave is laid,
      Its beauty in our hearts.

4   This frame, O God, this feeble breath,
      Thy hand may soon destroy;
    We think of thee, and feel in death
      A deep and awful joy.

5   Dim is the light of vanished years
      In glory yet to come;
    O idle grief! O foolish tears!

      On wings of faith and love,
    To meet the Saviour they adore,
      And reign with him above.

    Troubled with storms, and big with showers,
    No cheerful gleam of light appears,
    And nature pours forth all her tears.

    Are in these watered furrows sown:
    See the green blades, how thick they rise,
    And with fresh verdure bless our eyes!

3   In secret foldings they contain
    Unnumbered ears of golden grain:
    And heaven shall pour its beams around,
    Till the ripe harvest load the ground.

4   Then shall the trembling mourner come
    And bind his sheaves and bear them home;
    The voice long broke with sighs shall sing,
    Till heaven with hallelujahs ring.

    Which covers all that was a friend,
    And from his voice, his hand, his smile,

    For thou didst weep o'er Lazarus dead.

    And wipe the latest tear away.

3   Full many a throb of grief and pain
      Thy frail and erring child must know:
    But not one prayer is breathed in vain,
      Nor does one tear unheeded flow.

4   Thy various messengers employ;
      Thy purposes of love fulfil;
    And 'mid the wreck of human joy,
      Let kneeling faith adore thy will.




622.              C. M.                     Watts.

Confidence in God.


1   Soon as I heard my Father say,
      "Ye children, seek my grace,"
    My heart replied without delay,
      "I'll seek my Father's face."

2   Let not thy face be hid from me,
      Nor frown my soul away;
    God of my life, I fly to thee
      In each distressing day.

3   Should friends and kindred, near and dear,
      Leave me to want, or die,
    My God will make my life his care,
      And all my need supply.

4   Wait on the Lord, ye trembling saints
      And keep your courage up;
    He'll raise your spirit when it faints,
      And far exceed your hope.

Comforts of Religion.


1   When gloomy thoughts and boding fears
      The trembling heart invade,
    And all the face of nature wears
      A universal shade,--

2   Religion's dictates can assuage
      The tempest of the soul;
    And every fear shall cease to rage,
      At her divine control.

3   When feeble reason, tired and blind,
      Sinks helpless and afraid,
    This blest supporter of the mind
      Affords a powerful aid.

4   O may our hearts confess her power,
      And find a sweet relief,
    To brighten every gloomy hour,
      And soften every grief!




624.              L. M.              Tate & Brady.

Confidence in the Divine Care.


1   No change of times shall ever shock
      My firm affection, Lord, to thee;
    For thou hast always been a rock,
      A fortress and defence to me.

2   Thou my Deliverer art, my God;
      My trust is in thy mighty power;
    Thou art my shield from foes abroad,
      At home my safeguard and my tower.

3   To heaven I made my mournful prayer,
      To God addressed my humble moan,
    Who graciously inclined his ear,
      And heard me from his lofty throne.

4   Who, then, deserves to be adored,
      But God, on whom my hopes depend?
    Or who, except the mighty Lord,
      Can with resistless power defend?




625.            C. P. M.                   Cotton.

Contentment and Resignation.


1   If solid happiness we prize,
    Within our breasts the jewel lies;
      Nor need we roam abroad:
    The world has little to bestow;
    From pious hearts our joys must flow,
      Hearts that delight in God.

2   To be resigned, when ills betide,
    Patient, when favors are denied,
      And pleased with favors given;
    This is the wise, the virtuous part;
    This is that incense of the heart,
      Whose fragrance reaches heaven.

3   Thus through life's changing scenes we'll go,
    Its checkered paths of joy and woe,
      With holy care we'll tread:
    Quit its vain scenes without a tear,
    Without a trouble or a fear,
      And mingle with the dead.




626.              C. M.                   Aveling.

Fear not.


1   Whene'er the clouds of sorrow roll,
      And trials whelm the mind,--
    When, faint with grief, thy wearied soul
      No joys on earth can find,--
    Then lift thy voice to God on high,
      Dry up the trembling tear,
    And hush the low complaining sigh:
      Fear not; thy God is near.

2   When dark temptations spread their snares
      And earth with charms allures,
    And when thy soul, oppressed with fears,
      The world's assault endures,
    Then let thy Father's friendly voice
      Thy fainting spirit cheer,
    And bid thy trembling heart rejoice:
      Fear not; thy God is near.

3   And when the final hour shall come,
      That calls thee to thy rest,
    To dwell within thy heavenly home,
      A welcome, joyful guest,
    Be calm; though Jordan's waves may roll,
      No ills shall meet thee there;
    Angels shall whisper to thy soul,
      Fear not; thy God is near.




627.              C. M.                 Doddridge.

Trust in the Presence and Help of God.


1   And art thou with us, gracious Lord,
      To dissipate our fear?
    Dost thou proclaim thyself our God,
      Our God forever near?

2   Doth thy right hand, which formed the earth,
      And bears up all the skies,
    Stretch from on high its friendly aid,
      When dangers round us rise?

3   On this support our souls shall lean,
      And banish every care;
    The gloomy vale of death will smile,
      If God be with us there.

4   While we his gracious succor prove,
      'Midst all our various ways,
    The darkest shades, through which we pass,
      Shall echo with his praise.




628.              L. M.                   Beddome.

Submission.


1   Wait, O my soul, thy Maker's will!
    Tumultuous passions, all be still!
    Nor let one murmuring thought arise;
    His ways are just, his counsels wise.

2   He in the thickest darkness dwells,
    Performs his work,--the cause conceals;
    But though his methods are unknown,
    Judgment and truth support his throne.

3   In heaven, and earth, and air, and seas,
    He executes his firm decrees;
    And by his saints it stands confessed
    That what he does is ever best.




629.              C. M.             Burder's Coll.

Rejoicing in Adversity.


1   What though no flowers the fig-tree clothe
      Though vines their fruit deny,
    The labor of the olive fail,
      And fields no meat supply;--

2   Though from the fold, with sad surprise,
      My flock cut off I see;
    Though famine reign in empty stalls,
      Where herds were wont to be;--

3   Yet in the Lord will I be glad,
      And glory in his love;
    In him I'll joy, who will the God
      Of my salvation prove.

4   God is the treasure of my soul,
      The source of lasting joy--
    A joy which want shall not impair,
      Nor death itself destroy.




630.              C. M.                 Anonymous.

"Blessed are they that mourn."


1   In trouble and in grief, O God,
      Thy smile hath cheered my way;
    And joy hath budded from each thorn
      That round my footsteps lay.

2   The hours of pain have yielded good,
      Which prosperous days refused;
    As herbs, though scentless when entire,
      Spread fragrance when they're bruised.

3   The oak strikes deeper as its boughs
      By furious blasts are driven;
    So life's vicissitudes the more
      Have fixed my heart in heaven.

4   All-gracious Lord! whate'er my lot
      In other times may be,
    I'll welcome still the heaviest grief,
      That brings me near to thee.




631.              L. M.                   Bowring.
