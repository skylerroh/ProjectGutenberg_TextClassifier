  practice in modern books to put marks of musical expression to the
  words, directing the congregation when to sing loud or soft. This
  implies a habit of congregational performance the description of which
  would make a companion picture to the organ gallery of 1830. It seems
  to me a practice of inconceivable degradation: one asks in trembling if
  it is to be extended to the Psalms. It is just as if the congregation
  were school-children singing to please a musical inspector, and he a
  stupid one.

[21]It must be due to unwillingness that comparatively so few of our
  clergy can take their part in the service when it is musical. Village
  schoolmasters tell me that two hours a week is sufficient in a few
  months to bring all the children up to a standard of time and tune and
  reading at sight that would suffice a minor canon.


PREFACE TO THE
YATTENDON HYMNAL

Among the old melodies which it is the chief object of this book to
  restore to use, some will be found which will be quite new to the
  public, while others will be familiar though in a somewhat different
  form; and since the sources whence all the tunes are taken are well
  known, and have been already largely drawn upon by the compilers of
  Psalters and Hymnals, any melody which is new in this book may be
  considered as having been hitherto overlooked or rejected, while in the
  alternative case it is to be understood that the original cast of the
  melody has at some former time been altered (frequently to suit the
  English common metre to which it was not at first conformable), and is
  now restored.

The plain-song tunes, of which an account is given in the preface to the
notes, and the few other old tunes which do not fall into either of the
two above-mentioned classes, were included for the sake of their
settings.

With respect to the vocal settings in four parts it may be said that, in
the numerous cases in which such settings were not added by the composer
of the melody, the editors have done their best to supply the want in a
suitable manner, and with some attempt towards the particular qualities
of workmanship upon which much of the beauty of the old vocal
counterpoint depends; and this latter aim has also governed the
composition of the six tunes not derived from old sources which have been
included in the work.

This book is offered in no antiquarian spirit. The greater number of
these old tunes are, without question, of an excellence which sets them
above either the enhancement or the ruin of Time, and at present when so
much attention is given to music it is to be desired that such
masterpieces should not be hidden away from the public, or only put forth
in a corrupt and degraded form. The excellence of a nation in music can
have no other basis than the education and practice of the people; and
the quality of the music which is most universally sung must largely
determine the public taste for good or ill.

Since such information as might be looked for in an introduction is given
in the notes at the end of the volume, there is nothing to add here but a
list of the sources and composers in order of date, which should in the
eyes of musicians go far to justify this attempt.

NOTE

'The seven tunes by Tallis are all transcripts of his original four-part
compositions. Only two of these tunes are in the common books; one of
them "The Ordinal" is always reset, the other "Canon," which is usually
sung to Bp. Ken's evening hymn, is completely altered, the canon being
put in a different position and the harmony changed. This tune is I
believe correctly edited for the first time in the Y. H. and it is now
thus sung at Wells Cathedral.

'Of the eight tunes by Orlando Gibbons, two only (and these altered both
in rhythm and harmony) appear in the common books. All Gibbons' tunes are
given in the Y. H. with his own bass, the inner parts being supplied.

'There is a complete list of the music in the word-book of the Yattendon
Hymnal, which is published by Mr. Blackwell of Broad Street, Oxford, and
may be bought for 1_s._ 6_d._'


THE
PREFACE TO THE NOTES

The origin of this book was my attempt, when precentor of a village
choir, to provide better settings of the hymns than those in use.

When I gave up my office, I printed the first twenty-five hymns for the
convenience of the choir, and also for the sake of the tunes by Jeremy
Clark, which I had been at some pains to restore, and for the
preservation of the tunes composed on our behalf by Professor Wooldridge.

My choice of music had so far been limited to tunes, for which suitable
words were to be found in _Hymns Ancient & Modern_; but by the time that
these first tunes were printed, I determined to continue the book free of
this restriction, and, from whatever source, to provide words for tunes
which I had hitherto been unable to use. I then became aware of a real
cause for the absence of most of these tunes from the common hymnals:
_there were no words of any kind to which they could be sung_. Having
already translated some of the old Latin hymns for their proper melodies,
I was thence led on to the more difficult task of supplying the greater
need of these other tunes; the result being that over forty of these
hundred hymns have english words newly written by myself. Almost all of
these new hymns are in some sense translations, for even where an
original hymn could not be followed in its entirety, as an old Latin hymn
generally may be, there was usually a foundation to begin upon, and I
never failed to find the music conditioning, dictating, or inspiring the
remainder. I did not willingly engage in this, nor until I had searched
word-books of all kinds; a fruitless labour, unless for the hope begotten
thereof that my practice in versifying and my love for music may together
have created something of at least relative value.

The unusual method which I was constrained to follow, that is of writing
words to suit existing music, has its advantages. In some cases, as will
be seen in the notes to the hymns, the musician, out of despair or even
contempt for the doggrel offered to him, has composed a fine tune quite
independent of the words to which it was dedicated[22], and such tunes
have been silent ever since they were composed: while even when a melody
has been actually inspired by a particular hymn, the attention of the
composer to the first stanza has not infrequently set up a hirmos, or at
least a musical scheme of feeling, which, not having been in the mind of
the writer of the words, is not carried out in his other stanzas[23]:
indeed, as every one must have observed, the words of hymns have too
often been written with insufficient attention to the conditions which a
repetition of any music to every stanza must impose. To get rid of such
discrepancies between words and music is advantageous to both, and
although this treatment cannot of course be applied to english
hymns,--which it is not allowable to alter, except in cases of glaring
unfitness or absurdity, such as would if uncorrected cause the neglect of
a good hymn[24],--yet, where the hymn has to be translated from a foreign
language, some reconstruction is generally inevitable, and it can follow
no better aim than that of the mutual enforcement of words and music. And
the words owe a courtesy to the music; for if a balance be struck between
the words and music of hymns, it will be found to be heavily in favour of
the musicians, whose fine work has been unscrupulously altered and
reduced to dullness by english compilers, with the object of conforming
it in rhythm to words that are unworthy of any music whatever. The chief
offenders here are the protestant reformers, whose metrical psalms, which
the melodies were tortured to fit, exhibit greater futility than one
