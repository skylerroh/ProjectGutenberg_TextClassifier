Christ's Resurrection.


1   Angels, roll the rock away;
    Death, yield up thy mighty prey;
    See! he rises from the tomb,
    Glowing with immortal bloom.

2   'T is the Saviour! Angels, raise
    Fame's eternal trump of praise;
    Let the earth's remotest bound
    Hear the joy-inspiring sound.

3   Now, ye saints, lift up your eyes;
    Now to glory see him rise
    In long triumph up the sky--
    Up to waiting worlds on high.

4   Praise him, all ye heavenly choirs,
    Praise, and sweep your golden lyres;
    Shout, O earth, in rapturous song;
    Let the strains be sweet and strong.

5   Every note with wonder swell,--
    And the Saviour's triumph tell;
    Where, O death, is now thy sting?
    Where thy terrors, vanquished king?

1   Morning breaks upon the tomb!
    Jesus dissipates its gloom!
    Day of triumph through the skies,
    See the glorious Saviour rise!

2   Christians, dry your flowing tears;
    Chase those unbelieving fears;
    Look on his deserted grave;
    Doubt no more his power to save.

3   Ye who are of death afraid,
    Triumph in the scattered shade;
    Drive your anxious fears away;
    See the place where Jesus lay.

4   So the rising sun appears,
    Shedding radiance o'er the spheres;
    So returning beams of light
    Chase the terrors of the night.

      To God the sovereign King!
    Let every land their tongues employ,
      And hymns of triumph sing.

2   Jesus, our God, ascends on high;
      His heavenly guards around
    Attend him rising through the sky,
      With trumpet's joyful sound.

3   While angels shout and praise their King,
      Let mortals learn their strains;
    Let all the earth his honors sing;
      O'er all the earth he reigns.

4   Speak forth his praise with awe profound;
      Let knowledge guide the song;
    Nor mock him with a solemn sound
      Upon a thoughtless tongue.

1   My dear Redeemer, and my Lord,
    I read my duty in thy word:
    But in thy life the law appears,
    Drawn out in living characters.

2   Such was thy truth, and such thy zeal,
    Such deference to thy Father's will,
    Such love, and meekness so divine,
    I would transcribe, and make them mine.

3   Cold mountains, and the midnight air,
    Witnessed the fervor of thy prayer,
    The desert thy temptations knew,
    Thy conflict, and thy victory, too.

4   Be thou my pattern; may I bear
    More of thy gracious image here;
    Then God, the Judge, shall own my name
    Among the followers of the Lamb.

      Appears each grace divine;
    The virtues, all in Jesus met,
      With mildest radiance shine.

2   To spread the rays of heavenly light,
      To give the mourner joy,
    To preach glad tidings to the poor,
      Was his divine employ.

3   'Midst keen reproach and cruel scorn,
      Patient and meek he stood;
    His foes, ungrateful, sought his life;
      He labored for their good.

4   In the last hour of deep distress,
      Before his Father's throne,
    With soul resigned, he bowed, and said,
      "Thy will, not mine, be done!"

5   Be Christ our pattern and our guide!
      His image may we bear!
    O, may we tread his holy steps,
      His joy and glory share!

Excellency of Christ.


1   O, could we speak the matchless worth,
    O, could we sound the glories forth,
      Which in our Saviour shine,
    We'd soar, and touch the heavenly strings,
    And vie with Gabriel, while he sings,
      In notes almost divine.

2   We'd sing the characters he bears,
    And all the forms of love he wears,
      Exalted on his throne:
    In loftiest songs of sweetest praise,
    We would, to everlasting days,
      Make all his glories known.

3   O, the delightful day will come,
    When Christ our Lord will bring us home
      And we shall see his face;
    Then, with our Saviour, Brother, Friend,
    A blest eternity we'll spend,
      Triumphant in his grace.

Christ's Submission to his Father's Will.


1   "Father divine," the Saviour cried,
    While horrors pressed on every side,
    And prostrate on the ground he lay,
    "Remove this bitter cup away.

2   "But if these pangs must still be borne
    Or helpless man be left forlorn,
    I bow my soul before thy throne,
    And say, Thy will, not mine, be done."

3   Thus our submissive souls would bow,
    And, taught by Jesus, lie as low;
    Our hearts, and not our lips alone,
    Would say, Thy will, not ours, be done.

4   Then, though like him in dust we lie,
    We'll view the blissful moment nigh,
    Which, from our portion in his pains,
    Calls to the joy in which he reigns.

"Greater love hath no man than this."


1   "See how he loved!" exclaimed the Jews,
      As tender tears from Jesus fell;
    My grateful heart the thought pursues,
      And on the theme delights to dwell.

2   See how he loved, who travelled on,
      Teaching the doctrine from the skies;
    Who bade disease and pain be gone,
      And called the sleeping dead to rise.

3   See how he loved, who never shrank
      From toil or danger, pain or death;
    Who all the cup of sorrow drank,
      And meekly yielded up his breath.

4   Such love can we unmoved survey?
      O may our breasts with ardor glow,
    To tread his steps, his laws obey,
      And thus our warm affections show.

    To find a pathway to the skies,
      A light from heaven's eternal glow--

      Through which the saints undoubting trod,
    Till faith discovers, like the dove,
      An ark, a resting-place in God.

2   Thou art the Truth--whose steady day
      Shines on through earthly blight and bloom,
    The pure, the everlasting ray,
      The lamp that shines e'en in the tomb;
    The light that out of darkness springs,
      And guideth those that blindly go;
    The word whose precious radiance flings
      Its lustre upon all below.

3   Thou art the Life--the blessed well,
      With living waters gushing o'er,
    Which those that drink shall ever dwell
      Where sin and thirst are known no more.
    Thou art the mystic pillar given,
      Our lamp by night, our light by day;
    Thou art the sacred bread from heaven;
      Thou art the Life--the Truth--the Way.

    The threatening billows cease to flow,
      The winds obey their Lord.

      And all in torture died;
    'T was love that bowed his fainting head,
      And oped his gushing side.

      Nor share his grief alone,
    But from his cross pursue their flight

Gospel Call to the Church.

      Now the grateful tribute raise;
    Solemn songs, to heaven ascending,
      Join the universal praise.

    Lo, the sacred page before us
      Bears the promise of his love,
    Full of mercy to restore us,
      Mercy beaming from above.

3   Every secret fault confessing,
      Deed unrighteous, thought of sin,
    Seize, O seize the proffered blessing,
      Grace from God, and peace within!
    Heart and voice with rapture swelling,
      Still the song of glory raise;
    On the theme immortal dwelling,

The Gospel Advancing.


1   Brighter shines the gospel day
      On our Zion's mountains;
    Clearer has become the way
      To her living fountains.
    Hark! the stirring trumpet tone
    Hath o'er every hill-top flown;
    Error's hosts retiring see!
    Superstition's minions flee!

2   From the luring haunts of sin
      Where the soul is blighted,
    Christ invites--come enter in
      To the temple lighted
    With the beams of pardoning love--
    With the wisdom from above;
    Leave the woes of sin behind,
    And a rest perpetual find.

3   Come from error's hoary shrine,
      Jew or Gentile seeking
    For the way of life divine--
      Hear this voice now speaking!
    Willing hearts and hands prepare
    Christ's redeeming grace to share;
    Join our triumph-strain, and sing
    Zion's Universal King.

      Are in the gospel found!

      Who hears the joyful sound.

2   Come, then, with all your wants and wounds;
      Your every burden bring;
    Here love, unchanging love, abounds,
      A deep, celestial spring.

      And heavenly joy imparts;
    Come, thirsty souls, your wants disclose,
      And drink with thankful hearts.

1     Now is the day of grace;
      Now to the Father come;
    The Lord is calling, "Seek my face,
      And I will guide you home."

2     The Saviour bids you speed;
      O, wherefore then delay?
    He calls in love; he sees your need;
      He bids you come to-day.

3     To-day the prize is won;
      The promise is to save;
    Then, O, be wise; to-morrow's sun
      May shine upon your grave.

Invitation to the Gospel Feast.


1   Ye wretched, hungry, starving poor,
      Behold a royal feast,
    Where mercy spreads her bounteous store,
      For every humble guest!

2   See, Jesus stands with open arms!
      He calls, he bids you come;--
    Guilt holds you back, and fear alarms,--
      But see, there yet is room!

3   Come then, and with his people taste
      The blessings of his love;
    While hope attends the sweet repast,
      Of nobler joys above.

4   There, with united heart and voice,
      Before the eternal throne,
    Ten thousand thousand souls rejoice
      In ecstasies unknown.

5   And yet ten thousand thousand more
      Are welcome still to come:
    Ye longing souls, the grace adore;--
    Approach, there yet is room.

1   From the holy mount above,
    Glowing in the light of love,
    What melodious sounds we hear,
    Bursting on the ravished ear!
    "At the feast there yet is room--
    Come and welcome, sinner, come.

2   "Thou shalt be a welcome guest,
    By the Lord divinely blest;--
    In the word of truth believe,--
    All thy sinful pleasures leave,
    And no more in darkness roam,--
    Come and welcome, sinner, come.

3   "God is thy unchanging Friend;
    He will love thee to the end,
    And at last thy soul convey
    To the realms of endless day,
    To a blessed spirit-home,--
    Come and welcome, sinner, come."

The Sinner entreated to awake.


1   Sinner, rouse thee from thy sleep;
    Wake, and o'er thy folly weep;
    Raise thy spirit, dark and dead;
    Jesus waits his light to shed.

2   Wake from sleep; arise from death;
    See the bright and living path;
    Watchful, tread that path; be wise;
    Leave thy folly; seek the skies.

3   Leave thy folly; cease from crime;
    From this hour redeem thy time;
    Life secure without delay;
    Brief is this thy mortal day.

4   O, then, rouse thee from thy sleep;
    Wake, and o'er thy folly weep;
    Jesus calls from death and night;
    Jesus waits to shed his light.

The Gospel gives Peace and Rest.


1   Peace, troubled soul, whose plaintive moan
      Hath taught these rocks the notes of woe;
    Cease thy complaints, suppress thy groan,
      And let thy tears forget to flow:
    Behold the precious balm is found,
    Which lulls thy pain, which heals thy wound.

2   Come, freely come; by sin oppressed,
      Unburden here the weighty load,
    Here find thy refuge and thy rest,
      And trust the mercy of thy God:
    Thy God's thy Father,--glorious word!
    Forever love and praise the Lord.

3   As spring the winter, day the night,
      Peace sorrow's gloom shall chase away,
    And smiling joy, a seraph bright,
      Shall tend thy steps and near thee stay;
    Whilst glory weaves th' immortal crown,
    And waits to claim thee for her own.

Invitation.


1   Pilgrim, burdened with thy sin,
      Come the way to Zion's gate,
    There, till mercy speaks within,
      Knock, and weep, and watch and wait--
    Knock--he knows the sinner's cry,
      Weep--he loves the mourner's tears,
    Watch--for saving grace is nigh,
      Wait--till heavenly grace appears.
