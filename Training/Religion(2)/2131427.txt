Somewhat disheartened, he patiently seeks another
dwelling,--only to find its inmates asleep at noontide!
Robust forms, with manly brow nodding on cushioned [15]
chairs, their feet resting on footstools, or, flat on their
backs, lie stretched on the floor, dreaming away the
hours. Balancing on one foot, with eyes half open,
the porter starts up in blank amazement and looks at
the Stranger, calls out, rubs his eyes,--amazed beyond [20]
measure that anybody is animated with a purpose, and
seen working for it!

They in this house are those that "provoke Him in
the wilderness, and grieve Him in the desert." Away
from this charnel-house of the so-called living, the Stranger [25]
turns quickly, and wipes off the dust from his feet as a
testimony against sensualism in its myriad forms. As
he departs, he sees robbers finding ready ingress to that
dwelling of sleepers in the midst of murderous hordes,
without watchers and the doors unbarred! [30]

Next he enters a place of worship, and saith unto them,
"Go ye into all the world; preach the gospel, heal the

[Page 326.]

sick, cast out devils, raise the dead; for the Scripture [1]
saith the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath
made you free from the law of sin and death." And _they_
_cast him out_.

Once more he seeks the dwelling-place of mortals and [5]
knocks loudly. The door is burst open, and sufferers
shriek for help: that house is on fire! The flames caught
in the dwelling of luxury, where the blind saw them not,
but the flesh at length did feel them; thence they spread
to the house of slumberers who heeded them not, until [10]
they became unmanageable; fed by the fat of hypocrisy
and vainglory, they consumed the next dwelling; then
crept unseen into the synagogue, licking up the blood
of martyrs and wrapping their altars in ruins. "God is a
consuming fire." [15]

Thus are all mortals, under every hue of circumstances,
driven out of their houses of clay and, homeless wan-
derers in a beleaguered city, forced to seek the Father's
house, if they would be led to the valley and up the
mount. [20]

Seeing the wisdom of withdrawing from those who
persistently rejected him, the Stranger returned to the
valley; first, to meet with joy his own, to wash their
feet, and take them up the mountain. Well might this
heavenly messenger exclaim, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, [25]
thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which
are sent unto thee,... Behold, your house is left unto
you desolate."

Discerning in his path the penitent one who had groped
his way from the dwelling of luxury, the Stranger saith [30]
unto him, "Wherefore comest thou hither?"

He answered, "The sight of thee unveiled my sins, and

[Page 327.]

turned my misnamed joys to sorrow. When I went back [1]
into the house to take something out of it, my misery
increased; so I came hither, hoping that I might follow
thee whithersoever thou goest."

And the Stranger saith unto him, "Wilt thou climb [5]
the mountain, and take nothing of thine own with thee?"

He answered, "I will."

"Then," saith the Stranger, "thou hast chosen the
good part; follow me."

Many there were who had entered the valley to specu- [10]
late in worldly policy, religion, politics, finance, and to
search for wealth and fame. These had heavy baggage
of their own, and insisted upon taking all of it with them,
which must greatly hinder their ascent.

The journey commences. The encumbered travellers [15]
halt and disagree. They stoutly belay those who, hav-
ing less baggage, ascend faster than themselves, and
betimes burden them with their own. Despairing of
gaining the summit, loaded as they are, they conclude to
stop and lay down a few of the heavy weights,--but [20]
only to take them up again, more than ever determined
not to part with their baggage.

All this time the Stranger is pointing the way, show-
ing them their folly, rebuking their pride, consoling their
afflictions, and helping them on, saying, "He that loseth [25]
his life for my sake, shall find it."

Obstinately holding themselves back, and sore-footed,
they fall behind and lose sight of their guide; when,
stumbling and grumbling, and fighting each other, they
plunge headlong over the jagged rocks. [30]

Then he who has no baggage goes back and kindly
binds up their wounds, wipes away the blood stains, and

[Page 328.]

would help them on; but suddenly the Stranger shouts, [1]
"Let them alone; they must learn from the things they
suffer. Make thine own way; and if thou strayest, listen
for the mountain-horn, and it will call thee back to the
path that goeth upward." [5]

Dear reader, dost thou suspect that the valley is hu-
mility, that the mountain is heaven-crowned Christianity,
and the Stranger the ever-present Christ, the spiritual
idea which from the summit of bliss surveys the vale of
the flesh, to burst the bubbles of earth with a breath of [10]
heaven, and acquaint sensual mortals with the mystery
of godliness,--unchanging, unquenchable Love? Hast
not thou heard this Christ knock at the door of thine own
heart, and closed it against Truth, to "eat and drink
with the drunken"? Hast thou been driven by suffer- [15]
ing to the foot of the mount, but earth-bound, burdened
by pride, sin, and self, hast thou turned back, stumbled,
and wandered away? Or hast thou tarried in the habita-
tion of the senses, pleased and stupefied, until wakened
through the baptism of fire? [20]

He alone ascends the hill of Christian Science who
follows the Way-shower, the spiritual presence and idea
of God. Whatever obstructs the way,--causing to
stumble, fall, or faint, those mortals who are striving
to enter the path,--divine Love will remove; and up- [25]
lift the fallen and strengthen the weak. Therefore, give
up thy earth-weights; and observe the apostle's admoni-
tion, "Forgetting those things which are behind, and
reaching forth unto those which are before." Then,
loving God supremely and thy neighbor as thyself, thou [30]
wilt safely bear thy cross up to the throne of everlasting
glory.

Voices Of Spring


Mine is an obstinate _penchant_ for nature in all her [2]
moods and forms, a satisfaction with whatever is hers.
And what shall this be named, a weakness, or a--
virtue? [5]

In spring, nature like a thrifty housewife sets the earth
in order; and between taking up the white carpets and
putting down the green ones, her various apartments are
dismally dirty.

Spring is my sweetheart, whose voices are sad or glad, [10]
even as the heart may be; restoring in memory the sweet
rhythm of unforgotten harmonies, or touching tenderly
its tearful tones.

Spring passes over mountain and meadow, waking up
the world; weaving the wavy grass, nursing the timid [15]
spray, stirring the soft breeze; rippling all nature in
ceaseless flow, with "breath all odor and cheek all bloom."
Whatever else droops, spring is gay: her little feet trip
lightly on, turning up the daisies, paddling the water-
cresses, rocking the oriole's cradle; challenging the sed- [20]
entary shadows to activity, and the streams to race for the
sea. Her dainty fingers put the fur cap on pussy-willow,
paint in pink the petals of arbutus, and sweep in soft
strains her Orphean lyre. "The voice of the turtle is
heard in our land." The snow-bird that tarried through [25]
the storm, now chirps to the breeze; the cuckoo sounds
her invisible lute, calling the feathered tribe back to their
summer homes. Old robin, though stricken to the heart
with winter's snow, prophesies of fair earth and sunny
skies. The brooklet sings melting murmurs to merry [30]

[Page 330.]

meadows; the leaves clap their hands, and the winds [1]
make melody through dark pine groves.

What is the anthem of human life?

Has love ceased to moan over the new-made grave,
and, looking upward, does it patiently pray for the per- [5]
petual springtide wherein no arrow wounds the dove?
Human hope and faith should join in nature's grand har-
mony, and, if on minor key, make music in the heart.
And man, more friendly, should call his race as gently
to the springtide of Christ's dear love. St. Paul wrote, [10]
"Rejoice in the Lord always." And why not, since man's
possibilities are infinite, bliss is eternal, and the conscious-
ness thereof is here and now?

The alders bend over the streams to shake out their
tresses in the water-mirrors; let mortals bow before the [15]
creator, and, looking through Love's transparency, behold
man in God's own image and likeness, arranging in the
beauty of holiness each budding thought. It is good to
talk with our past hours, and learn what report they
bear, and how they might have reported more spirit- [20]
ual growth. With each returning year, higher joys,
holier aims, a purer peace and diviner energy, should
freshen the fragrance of being. Nature's first and last
lessons teach man to be kind, and even pride should
sanction what our natures need. Popularity,--what is [25]
it? A mere mendicant that boasts and begs, and God
denies charity.

When gentle violet lifts its blue eye to heaven, and
crown imperial unveils its regal splendor to the sun;
when the modest grass, inhabiting the whole earth, stoops [30]
meekly before the blast; when the patient corn waits
on the elements to put forth its slender blade, construct

[Page 331.]

the stalk, instruct the ear, and crown the full corn in the [1]
ear,--then, are mortals looking up, waiting on God,
and committing their way unto Him who tosses earth's
mass of wonders into their hands? When downtrodden
like the grass, did it make them humble, loving, obedi- [5]
ent, full of good odor, and cause them to wait patiently
on God for man's rich heritage,--"dominion over all
the earth"? Thus abiding in Truth, the warmth and
sunlight of prayer and praise and understanding will
ripen the fruits of Spirit, and goodness will have its spring- [10]
tide of freedom and greatness.

When the white-winged dove feeds her callow brood,
nestles them under her wings, and, in tones tremulous
with tenderness, calls them to her breast, do mortals
remember _their_ cradle hymns, and thank God for those [15]
redemptive words from a mother's lips which taught
them the Lord's Prayer?


    O gentle presence, peace and joy and power;
    O Life divine, that owns each waiting hour;
    Thou Love that guards the nestling's faltering flight! [20]
    Keep Thou my child on upward wing to-night.


Midst the falling leaves of old-time faiths, above the
frozen crust of creed and dogma, the divine Mind-force,
filling all space and having all power, upheaves the earth.
In sacred solitude divine Science evolved nature as thought, [25]
and thought as things. This supreme potential Principle
reigns in the realm of the real, and is "God with us,"
the I AM.

As mortals awake from their dream of material sen-
sation, this adorable, all-inclusive God, and all earth's [30]
hieroglyphics of Love, are understood; and infinite Mind

[Page 332.]

is seen kindling the stars, rolling the worlds, reflecting [1]
all space and Life,--but not life in matter. Wisely
governing, informing the universe, this Mind is Truth,--
not laws of matter. Infinitely just, merciful, and wise,
this Mind is Love,--but not fallible love. [5]

Spring is here! and doors that closed on Christian
Science in "the long winter of our discontent," are open
flung. Its seedtime has come to enrich earth and en-
robe man in righteousness; may its sober-suited autumn
follow with hues of heaven, ripened sheaves, and harvest [10]
songs.




"Where Art Thou?"


In the allegory of Genesis, third chapter and ninth
verse, two mortals, walking in the cool of the day midst
the stately palms, many-hued blossoms, perfume-laden [15]
breezes, and crystal streams of the Orient, pondered the
things of man and God.

A sense of evil is supposed to have spoken, been listened
to, and afterwards to have formed an evil sense that
blinded the eyes of reason, masked with deformity the [20]
glories of revelation, and shamed the face of mortals.

What was this sense? Error versus Truth: first, a
supposition; second, a false belief; third, suffering;
fourth, death.

Is man the supposer, false believer, sufferer? [25]

Not man, but a mortal--the antipode of immortal
man. Supposing, false believing, suffering are not fac-
ulties of Mind, but are qualities of error.

The supposition is, that God and His idea are not all-
power; that there is something besides Him; that this [30]

[Page 333.]

something is intelligent matter; that sin--yea, self- [1]
hood--is apart from God, where pleasure and pain,
good and evil, life and death, commingle, and are for-
ever at strife; even that every ray of Truth, of infinity,
omnipotence, omnipresence, goodness, could be absorbed [5]
in error! God cannot be obscured, and this renders error
a palpable falsity, yea, nothingness; on the basis that
black is not a color because it absorbs all the rays of
light.

The "Alpha and Omega" of Christian Science voices [10]
this question: Where do we hold intelligence to be? Is
it in both evil and good, in matter as well as Spirit?
If so, we are literally and practically denying that God,
good, is supreme, _all_ power and presence, and are turn-
ing away from the only living and true God, to "lords [15]
many and gods many."

Where art thou, O mortal! who turnest away from
the divine source of being,--calling on matter to work
out the problem of Mind, to aid in understanding and
securing the sweet harmonies of Spirit that relate to the [20]
universe, including man?

Paul asked: "What communion hath light with dark-
ness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial?" The
worshippers of Baal worshipped the sun. They believed
that something besides God had authority and power, [25]
could heal and bless; that God wrought through matter
--by means of that which does not reflect Him in a single
quality or quantity!--the grand realities of Mind, thus
to exemplify the power of Truth and Love.

The ancient Chaldee hung his destiny out upon the [30]
heavens; but ancient or modern Christians, instructed in
divine Science, know that the prophet better understood

[Page 334.]

Him who said: "He doeth according to His will in the [1]
army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth;
and none can stay His hand, or say unto Him, What doest
Thou?"

Astrology is well in its place, but this place is second- [5]
ary. Necromancy has no foundation,--in fact, no
intelligence; and the belief that it has, deceives itself.
Whatever simulates power and Truth in matter, does this
as a lie declaring itself, that mortals' faith in matter may
have the effect of power; but when the whole fabrication [10]
is found to be a lie, away goes all its supposed power and
prestige.

Why do Christian Scientists treat disease _as_ disease,
since there is no disease?

This is done only as one gives the lie to a lie; because [15]
it is a lie, without one word of Truth in it. You must
find error to be _nothing_: then, and _only_ then, do you
handle it in Science. The diabolism of suppositional
evil at work in the name of good, is a lie of the highest
degree of nothingness: just reduce this falsity to its proper [20]
denomination, and you have done with it.

How shall we treat a negation, or error--by means
of matter, or Mind? Is matter Truth? No! Then it
cannot antidote error.

Can belief destroy belief? No: understanding is re- [25]
quired to do this. By the substitution of Truth demon-
strated, Science remedies the ills of material beliefs.

Because I have uncovered evil, and dis-covered for
you divine Science, which saith, "Be not overcome of
evil, but overcome evil with good," and you have not
loved sufficiently to understand this Golden Rule and
demonstrate the might of perfect Love that casteth out

[Page 335.]

all fear, shall you turn away from this divine Principle [1]
to graven images? Remember the Scripture:--

"But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart,
My lord delayeth his coming;"

"And shall begin to smite his fellow-servants, and to [5]
eat and drink with the drunken;

"The lord of that servant shall come in a day when
he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not
aware of,

"And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his por- [10]
tion with the hypocrites."

One mercilessly assails me for opposing the subtle lie,
others charge upon me with full-fledged invective for, as
they say, having too much charity; but neither moves
me from the path made luminous by divine Love. [15]

In my public works I lay bare the ability, in belief, of
evil to break the Decalogue,--to murder, steal, commit
adultery, and so on. Those who deny my wisdom or
right to expose error, are either willing participants in
wrong, afraid of its supposed power, or ignorant of it. [20]

The notion that one is covering iniquity by asserting
its nothingness, is a fault of zealots, who, like Peter,
sleep when the Watcher bids them watch, and when the
hour of trial comes would cut off somebody's ears. Such
people say, "Would you have me get out of a burning [25]
house, or stay in it?"

I would have you already out, and _know_ that you are
out; also, to remember the Scripture concerning those
who do evil that good may come,--"whose damnation
is just;" and that whoso departeth from divine Science, [30]
seeking power or good aside from God, has done himself
harm.

[Page 336.]

Mind is supreme: Love is the master of hate; Truth, [1]
the victor over a lie. Hath not Science voiced this les-
son to you,--that evil is powerless, that a lie is never
true? It is your province to wrestle with error, to handle
the serpent and bruise its head; but you cannot, as a [5]
Christian Scientist, resort to stones and clubs,--yea, to
matter,--to kill the serpent of a material mind.

Do you love that which represents God most, His highest
idea as seen to-day? No!

Then you would hate Jesus if you saw him personally, [10]
and knew your right obligations towards him. He would
insist on the rule and demonstration of divine Science:
even that you first cast out your own dislike and hatred
of God's idea,--the beam in your own eye that hinders
your seeing clearly how to cast the mote of evil out of [15]
other eyes. You cannot demonstrate the Principle of
Christian Science and not love its idea: we gather not
grapes of thorns, nor figs of thistles.

Where art thou?




Divine Science


What is it but another name for Christian Science, [21]
the cognomen of all true religion, the quintessence of
Christianity, that heals disease and sin and destroys
death! Part and parcel of Truth and Love, wherever
one ray of its effulgence looks in upon the heart, behold [25]
a better man, woman, or child.

Science is the fiat of divine intelligence, which, hoary
with eternity, touches time only to take away its frailty.
That it rests on everlasting foundations, the sequence
proves. [30]

[Page 337.]

Have I discovered and founded at this period Chris- [1]
tian Science, that which reveals the truth of Love,--is
the question.

And how can you be certain of so momentous an
affirmative? By proving its effect on yourself to be-- [5]
divine.

What is the Principle and rule of Christian Science?

Infinite query! Wonder in heaven and on earth,--
who shall say? The immaculate Son of the Blessed
has spoken of them as the Golden Rule and its Principle, [10]
God who is Love. Listen, and _he_ illustrates the rule:
"Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the
midst of them, and said,... Whosoever ... shall
humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest
in the kingdom of heaven." [15]

Harmony is heaven. Science brings out harmony;
but this harmony is not understood unless it produces a
growing affection for all good, and consequent disaffec-
tion for all evil, hypocrisy, evil-speaking, lust, envy, hate.
Where these exist, Christian Science has no sure foot- [20]
hold: they obscure its divine element, and thus seem
to extinguish it. Even the life of Jesus was belittled
and belied by personalities possessing these defacing de-
formities. Only the devout Marys, and such as lived
according to his precepts, understood the concrete char- [25]
acter of him who taught--by the wayside, in humble
homes, to itching ears and to dull disciples--the words
of Life.

The ineffable Life and light which he reflected through
divine Science is again reproduced in the character which [30]
sensualism, as heretofore, would hide or besmear. Sin
of any sort tends to hide from an individual this grand

[Page 338.]

verity in Science, that the appearing of good in an in- [1]
dividual involves the disappearing of evil. He who first
brings to humanity some great good, must have gained
its height beforehand, to be able to lift others toward
it. I first proved to myself, not by "words,"--these [5]
afford no proof,--but by demonstration of Christian
Science, that its Principle is divine. All must go and do
likewise.

Faith illumined by works; the spiritual understanding
which cannot choose but to labor and love; hope hold- [10]
ing steadfastly to good in the midst of seething evil;
charity that suffereth long and is kind, but cancels not
sin until it be destroyed,--these afford the only rule I
have found which demonstrates Christian Science.

And remember, a pure faith in humanity will subject [15]
one to deception; the uses of good, to abuses from evil;
and calm strength will enrage evil. But the very heavens
shall laugh at them, and move majestically to your defense
when the armies of earth press hard upon you.


    "Thou must be true thyself, [20]
      If thou the truth wouldst teach;
    Thy soul must overflow, if thou
      Another's soul wouldst reach;
    It needs the overflow of heart,
      To give the lips full speech." [25]

    "Think truly, and thy thoughts
      Shall the world's famine feed;
    Speak truly, and each word of thine
      Shall be a fruitful seed;
    Live truly, and thy life shall be [30]
      A great and noble creed."


[Page 339.]




Fidelity


If people would confine their talk to subjects that are [2]
profitable, that which St. John informs us took place
once in heaven, would happen very frequently on earth,--
silence for the space of half an hour. [5]

Experience is victor, never the vanquished; and out
of defeat comes the secret of victory. That to-morrow
starts from to-day and is one day beyond it, robes the
future with hope's rainbow hues.

In the battle of life, good is made more industrious [10]
and persistent because of the supposed activity of evil.
The elbowing of the crowd plants our feet more firmly.
In the mental collisions of mortals and the strain of in-
tellectual wrestlings, moral tension is tested, and, if it
yields not, grows stronger. The past admonishes us: [15]
with finger grim and cold it points to every mortal mistake;
or smiling saith, "Thou hast been faithful over a few
things."

Art thou a child, and hast added one furrow to the
brow of care? Art thou a husband, and hast pierced [20]
the heart venturing its all of happiness to thy keeping?
Art thou a wife, and hast bowed the o'erburdened head
of thy husband? Hast thou a friend, and forgettest to be
grateful? Remember, that for all this thou alone canst
and must atone. Carelessly or remorselessly thou mayest [25]
have sent along the ocean of events a wave that will some
time flood thy memory, surge dolefully at the door of con-
science, and pour forth the unavailing tear.

Change and the grave may part us; the wisdom that
might have blessed the past may come too late. One [30]

[Page 340.]

backward step, one relinquishment of right in an evil [1]
hour, one faithless tarrying, has torn the laurel from many
a brow and repose from many a heart. Good is never
the reward of evil, and _vice versa_.

There is no excellence without labor; and the time to [5]
work, is _now_. Only by persistent, unremitting, straight-
forward toil; by turning neither to the right nor to the
left, seeking no other pursuit or pleasure than that which
cometh from God, can you win and wear the crown of the
faithful. [10]

That law-school is not at fault which sends forth a
barrister who never brings out a brief. Why? Because
he followed agriculture instead of litigation, forsook
Blackstone for gray stone, dug into soils instead of delv-
ing into suits, raised potatoes instead of pleas, and drew [15]
up logs instead of leases. He has not been faithful over
a few things.
