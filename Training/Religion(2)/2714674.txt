[1] It is one of the sagacious remarks of Goethe, that "the eighteenth
century tended to analysis, but the nineteenth will deal with synthesis."

[2] Professor Cocker's work on "Christianity and Creek Philosophy," should
also be mentioned.

[3] James Foster has a sermon on "The Advantages of a Revelation," in
which he declares that, at the time of Christ's coming, "just notions of
God were, in general, erased from the minds of men. His worship was
debased and polluted, and scarce any traces could be discerned of the
genuine and immutable religion of nature."

[4] John Locke, in his "Reasonableness of Christianity," says that when
Christ came "men had given themselves up into the hands of their priests,
to fill their heads with false notions of the Deity, and their worship
with foolish rites, as they pleased; and what dread or craft once began,
devotion soon made sacred, and religion immutable." "In this state of
darkness and ignorance of the true God, vice and superstition held the
world." Quotations of this sort might be indefinitely multiplied. See an
article by the present writer, in the "Christian Examiner," March, 1857.

[9] The actual depth reached in the St. Louis well, before the enterprise
was abandoned, was 3,8431/2 feet on August 9, 1869. This well was bored
for the use of the St. Louis County Insane Asylum, at the public expense.
It was commenced March 31, 1866, under the direction of Mr. Charles H.
Atkeson. At the depth of 1,222 feet the water became saltish, then
sulphury. The temperature of the water, at the bottom of the well, was
105 deg.F. Toward the end of the work it seemed as if the limit of the
strength of wood and iron had been reached. The poles often broke at
points two or three thousand feet down. "Annual Report (1870) of the
Superintendent of the St. Louis County Insane Asylum."

[10] Andrew Wilson ("The Ever-Victorious Army, Blackwood, 1868") says that
"the Chinese people stand unsurpassed, and probably unequalled, in regard
to the possession of freedom and self-government." He denies that
infanticide is common in China. "Indeed," says he, "there is nothing a
Chinaman dreads so much as to die childless. Every Chinaman desires to
have as large a family as possible; and the labors of female children are
very profitable."

[11] Quoted by Mr. Meadows, who warrants the correctness of the account.
"The Chinese and their Rebellions," p. 404.

[12] Dr. Legge thus arranges the Sacred Books of China, or the Chinese
Classics:--

  A. The Five _King_. [_King_ means a web of cloth, or the warp which
     keeps the threads in their place.]

    (a) _Yih-King_. (Changes.)
    (b) _Shoo-King_. (History.)
    (c) _She-King_. (Odes.)
    (d) _Le-Ke-King_. (Rites.)
    (e) _Ch'un-Ts'eu_. (Spring and Autumn. Annals from B.C. 721 to 480.)

  B. The Four Books.

    (a) _Lun-Yu_. (Analects, or Table-Talk of Confucius.)
    (b) _Ta-Hio_. (Great Learning. Written by _Tsang-Sin_, a disciple
        of Confucius.)
    (c) _Chung-Yung_ (or Doctrine of the Mean), ascribed to _Kung-Keih_,
        the grandson of Confucius.
    (d) Works of _Mencius_.

After the death of Confucius there was a period in which the Sacred Books
were much corrupted, down to the _Han_ dynasty (B.C. 201 to A.D. 24),
which collected, edited, and revised them: since which time they have been
watched with the greatest care.

"The evidence is complete that the Classical Books of China have come down
from at least a century before our era, substantially the same as we have
them at present."--_Legge_, Vol. I. Chap. 1. Sec. 2.

The Four Books have been translated into French, German, and English. Dr.
Marshman translated the Lun-Yu. Mr. Collie afterward published at Calcutta
the Four Books. But within a few years the labors of previous sinologues
have been almost superseded by Dr. Legge's splendid work, still in process
of publication. We have, as yet, only the volumes containing the Four
Books of Confucius and his successors, and a portion of the Kings. Dr.
Legge's work is in Chinese and English, with copious notes and extracts
from many Chinese commentators. In his notes, and his preliminary
dissertations, he endeavors to do justice to Confucius and his doctrines.
Perhaps he does not fully succeed in this, but it is evident that he
respects the Chinese sage, and is never willingly unfair to him. If to the
books above mentioned be added the works, of Pauthier, Stanislas Julien,
Mohl, and other French sinologues, and the German works on the same
subject we have a sufficient apparatus for the study of Chinese thought.

Mr. Andrew Wilson, author of "The Ever-Victorious Army" (Blackwood, 1868),
speaks with much contempt of Lin-Le's book. In a note (page 389) he
brings, certain charges against the author. Mr. Wilson's book is written to
glorify Gordon, Wood, and others, who accepted roving commissions against
the Ti-Pings; and of course he takes their view of the insurrection. The
accusations he brings against Lin-Le, even if correct, do not detract from
the apparent accuracy of that writer's story, nor from the weight of his
arguments.

[33] All Indian dates older than 300 B.C. are uncertain. The reasons for
this one are given carefully and in full by Pictet.

[34] Our English word _daughter_, together with the Greek [Greek:
thygater], the Zend _dughdar_, the Persian _docktar_, &c., corresponds
with the Sanskrit _duhitar_, which means both daughter and milkmaid.

_tosh_, Greek [Greek: tochos], Irish _tuagh_, Old German _deksa_,
Polish _tasalc_, Russian _tesaku._ And what is remarkable, the root _tak_
appears in the name of the hatchet in the languages of the South Sea
Islanders and the North American Indians.

[36] M. Vivien de Saint-Martin has determined more precisely than has been
done before the primitive country of the Aryans, and the route followed by
them in penetrating into India. They descended through Cabul to the
Punjaub, having previously reached Cabul from the region between the
Jaxartes and the Oxus.

[37] The Rig-Veda distinguishes the Aryans from the Dasjus. Mr. Muir
quotes a multitude of texts in which Indra is called upon to protect the
former and slay the latter.

[40] Mueller's Ancient Sanskrit Literature, page 569. He adds the following
remarks: "There is nothing to prove that this hymn is of a particularly
ancient date. On the contrary, there are expressions in it which seem to
belong to a later age. But even if we assign the lowest possible date to
this and similar hymns certain it is that they existed during the Mantra
period, and before the composition of the Brahmanas. For, to spite of all
the indications of a modern date, I see no possibility how we could
account for the allusions to it which occur in the Brahmanas, or for its
presence in the Sanhitas, unless we admit that this poem formed part of
the final collection of the Rig-veda-Sanhita, the work of the Mantra
period."

[46] That heat was "a form of motion" was thus early discovered.

scholars, that this code was never fully accepted or enforced in India,
and remained always an ideal of the perfect Brahmanic state.

[77] Even in the grammatical forms of the Sanskrit verb, this threefold
tendency of thought is indicated. It has an active, passive, and middle
voice (like that of the cognate Greek), and the reflex action of its
middle voice corresponds to the Restorer or Preserver.

[101] At the end of the fourth century of our era a Chinese Buddhist made
a pilgrimage to the birthplace of Buddha, and found the city in ruins.
Another Chinese pilgrim visited it A.D. 632, and was able to trace the
remains of the ruined palace, and saw a room which had been occupied by
Buddha. These travels have been translated from the Chinese by M.
Stanislas Julien.

[102] _Buddha_ is not a proper name, but an official title. Just as we
ought not to say Jesus Christ, but always Jesus _the_ Christ, so we should
say _Siddartha_ the Buddha, or _Sakya-muni_ the Buddha, or _Gautama_ the
Buddha. The first of these names, Siddartha (contracted from
_Sarvartha-siddha_) was the baptismal name given by his father, and means
"The fulfilment of every wish." Sakya-muni means "The hermit of the race
of Sakya,"--Sakya being the ancestral name of his father's race. The name
_Gautama_ is stated by Koeppen to be "der priesterliche Beiname des
Geschlechts der Sakya,"--whatever that may mean.

"to know."

This passage concerning Zoroaster is from the "Isis and Osiris" in Vol.
IV. of this old translation. We have retained the antique terminology and
spelling. (See also the new American edition of this translation. Boston,

[116] Kleuker (Anhang zum Zend Avesta) has given a full _resume_ of the
references to Zoroaster and his religion in the Greek and Roman writers.
More recently, Professor Bapp of Tubingen has gone over the same ground in
a very instructive essay in the Zeitschrift der Deutsohen Morgenlandisshen
Gesellschaft. (Leipzig, 1865.)

[117] Anq. du Perron, Zend Avesta; Disc. Prelim., p. vi.

[118] At the time Anquetil du Perron was thus laboring in the cause of
science in India, two other men were in the same region devoting
themselves with equal ardor to very different objects. Clive was laying
the foundations of the British dominion in India; Schwartz was giving
himself up to a life of toil in preaching the Gospel to the Hindoos. How
little would these three men have sympathized with each other, or
appreciated each other's work! And yet how important to the progress of
humanity was that of each!

[119] And with this conclusion the later scholars agree. Burnouf, Lassen,
Spiegel, Westergaard, Haug, Bunsen, Max Mueller, Roth, all accept the Zend
Avesta as containing in the main, if not the actual words of Zoroaster,
yet authentic reminiscences of his teaching. The Gathas of the Yacna are
now considered to be the oldest part of the Avesta, as appears from the
investigations of Haug and others. (See Dr. Martin Haug's translation and
