SAINTS, St. Ursula

Afar upon a foreign shore

Ancient Breton Melody
Arr. by N. A. M


Andante religioso

1.
Afar upon a foreign shore
A martyr's crown thy love did win,
Thy life, thy death to Jesus giv'n,
With Him to reign forevermore

Refrain
Hail Blessed Saint, hail Ursula!
Obtain for us, we pray,
That love may make us martyrs too,
And in our hearts hold sway.

2.
O happy Saint! Upon whose way
God's special love a glory cast,
Thy sorrows o'er thy tempest past,
Thou sharest His eternal day.

3.
To God the Father with the Son,
And Holy Spirit, Three in One,
Be glory while the ages flow,
From all above and all below.

SAINTS, St. Vincent de Paul

O blessed Father sent by God

Father Faber
Nicola A. Montani


Moderato

1.
O blessed Father! Sent by God
His mercy to dispense,
Thy hand is out o'er all the earth,
Like God's own providence.
There is no grief nor care of men,
Thou dost not own for thine,
No broken heart thou dost not fill
With mercy's oil and wine.

2.
Thy miracles are works of love,
Thy greatest is to make
Room in a day for toils that weeks
In other men would take.
All cries of suff'ring thro' the earth
Upon thy mercy call,
As tho' thou wert, like God himself,
A Father unto all.

3.
Dear Saint not in the wilderness
Thy fragrant virtues bloom,
But in the city's crowded haunts,
The alley's cheerless gloom.
When hunger hid itself to die,
Where guilt in darkness dwelt,
Thy pleasant sunshine can by stealth
Thy hand and heart were felt.

4.
For charity anointed thee
O'er want and woe and pain;
And she hath crowned thee emperor
Of all her wide domain.
Vincent! Like Mother Mary, thou
Art no one's patron saint;
Eyes to the blind, health to the sick,
And life to those who faint.

SAINTS, Feasts of Virgins

Dear Crown of all the Virgin-choir
Jesu, corona Virginum

For Unison, or Two-Part Chorus of Equal Voices
Translated by Father Caswall
P. Piel


Moderato

1.
Dear Crown of all the Virgin-choir
That holy Mother's Virgin Son!
Who is, alone of womankind,
Mother and Virgin both in one.

2.
Encircles by thy Virgin band,
Amid the lilies Thou art found;
For thy pure brides with lavish hand
Scatt'ring immortal graces round.

3.
And still whatever Thou dost bend
Thy lovely steps, O glorious King,
Virgins upon Thy steps attend,
And hymns to Thy glory sing.

4.
Keep us, O Purity divine,
From ev'ry least corruption free;
Our ev'ry sense from sin refine,
And purify our souls for Thee.

5.
To God the Father, and the Son,
All honor, glory, praise be giv'n;
With Thee, coequal Paraclete!
Forevermore in earth and Heav'n.

SAINTS, Feasts of Apostles

Now let the earth with joy resound
Exsultet orbis gaudiis

Translated by Father Caswall
Lachmannov Spevnicek
Arr. by N. A. M.


Joyously and with animation (alla breve)

1.
Now let the earth with joy resound;
And Heav'n the chant re-echo round;
Nor Heav'n nor earth too high can raise
The great Apostles' glorious praise.

2.
O ye who, throned in glory dread,
Shall judge the living and the dead!
Lights of the world forevermore!
To you the suppliant pray'r we pour.

3.
So when the world is at its end,
And Christ to judgement shall descend,
May we be called these joys to see
Prepared from all eternity.

4.
Praise to the Father, with the Son,
And Holy Spirit, Three in One;
As ever was in ages past,
And so shall be while ages last.

ANGELS

Hark! hark! my soul

The Pilgrims of the Night
Father Faber
Nicola A. Montani


Moderato (alla breve)

1.
Hark! Hark! My soul! Angelic songs are swelling
O'er earth's green fields and ocean's wave-beat shore;
How sweet the truth those blessed strains are telling
Of that new life where sin shall be no more!

Refrain
Angels of Jesus! Angels of light!
Singing to welcome The pilgrims of the night.

2.
Darker than night life's shadows fall around us,
And, like benighted men, we miss our mark;
God hides Himself, and grace hath scarcely found us,
Ere death finds out his victims in the dark.

3.
Far, far away, like bells at evening pealing,
The voice of Jesus sounds o'er land and sea;
And laden souls, by thousands meekly stealing,
Kind Shepherd! Turn their weary steps to Thee.

4.
Angels! sing on, your faithful watches keeping,
Sing us sweet fragments of the songs above;
While we toil on, and soothe ourselves with weeping,
Till life's long night shall break in endless love.

ANGELS

Dear Angel! ever at my side

The Guardian Angel
Father Faber
Nicola A. Montani


Semplice

1.
Dear angel! Ever at my side,
How loving must thou be,
To leave thy home in Heav'n
To guide a sinful child like me.

2.
Thy beautiful and shining face,
I see not, tho' so near;
The sweetness of thy soft low voice
Too deaf am I to hear.

3.
But when, dear Spirit, I kneel down,
Both morn and nigh to pray'r,
Something there is within my heart,
Which tells me thou art there.

4.
Oh! When I pray thou prayest too,
Thy pray'r is all for me;
But when I sleep, thou sleepest not,
But watchest patiently.

5.
Then, for thy sake, dear Angel! now
More humble will I be:
But I am weak, and when I fall,
O weary not of me.

6.
Then love me, love me, Angel dear!
And I will love thee more;
And help me when my soul is cast
Upon th'eternal shore.

THE HOLY SOULS

Help, Lord, the Souls which Thou hast made

The Faithful departed
Cardinal Newman
From a Slovak Hymnal
Arr. by N. A. M.


Andante

1.
Help, Lord, the souls which Thou hast made,
The souls to Thee so dear,
In prison for the debt unpaid,
Of sins committed here.

2.
These holy souls, they suffer on
Resigned in heart and will,
Until The high behest is done,
And justice has its fill.

3.
For daily falls, for pardoned crime
They joy to undergo
The shadow of Thy Cross sublime,
The remnant of Thy woe.

4.
Oh, by their patience of delay,
Their hope amid their pain,
Their sacred zeal to burn away
Disfigurement and stain.

5.
Oh, by their fire of love, not less
In keenness than in flame,
Oh, by their very helplessness,
Oh, by Thy own great Name.

6.
Good Jesus, help! Sweet Jesus, aid
The souls to Thee most dear,
In prison for the debt unpaid
Of sins committed here.

THE HOLY SOULS

Ye Souls of the Faithful
O vos fideles animae

Tr. by Father Caswall from an Italian Hymn Book
Arr. by N. A. M.


Moderato

1.
Ye souls of the faithful, who sleep in the Lord,
Who yet are shut out from your final reward:
O! would I could lend you assistance to fly
From prison below to your palace on high.

2.
O Father of mercies, Thine anger withhold;
These works of Thy Hand in Thy mercy behold:
Too oft from Thy path they have wandered aside,
But Thee, their Creator, they never denied.

3.
O tender Redeemer, their misery see:
Deliver the souls that were ransomed by Thee:
Behold how they love Thee, despite of their pain:
Restore them, restore them to favor again.

4.
O Spirit of Grace, Thou Consoler divine,
See how for Thy presence they longingly pine,
To lift, to enliven their sadness, descend;
And fill them with peace and with joy in the end.

THE HOLY SOULS

O turn to Jesus, Mother, turn

Father Faber
From a Slovak Hymnal
Arr. by N. A. M.


Lento

1.
O turn to Jesus, Mother! Turn,
And call Him by His tenderest names;
Pray for Holy Souls that burn
This hour amid the cleansing flames.

2.
Ah! They have fought a gallant fight;
In death's cold arms they persevered;
And after life's uncherry night,
The arbour of their rest is neared.

3.
They are the children of thy tears;
Then hasten, Mother, to their aid;
In pity think each hour appears
An age while glory is delayed.

4.
O Mary, let thy Son no more
His lingering Spouses thus expect:
God's children to their God restore,
And to the Spirit His elect.

5.
Pray, then, as thou hast ever prayed;
Angels and souls, all look to thee;
God waits thy pray'rs, for He hath made
Those pray'rs His law of charity.

He hath fought the gallant fight
Inter oves locum praesta,
Lead Him on to Heaven's light
Statuens in parte dextra.

THE HOLY SOULS

Out of the depths
De Profundis

S. Webbe


With devotion

1.
Out of the depths to Thee, O Lord, I cry,
Lord! Gracious turn Thine ear to suppliant sigh;
If sins of men Thou scann'st, who may stand
That searching eye of Thine, and chast'ning hand?

2.
Oh, bear our pray'rs and sighs, Redeemer blest,
And grant Thy holy souls eternal rest
And let perpetual light upon them shine;
For tho' not spotless, still these souls are Thine.

3.
To be appeased in wrath, dear Lord, is Thine;
Thou mercy with Thy justice canst combine;
Thy blood our countless stains can wash away:
This is Thy, law our hope and steadfast stay.

4.
This God Himself shall come from Heav'n above,
The Christ! The God of mercy and of love!
He comes, He comes! The God Incarnate He!
And by His glorious death makes all men free!

Jerusalem the Golden
Urbs Sion aurea

Bernard of Cluny
J. Grabowski
Translated by J. M. Neale
Arr. by N. A. M.


Con Moto

1.
Jerusalem the Golden,
With milk and honey blest,
Beneath thy contemplation
Sink heart and voice opprest;
I know not--Oh, I know not
What joys await us there;
What radiancy of glory,
What bliss beyond compare.

2.
They stand, those Halls of Sion,
