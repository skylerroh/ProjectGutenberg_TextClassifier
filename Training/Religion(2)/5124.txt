2 Esdr 10:41
Thou sawest a woman mourning, and thou begannest to comfort
her:

2 Esdr 10:42
But now seest thou the likeness of the woman no more, but
there appeared unto thee a city builded.

2 Esdr 10:43
And whereas she told thee of the death of her son, this is
the solution:

2 Esdr 10:44
This woman, whom thou sawest is Sion: and whereas she said
unto thee, even she whom thou seest as a city builded,

2 Esdr 10:45
Whereas, I say, she said unto thee, that she hath been thirty
years barren: those are the thirty years wherein there was no
offering made in her.

2 Esdr 10:46
But after thirty years Solomon builded the city and offered
offerings: and then bare the barren a son.

2 Esdr 10:47
And whereas she told thee that she nourished him with labour:
that was the dwelling in Jerusalem.

2 Esdr 10:48
But whereas she said unto thee, That my son coming into his
marriage chamber happened to have a fail, and died: this was the
destruction that came to Jerusalem.

2 Esdr 10:49
And, behold, thou sawest her likeness, and because she
mourned for her son, thou begannest to comfort her: and of these
things which have chanced, these are to be opened unto thee.

2 Esdr 10:50
For now the most High seeth that thou art grieved
unfeignedly, and sufferest from thy whole heart for her, so hath
he shewed thee the brightness of her glory, and the comeliness
of her beauty:

2 Esdr 10:51
And therefore I bade thee remain in the field where no house
was builded:

2 Esdr 10:52
For I knew that the Highest would shew this unto thee.

2 Esdr 10:53
Therefore I commanded thee to go into the field, where no
foundation of any building was.

2 Esdr 10:54
For in the place wherein the Highest beginneth to shew his
city, there can no man's building be able to stand.

2 Esdr 10:55
And therefore fear not, let not thine heart be affrighted,
but go thy way in, and see the beauty and greatness of the
building, as much as thine eyes be able to see:

2 Esdr 10:56
And then shalt thou hear as much as thine ears may
comprehend.

2 Esdr 10:57
For thou art blessed above many other, and art called with
the Highest; and so are but few.

2 Esdr 10:58
But to morrow at night thou shalt remain here;

2 Esdr 10:59
And so shall the Highest shew thee visions of the high
things, which the most High will do unto them that dwell upon
the earth in the last days. So I slept that night and another,
like as he commanded me.

2 Esdr 11:1
Then saw I a dream, and, behold, there came up from the sea
an eagle, which had twelve feathered wings, and three heads.

2 Esdr 11:2
And I saw, and, behold, she spread her wings over all the
earth, and all the winds of the air blew on her, and were
gathered together.

2 Esdr 11:3
And I beheld, and out of her feathers there grew other
contrary feathers; and they became little feathers and small.

2 Esdr 11:4
But her heads were at rest: the head in the midst was greater
than the other, yet rested it with the residue.

2 Esdr 11:5
Moreover I beheld, and, lo, the eagle flew with her feathers,
and reigned upon earth, and over them that dwelt therein.

2 Esdr 11:6
And I saw that all things under heaven were subject unto her,
and no man spake against her, no, not one creature upon earth.

2 Esdr 11:7
And I beheld, and, lo, the eagle rose upon her talons, and
spake to her feathers, saying,

2 Esdr 11:8
Watch not all at once: sleep every one in his own place, and
watch by course:

2 Esdr 11:9
But let the heads be preserved for the last.

2 Esdr 11:10
And I beheld, and, lo, the voice went not out of her heads,
but from the midst of her body.

2 Esdr 11:11
And I numbered her contrary feathers, and, behold, there were
eight of them.

2 Esdr 11:12
And I looked, and, behold, on the right side there arose one
feather, and reigned over all the earth;

2 Esdr 11:13
And so it was, that when it reigned, the end of it came, and
the place thereof appeared no more: so the next following stood
up, and reigned, and had a great time;

2 Esdr 11:14
And it happened, that when it reigned, the end of it came
also, like as the first, so that it appeared no more.

2 Esdr 11:15
Then came there a voice unto it, and said,

2 Esdr 11:16
Hear thou that hast borne rule over the earth so long: this I
say unto thee, before thou beginnest to appear no more,

2 Esdr 11:17
There shall none after thee attain unto thy time, neither
unto the half thereof.

2 Esdr 11:18
Then arose the third, and reigned as the other before, and
appeared no more also.

2 Esdr 11:19
So went it with all the residue one after another, as that
every one reigned, and then appeared no more.

2 Esdr 11:20
Then I beheld, and, lo, in process of time the feathers that
followed stood up upon the right side, that they might rule
also; and some of them ruled, but within a while they appeared
no more:

2 Esdr 11:21
For some of them were set up, but ruled not.

2 Esdr 11:22
After this I looked, and, behold, the twelve feathers
appeared no more, nor the two little feathers:

2 Esdr 11:23
And there was no more upon the eagle's body, but three heads
that rested, and six little wings.

2 Esdr 11:24
Then saw I also that two little feathers divided themselves
from the six, and remained under the head that was upon the
right side: for the four continued in their place.

2 Esdr 11:25
And I beheld, and, lo, the feathers that were under the wing
thought to set up themselves and to have the rule.

2 Esdr 11:26
And I beheld, and, lo, there was one set up, but shortly it
appeared no more.

2 Esdr 11:27
And the second was sooner away than the first.

2 Esdr 11:28
And I beheld, and, lo, the two that remained thought also in
themselves to reign:

2 Esdr 11:29
And when they so thought, behold, there awaked one of the
heads that were at rest, namely, it that was in the midst; for
that was greater than the two other heads.

2 Esdr 11:30
And then I saw that the two other heads were joined with it.

2 Esdr 11:31
And, behold, the head was turned with them that were with it,
and did eat up the two feathers under the wing that would have
reigned.

2 Esdr 11:32
But this head put the whole earth in fear, and bare rule in
it over all those that dwelt upon the earth with much
oppression; and it had the governance of the world more than all
the wings that had been.

2 Esdr 11:33
And after this I beheld, and, lo, the head that was in the
midst suddenly appeared no more, like as the wings.

2 Esdr 11:34
But there remained the two heads, which also in like sort
ruled upon the earth, and over those that dwelt therein.

2 Esdr 11:35
And I beheld, and, lo, the head upon the right side devoured
it that was upon the left side.

2 Esdr 11:36
Then I head a voice, which said unto me, Look before thee,
and consider the thing that thou seest.

2 Esdr 11:37
And I beheld, and lo, as it were a roaring lion chased out of
the wood: and I saw that he sent out a man's voice unto the
eagle, and said,

2 Esdr 11:38
Hear thou, I will talk with thee, and the Highest shall say
unto thee,

2 Esdr 11:39
Art not thou it that remainest of the four beasts, whom I
made to reign in my world, that the end of their times might
come through them?

2 Esdr 11:40
And the fourth came, and overcame all the beasts that were
past, and had power over the world with great fearfulness, and
over the whole compass of the earth with much wicked oppression;
and so long time dwelt he upon the earth with deceit.

2 Esdr 11:41
For the earth hast thou not judged with truth.

2 Esdr 11:42
For thou hast afflicted the meek, thou hast hurt the
peaceable, thou hast loved liars, and destroyed the dwellings of
them that brought forth fruit, and hast cast down the walls of
such as did thee no harm.

2 Esdr 11:43
Therefore is thy wrongful dealing come up unto the Highest,
and thy pride unto the Mighty.

2 Esdr 11:44
The Highest also hath looked upon the proud times, and,
behold, they are ended, and his abominations are fulfilled.

2 Esdr 11:45
And therefore appear no more, thou eagle, nor thy horrible
wings, nor thy wicked feathers nor thy malicious heads, nor thy
hurtful claws, nor all thy vain body:

2 Esdr 11:46
That all the earth may be refreshed, and may return, being
delivered from thy violence, and that she may hope for the
judgment and mercy of him that made her.

2 Esdr 12:1
And it came to pass, whiles the lion spake these words unto
the eagle, I saw,

2 Esdr 12:2
And, behold, the head that remained and the four wings
appeared no more, and the two went unto it and set themselves up
to reign, and their kingdom was small, and fill of uproar.

2 Esdr 12:3
And I saw, and, behold, they appeared no more, and the whole
body of the eagle was burnt so that the earth was in great fear:
then awaked I out of the trouble and trance of my mind, and from
great fear, and said unto my spirit,

2 Esdr 12:4
Lo, this hast thou done unto me, in that thou searchest out
the ways of the Highest.

2 Esdr 12:5
Lo, yet am I weary in my mind, and very weak in my spirit;
and little strength is there in me, for the great fear wherewith
I was afflicted this night.

2 Esdr 12:6
Therefore will I now beseech the Highest, that he will
comfort me unto the end.

2 Esdr 12:7
And I said, Lord that bearest rule, if I have found grace
before thy sight, and if I am justified with thee before many
others, and if my prayer indeed be come up before thy face;

2 Esdr 12:8
Comfort me then, and shew me thy servant the interpretation
and plain difference of this fearful vision, that thou mayest
perfectly comfort my soul.

2 Esdr 12:9
For thou hast judged me worthy to shew me the last times.

2 Esdr 12:10
And he said unto me, This is the interpretation of the
vision:

2 Esdr 12:11
The eagle, whom thou sawest come up from the sea, is the
kingdom which was seen in the vision of thy brother Daniel.

2 Esdr 12:12
But it was not expounded unto him, therefore now I declare it
unto thee.

2 Esdr 12:13
Behold, the days will come, that there shall rise up a
kingdom upon earth, and it shall be feared above all the
kingdoms that were before it.

2 Esdr 12:14
In the same shall twelve kings reign, one after another:

2 Esdr 12:15
Whereof the second shall begin to reign, and shall have more
time than any of the twelve.

2 Esdr 12:16
And this do the twelve wings signify, which thou sawest.

2 Esdr 12:17
As for the voice which thou heardest speak, and that thou
sawest not to go out from the heads but from the midst of the
body thereof, this is the interpretation:

2 Esdr 12:18
That after the time of that kingdom there shall arise great
strivings, and it shall stand in peril of failing: nevertheless
it shall not then fall, but shall be restored again to his
beginning.

2 Esdr 12:19
And whereas thou sawest the eight small under feathers
sticking to her wings, this is the interpretation:

2 Esdr 12:20
That in him there shall arise eight kings, whose times shall
be but small, and their years swift.

2 Esdr 12:21
And two of them shall perish, the middle time approaching:
four shall be kept until their end begin to approach: but two
shall be kept unto the end.

2 Esdr 12:22
And whereas thou sawest three heads resting, this is the
interpretation:

2 Esdr 12:23
In his last days shall the most High raise up three kingdoms,
and renew many things therein, and they shall have the dominion
of the earth,

2 Esdr 12:24
And of those that dwell therein, with much oppression, above
all those that were before them: therefore are they called the
heads of the eagle.

2 Esdr 12:25
For these are they that shall accomplish his wickedness, and
that shall finish his last end.

2 Esdr 12:26
And whereas thou sawest that the great head appeared no more,
it signifieth that one of them shall die upon his bed, and yet
with pain.

2 Esdr 12:27
For the two that remain shall be slain with the sword.

2 Esdr 12:28
For the sword of the one shall devour the other: but at the
last shall he fall through the sword himself.

2 Esdr 12:29
And whereas thou sawest two feathers under the wings passing
over the head that is on the right side;

2 Esdr 12:30
It signifieth that these are they, whom the Highest hath kept
unto their end: this is the small kingdom and full of trouble,
as thou sawest.

2 Esdr 12:31
And the lion, whom thou sawest rising up out of the wood, and
roaring, and speaking to the eagle, and rebuking her for her
unrighteousness with all the words which thou hast heard;

2 Esdr 12:32
This is the anointed, which the Highest hath kept for them
and for their wickedness unto the end: he shall reprove them,
and shall upbraid them with their cruelty.

2 Esdr 12:33
For he shall set them before him alive in judgment, and shall
rebuke them, and correct them.

2 Esdr 12:34
For the rest of my people shall he deliver with mercy, those
that have been pressed upon my borders, and he shall make them
joyful until the coming of the day of judgment, whereof I have
spoken unto thee from the the beginning.

2 Esdr 12:35
This is the dream that thou sawest, and these are the
interpretations.

2 Esdr 12:36
Thou only hast been meet to know this secret of the Highest.

2 Esdr 12:37
Therefore write all these things that thou hast seen in a
book, and hide them:

2 Esdr 12:38
And teach them to the wise of the people, whose hearts thou
knowest may comprehend and keep these secrets.

2 Esdr 12:39
But wait thou here thyself yet seven days more, that it may
be shewed thee, whatsoever it pleaseth the Highest to declare
unto thee. And with that he went his way.

2 Esdr 12:40
And it came to pass, when all the people saw that the seven
days were past, and I not come again into the city, they
gathered them all together, from the least unto the greatest,
and came unto me, and said,

2 Esdr 12:41
What have we offended thee? and what evil have we done
against thee, that thou forsakest us, and sittest here in this
place?

2 Esdr 12:42
For of all the prophets thou only art left us, as a cluster
of the vintage, and as a candle in a dark place, and as a haven
or ship preserved from the tempest.

2 Esdr 12:43
Are not the evils which are come to us sufficient?

2 Esdr 12:44
If thou shalt forsake us, how much better had it been for us,
if we also had been burned in the midst of Sion?

2 Esdr 12:45
For we are not better than they that died there. And they
wept with a loud voice. Then answered I them, and said,

2 Esdr 12:46
Be of good comfort, O Israel; and be not heavy, thou house of
Jacob:

2 Esdr 12:47
For the Highest hath you in remembrance, and the Mighty hath
not forgotten you in temptation.

2 Esdr 12:48
As for me, I have not forsaken you, neither am I departed
from you: but am come into this place, to pray for the
desolation of Sion, and that I might seek mercy for the low
estate of your sanctuary.

2 Esdr 12:49
And now go your way home every man, and after these days will
I come unto you.

2 Esdr 12:50
So the people went their way into the city, like as I
commanded them:

2 Esdr 12:51
But I remained still in the field seven days, as the angel
commanded me; and did eat only in those days of the flowers of
the field, and had my meat of the herbs

2 Esdr 13:1
And it came to pass after seven days, I dreamed a dream by
night:

2 Esdr 13:2
And, lo, there arose a wind from the sea, that it moved all
the waves thereof.

2 Esdr 13:3
And I beheld, and, lo, that man waxed strong with the
thousands of heaven: and when he turned his countenance to look,
all the things trembled that were seen under him.

2 Esdr 13:4
And whensoever the voice went out of his mouth, all they
burned that heard his voice, like as the earth faileth when it
feeleth the fire.

2 Esdr 13:5
And after this I beheld, and, lo, there was gathered together
a multitude of men, out of number, from the four winds of the
heaven, to subdue the man that came out of the sea

2 Esdr 13:6
But I beheld, and, lo, he had graved himself a great
mountain, and flew up upon it.

2 Esdr 13:7
But I would have seen the region or place whereout the hill
was graven, and I could not.

2 Esdr 13:8
And after this I beheld, and, lo, all they which were
gathered together to subdue him were sore afraid, and yet durst
fight.

2 Esdr 13:9
And, lo, as he saw the violence of the multitude that came,
he neither lifted up his hand, nor held sword, nor any
instrument of war:

2 Esdr 13:10
But only I saw that he sent out of his mouth as it had been a
blast of fire, and out of his lips a flaming breath, and out of
his tongue he cast out sparks and tempests.

2 Esdr 13:11
And they were all mixed together; the blast of fire, the
flaming breath, and the great tempest; and fell with violence
upon the multitude which was prepared to fight, and burned them
up every one, so that upon a sudden of an innumerable multitude
nothing was to be perceived, but only dust and smell of smoke:
when I saw this I was afraid.

2 Esdr 13:12
Afterward saw I the same man come down from the mountain, and
call unto him another peaceable Multitude.

2 Esdr 13:13
And there came much people unto him, whereof some were glad,
some were sorry, and some of them were bound, and other some
brought of them that were offered: then was I sick through great
fear, and I awaked, and said,

2 Esdr 13:14
Thou hast shewed thy servant these wonders from the
beginning, and hast counted me worthy that thou shouldest
receive my prayer:

2 Esdr 13:15
Shew me now yet the interpretation of this dream.

2 Esdr 13:16
For as I conceive in mine understanding, woe unto them that
shall be left in those days and much more woe unto them that are
not left behind!

2 Esdr 13:17
For they that were not left were in heaviness.

2 Esdr 13:18
Now understand I the things that are laid up in the latter
days, which shall happen unto them, and to those that are left
behind.

2 Esdr 13:19
Therefore are they come into great perils and many
necessities, like as these dreams declare.

2 Esdr 13:20
Yet is it easier for him that is in danger to come into these
things, than to pass away as a cloud out of the world, and not
to see the things that happen in the last days. And he answered
unto me, and said,

2 Esdr 13:21
The interpretation of the vision shall I shew thee, and I
will open unto thee the thing that thou hast required.

2 Esdr 13:22
Whereas thou hast spoken of them that are left behind, this
is the interpretation:

2 Esdr 13:23
He that shall endure the peril in that time hath kept
himself: they that be fallen into danger are such as have works,
and faith toward the Almighty.

2 Esdr 13:24
Know this therefore, that they which be left behind are more
blessed than they that be dead.

2 Esdr 13:25
This is the meaning of the vision: Whereas thou sawest a man
coming up from the midst of the sea:

2 Esdr 13:26
The same is he whom God the Highest hath kept a great season,
which by his own self shall deliver his creature: and he shall
order them that are left behind.

2 Esdr 13:27
And whereas thou sawest, that out of his mouth there came as
a blast of wind, and fire, and storm;

2 Esdr 13:28
And that he held neither sword, nor any instrument of war,
but that the rushing in of him destroyed the whole multitude
that came to subdue him; this is the interpretation:

2 Esdr 13:29
Behold, the days come, when the most High will begin to
deliver them that are upon the earth.

2 Esdr 13:30
And he shall come to the astonishment of them that dwell on
the earth.

2 Esdr 13:31
And one shall undertake to fight against another, one city
against another, one place against another, one people against
another, and one realm against another.

2 Esdr 13:32
And the time shall be when these things shall come to pass,
and the signs shall happen which I shewed thee before, and then
shall my Son be declared, whom thou sawest as a man ascending.

2 Esdr 13:33
And when all the people hear his voice, every man shall in
their own land leave the battle they have one against another.

2 Esdr 13:34
And an innumerable multitude shall be gathered together, as
thou sawest them, willing to come, and to overcome him by
fighting.

2 Esdr 13:35
But he shall stand upon the top of the mount Sion.

2 Esdr 13:36
And Sion shall come, and shall be shewed to all men, being
prepared and builded, like as thou sawest the hill graven
without hands.

2 Esdr 13:37
And this my Son shall rebuke the wicked inventions of those
nations, which for their wicked life are fallen into the
tempest;

2 Esdr 13:38
And shall lay before them their evil thoughts, and the
torments wherewith they shall begin to be tormented, which are
like unto a flame: and he shall destroy them without labour by
the law which is like unto me.

2 Esdr 13:39
And whereas thou sawest that he gathered another peaceable
multitude unto him;

2 Esdr 13:40
Those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisoners
out of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom
Salmanasar the king of Assyria led away captive, and he carried
them over the waters, and so came they into another land.

2 Esdr 13:41
But they took this counsel among themselves, that they would
leave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into a further
country, where never mankind dwelt,

2 Esdr 13:42
That they might there keep their statutes, which they never
kept in their own land.

2 Esdr 13:43
And they entered into Euphrates by the narrow places of the
river.

2 Esdr 13:44
For the most High then shewed signs for them, and held still
the flood, till they were passed over.

2 Esdr 13:45
For through that country there was a great way to go, namely,
of a year and a half: and the same region is called Arsareth.

2 Esdr 13:46
Then dwelt they there until the latter time; and now when
they shall begin to come,

2 Esdr 13:47
The Highest shall stay the springs of the stream again, that
they may go through: therefore sawest thou the multitude with
peace.

2 Esdr 13:48
But those that be left behind of thy people are they that are
found within my borders.

2 Esdr 13:49
Now when he destroyeth the multitude of the nations that are
gathered together, he shall defend his people that remain.

2 Esdr 13:50
And then shall he shew them great wonders.

2 Esdr 13:51
Then said I, O Lord that bearest rule, shew me this:
Wherefore have I seen the man coming up from the midst of the
sea?

2 Esdr 13:52
And he said unto me, Like as thou canst neither seek out nor
know the things that are in the deep of the sea: even so can no
man upon earth see my Son, or those that be with him, but in the
day time.

2 Esdr 13:53
This is the interpretation of the dream which thou sawest,
and whereby thou only art here lightened.

2 Esdr 13:54
For thou hast forsaken thine own way, and applied thy
diligence unto my law, and sought it.

2 Esdr 13:55
Thy life hast thou ordered in wisdom, and hast called
understanding thy mother.

2 Esdr 13:56
And therefore have I shewed thee the treasures of the
Highest: after other three days I will speak other things unto
thee, and declare unto thee mighty and wondrous things.

2 Esdr 13:57
Then went I forth into the field, giving praise and thanks
greatly unto the most High because of his wonders which he did
in time;

2 Esdr 13:58
And because he governeth the same, and such things as fall in
their seasons: and there I sat three days.

2 Esdr 14:1
And it came to pass upon the third day, I sat under an oak,
and, behold, there came a voice out of a bush over against me,
and said, Esdras, Esdras.

2 Esdr 14:2
And I said, Here am I, Lord And I stood up upon my feet.

2 Esdr 14:3
Then said he unto me, In the bush I did manifestly reveal
myself unto Moses, and talked with him, when my people served in
Egypt:

2 Esdr 14:4
And I sent him and led my people out of Egypt, and brought
him up to the mount of where I held him by me a long season,

2 Esdr 14:5
And told him many wondrous things, and shewed him the secrets
of the times, and the end; and commanded him, saying,

2 Esdr 14:6
These words shalt thou declare, and these shalt thou hide.

2 Esdr 14:7
And now I say unto thee,

2 Esdr 14:8
That thou lay up in thy heart the signs that I have shewed,
and the dreams that thou hast seen, and the interpretations
which thou hast heard:

2 Esdr 14:9
For thou shalt be taken away from all, and from henceforth
thou shalt remain with my Son, and with such as be like thee,
until the times be ended.

2 Esdr 14:10
For the world hath lost his youth, and the times begin to wax
old.

2 Esdr 14:11
For the world is divided into twelve parts, and the ten parts
of it are gone already, and half of a tenth part:

2 Esdr 14:12
And there remaineth that which is after the half of the tenth
part.

2 Esdr 14:13
Now therefore set thine house in order, and reprove thy
people, comfort such of them as be in trouble, and now renounce
corruption,

2 Esdr 14:14
Let go from thee mortal thoughts, cast away the burdens of
man, put off now the weak nature,

2 Esdr 14:15
And set aside the thoughts that are most heavy unto thee, and
haste thee to flee from these times.

2 Esdr 14:16
For yet greater evils than those which thou hast seen happen
shall be done hereafter.

2 Esdr 14:17
For look how much the world shall be weaker through age, so
much the more shall evils increase upon them that dwell therein.

2 Esdr 14:18
For the time is fled far away, and leasing is hard at hand:
for now hasteth the vision to come, which thou hast seen.

2 Esdr 14:19
Then answered I before thee, and said,

2 Esdr 14:20
Behold, Lord, I will go, as thou hast commanded me, and
reprove the people which are present: but they that shall be
born afterward, who shall admonish them? thus the world is set
in darkness, and they that dwell therein are without light.

2 Esdr 14:21
For thy law is burnt, therefore no man knoweth the things
that are done of thee, or the work that shall begin.

2 Esdr 14:22
But if I have found grace before thee, send the Holy Ghost
into me, and I shall write all that hath been done in the world
since the beginning, which were written in thy law, that men may
find thy path, and that they which will live in the latter days
may live.

2 Esdr 14:23
And he answered me, saying, Go thy way, gather the people
together, and say unto them, that they seek thee not for forty
days.

2 Esdr 14:24
But look thou prepare thee many box trees, and take with thee
Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ecanus, and Asiel, these five which are
ready to write swiftly;

2 Esdr 14:25
And come hither, and I shall light a candle of understanding
in thine heart, which shall not be put out, till the things be
performed which thou shalt begin to write.

2 Esdr 14:26
And when thou hast done, some things shalt thou publish, and
some things shalt thou shew secretly to the wise: to morrow this
hour shalt thou begin to write.

2 Esdr 14:27
Then went I forth, as he commanded, and gathered all the
people together, and said,

2 Esdr 14:28
Hear these words, O Israel.

2 Esdr 14:29
Our fathers at the beginning were strangers in Egypt, from
whence they were delivered:

2 Esdr 14:30
And received the law of life, which they kept not, which ye
also have transgressed after them.

2 Esdr 14:31
Then was the land, even the land of Sion, parted among you by
lot: but your fathers, and ye yourselves, have done
unrighteousness, and have not kept the ways which the Highest
