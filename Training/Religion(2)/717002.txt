work of all the Churches of the Presbyterian order in all parts of the
world. Oh that our Church might take the lead in this catholicity of
spirit--instead of falling back in the opposite direction--that no one
may take her crown! But if she do not, then we trust that some other of
the sacramental hosts will take the lead and receive too the honor, for
it is for the glory of the great Captain of our salvation, and for the
interests of His kingdom. We need the united strength of all these
branches of Zion for the great work, which the Master has set before us,
in calling on us to evangelize the world. In expecting to obtain this
union, will it be said, that we are looking for a chimera? It ought to
be so, ought it not? Then it is no chimera. It may take time for the
churches to come up to this standard, but within a few years past we
have seen tendencies to union among different branches of the
Presbyterian family in Australia, in Canada, in our own country, and in
England and Scotland. In many places these tendencies are stronger now
than they have ever before been since the days of the Reformation. True,
human nature is still compassed with infirmities even in the Church of
Christ. But the day of the world's regeneration is approaching, and as
it approaches nearer to us, doubtless the different branches of the
Presbyterian family will approach still nearer to each other. God hasten
the time, and keep us also from doing anything to retard, but everything
to help it forward, and to his name be the praise forever. Amen.




Appendix A.


Further to illustrate the unity of the Churches under the care of the
two Missions, I will transcribe from the _Reports_ of the Amoy Mission,
for the years 1861 and 1862.


_From the Report for 1861_. Dated Feb. 24. 1862.

Our work is so interwoven with that of the Missionaries of the English
Presbyterian Church, that we cannot give a full report of the state of
our Churches and out-stations without including in it a partial report
of some of their stations. We have, therefore, thought it best, both on
this account, and because the Churches gathered by us and by them are
really one, to give statistics of both Missions with brief remarks.
These, besides simplifying the matter, will enable the Church at home to
become better acquainted with the real progress of the cause of Christ
in this region.

_Remarks on the above Tabular View_.

The two Churches at Amoy, and the one at Chioh-be are under the care of
the Missionaries of the Reformed Dutch Church. *  *  *  *  *  *

The Churches at Peh-chui-ia and Ma-peng, are under the care of the
Missionaries of the English Presbyterian Church. *  *  *  *  *  *

The Congregation at An-hai is under the care of the English
Presbyterian Missionaries. It has not yet been organized into a Church.
It is so far removed from Amoy that it cannot conveniently be placed
under the supervision of either of the Consistories. * * * * * *

Khang-khau is a station under the care of the English Presbyterian
Mission. * * * * * *

Kang-thau is under the care of the Reformed Dutch Mission.

E-mng-kang is a suburb of Amoy. The Congregation worshiping there
belongs, mostly, to the First Church at Amoy. The Station is under the
care of the English Presbyterian Mission. * * * * * *

Chiang-chiu is a large city, some twelve miles or more beyond Chioh-be,
and about thirty-five miles from Amoy. In times past, several efforts
have been made to establish a Station at Chiang-chiu, but always without
success, until during the past year. At the close of the year there had
not yet been any baptisms at that Station. Since the beginning of this
year, there have been several. The Church members are reckoned to the
Church at Chioh-be, and are under the oversight of the Chioh-be
Consistory. Both Missions work as one at Chiang-chiu. Each Mission is to
furnish half the expense. To simplify the work, it was thought best that
one Mission be responsible for the control of the Station, and direct
the work. At present this is the Mission of the Reformed Dutch Church.
If the work be prospered, it is proposed to form two Stations, one under
the care of each Mission.

[Of the three new Stations, Go-chhng and Te-soa, are under the care of
the Reformed Dutch Mission, Khi-be under the care of the English
Presbyterian Mission. The other Churches and Stations as in previous
Report.]

The Board of Foreign Missions, being simply the organ of Synod, felt
bound in their Report to eliminate, as far as possible, all the
Presbyterian elements from the above Reports of the Mission. By so
doing, we think that they, _undesignedly_ of course, keep our Church in
ignorance, not only of the absolute unity of the Churches in the region
of Amoy, but also of the real progress of the cause of Christ and of the
Church of our order there. Among the members set down to our churches
are those who belong to stations under the care of the English
Presbyterian Mission, as is shown by the Tabular Views. The Church at
home, not aware of this fact, gives to their Mission credit which does
not belong to them; and then, when, in the progress of the work, new
churches are organized at these stations, and these members are set off
to them, because they belong there, the Dutch Mission is charged with
deficiency of denominational feeling, in giving to the English
Presbyterians that which, "by all rules of Christian courtesy and
harmonious Missionary action," belongs to the Dutch Church. Is it well
that we should be disputing among ourselves concerning who shall have
that credit which all belongs to Christ? I know it has been asked, with
disapprobation, by very high authority (not, indeed, by the Board)
concerning the unity of the Churches at Amoy--"_how it came to exist at
all_." In answer to such questions, let us consider one case, that of
the Station, now Church, at E-mng-kang. It is near enough to the First
Church, at Amoy, to be under its supervision. Doubtless, we might have
said to our Presbyterian brethren, In gathering a church, we are willing
to labor with you in preaching the Gospel, for no one will censure us
for that, and we admit that, by all principles of our Church order, it
would be altogether proper that the converts gathered in at E-mng-kang
should be received and watched over by the First Church, at Amoy; but,
by allowing this, there will be danger of unity between the Christians
at E-mng-kang and Amoy ("that they all may be one"), which will be a
violation of the important and radical distinction existing between
them, because "some are supported by our funds, some by the funds of the
English Presbyterians;" and then, when it becomes necessary to divide
these Churches, for where there is such a radical distinction, "a
division will necessarily come at some period, and the longer it is
delayed, the more trying and sorrowful it will be," it will be found
that the Church at Amoy can never "relinquish its powers and abnegate
its authority" over the Church at E-mng-kang--therefore, rather than
incur such risks of unity, we had better violate our principles of
Church order at the commencement, and not allow the native Elders any
responsibility in receiving and watching over the Church members. We
might have acted on such principles, but shall we be _censured_ for not
doing it?

Let it be distinctly understood, that I do not publish the above
Reports with such remarks with any design of throwing blame on the Board
of Foreign Missions. The members of it, and the Missionaries, have had
no feelings towards each other but such as are altogether pleasant.
Perhaps the Board, in view of all the circumstances, has simply
performed its duty. I add this Appendix only to illustrate the unity of
the churches at Amoy, and show that the Missionaries have acted
according to the doctrines of God's Word and the fundamental principles
of our Church order.
