  fore protinus omnia viva,
  quae nunc gelidus sopor urget.      60

    Qui iacta cadavera passim
  miserans tegit aggere terrae,
  opus exhibet ille benignum
  Christo pius omnipotenti:

    Quin lex eadem monet omnes        65
  gemitum dare sorte sub una,
  cognataque funera nobis
  aliena in morte dolere.

    Sancti sator ille Tobiae
  sacer ac venerabilis heros,         70
  dapibus iam rite paratis
  ius praetulit exequiarum.

    Iam stantibus ille ministris
  cyathos et fercula liquit,
  studioque accinctus humandi         75
  fleto dedit ossa sepulcro.

    Veniunt mox praemia caelo
  pretiumque rependitur ingens:
  nam lumina nescia solis
  Deus inlita felle serenat.          80

    Iam tunc docuit Pater orbis,
  quam sit rationis egenis
  mordax et amara medela,
  cum lux animum nova vexat.

    Docuit quoque non prius ullum     85
  caelestia cernere regna,
  quam nocte et vulnere tristi
  toleraverit aspera mundi.

    Mors ipsa beatior inde est,
  quod per cruciamina leti            90
  via panditur ardua iustis
  et ad astra doloribus itur.

    Sic corpora mortificata
  redeunt melioribus annis,
  nec post obitum recalescens         95
  conpago fatiscere novit.

    Haec, quae modo pallida tabo
  color albidus inficit ora,
  tunc flore venustior omni
  sanguis cute tinget amoena.        100

    Iam nulla deinde senectus
  frontis decus invida carpet,
  macies neque sicca lacertos
  suco tenuabit adeso.

    Morbus quoque pestifer, artus    105
  qui nunc populatur anhelos,
  sua tunc tormenta resudans
  luet inter vincula mille.

    Hunc eminus aere ab alto
  victrix caro iamque perennis       110
  cernet sine fine gementem
  quos moverat ipse dolores.

    Quid turba superstes inepta
  clangens ululamina miscet,
  cur tam bene condita iura          115
  luctu dolor arguit amens?

    Iam maesta quiesce querela,
  lacrimas suspendite matres,
  nullus sua pignora plangat,
  mors haec reparatio vitae est.     120

    Sic semina sicca virescunt
  iam mortua iamque sepulta,
  quae reddita caespite ab imo
  veteres meditantur aristas.

    Nunc suscipe terra fovendum,     125
  gremioque hunc concipe molli:
  hominis tibi membra sequestro
  generosa et fragmina credo.

    Animae fuit haec domus olim
  factoris ab ore creatae,           130
  fervens habitavit in istis
  sapientia principe Christo.

    Tu depositum tege corpus,
  non inmemor illa requiret
  sua munera fictor et auctor        135
  propriique aenigmata vultus.

    Veniant modo tempora iusta,
  cum spem Deus inpleat omnem;
  reddas patefacta necesse est,
  qualem tibi trado figuram.         140

    Non, si cariosa vetustas
  dissolverit ossa favillis,
  fueritque cinisculus arens
  minimi mensura pugilli.

    Nec, si vaga flamina et aurae    145
  vacuum per inane volantes
  tulerint cum pulvere nervos,
  hominem periisse licebit.

    Sed dum resolubile corpus
  revocas, Deus, atque reformas,     150
  quanam regione iubebis
  animam requiescere puram?

    Gremio senis addita sancti
  recubabit, ut est Eleazar,
  quem floribus undique septum       155
  Dives procul adspicit ardens.

    Sequimur tua dicta redemptor,
  quibus atra morte triumphans
  tua per vestigia mandas
  socium crucis ire latronem.        160

    Patet ecce fidelibus ampli
  via lucida iam paradisi,
  licet et nemus illud adire,
  homini quod ademerat anguis.

    Illic precor, optime ductor,     165
  famulam tibi praecipe mentem
  genitali in sede sacrari,
  quam liquerat exul et errans.

    Nos tecta fovebimus ossa
  violis et fronde frequenti,        170
  titulumque et frigida saxa
  liquido spargemus odore.




                  X. HYMN FOR THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD


  Fountain of life, supernal Fire,
    Who didst unite in wondrous wise
    The soul that lives, the clay that dies,
  And mad'st them Man: eternal Sire,

  Both elements Thy will obey,
    Thine is the bond that joins the twain,
    And, while united they remain,
  Spirit and body own Thy sway.

  Yet they must one day disunite,
    Sunder in death this mortal frame;
    Dust to the dust from whence it came,
  The spirit to its heavenward flight.

  For all created things must wane,
    And age must break the bond at last;
    The diverse web that Life held fast
  Death's fingers shall unweave again.

  Yet, gracious God, Thou dost devise
    The death of Death for all Thine own;
    The path of safety Thou hast shown
  Whereby the doomed limbs may rise:

  So that, while fragile bonds of earth
    Man's noblest essence still enfold,
    That part may yet the sceptre hold
  Which from pure aether hath its birth.

  For if the earthy will hold sway,
    By gross desires and aims possessed,
    The soul, too, by the weight oppressed,
  Follows the body's downward way.

  But if she scorn the guilt that mars--
    Still mindful of her fiery sphere--
    She bears the flesh, her comrade here,
  Back to her home beyond the stars.

  The lifeless body we restore
    To earth, must slumber free from pain
    A little while, that it may gain
  The spirit's fellowship once more.

  The years will pass with rapid pace
    Till through these limbs the life shall flow,
    And the long-parted spirit go
  To seek her olden dwelling-place.

  Then shall the body, that hath lain
    And turned to dust in slow decay,
    On airy wings be borne away
  And join its ancient soul again.

  Therefore our tenderest care we spend
    Upon the grave: and mourners go
    With solemn dirge and footstep slow--
  Love's last sad tribute to a friend.

  With fair white linen we enfold
    The dear dead limbs, and richest store
    Of Eastern unguents duly pour
  Upon the body still and cold.

  Why hew the rocky tomb so deep,
    Why raise the monument so fair,
    Save that the form we cherish there
  Is no dead thing, but laid to sleep?

  This is the faithful ministry
    Of Christian men, who hold it true
    That all shall one day live anew
  Who now in icy slumber lie.

  And he whose pitying hand shall lay
    Some friendless outcast 'neath the sod,
    E'en to the almighty Son of God
  Doth that benignant service pay.

  For this same law doth bid us mourn
    Man's common fate, when strangers die,
    And pay the tribute of a sigh,
  As when our kin to rest are borne.

  Of holy Tobit ye have read,
    (Grave father of a pious son),
    Who, though the feast was set, would run
  To do his duty by the dead.

  Though waiting servants stood around,
    From meat and drink he turned away
    And girt himself in haste to lay
  The bones with weeping in the ground.

  Soon Heaven his righteous zeal repays
    With rich reward; the eyes long blind
    In bitter gall strange virtue find
  And open to the sun's clear rays.

  Thus hath our Heavenly Father shown
    How sharp and bitter is the smart
    When sudden on the purblind heart
  The Daystar's healing light is thrown.

  He taught us, too, that none may gaze
    Upon the heavenly demesne
    Ere that in darkness and in pain
  His feet have trod the world's rough ways.

  So unto death itself is given
    Strange bliss, when mortal agony
    Opens the way that leads on high
  And pain is but the path to Heaven.

  Thus to a far serener day
    Our body from the grave returns;
    Eternal life within it burns
  That knows nor languor nor decay.

  These faces now so pinched and pale,
    That marks of lingering sickness show,
    Then fairer than the rose shall glow
  And bloom with youth that ne'er shall fail.

  Ne'er shall crabbed age their beauty dim
    With wrinkled brow and tresses grey,
    Nor arid leanness eat away
  The vigour of the rounded limb.

  Racked with his own destroying pains
    Shall fell Disease, who now attacks
    Our aching frames, his force relax
  Fast fettered in a thousand chains:

  While from its far celestial throne
    The immortal body, victor now,
    Shall watch its old tormentor bow
  And in eternal tortures groan.

  Why do the clamorous mourners wail
    In bootless sorrow murmuring?
    And why doth grief unreasoning
  God's righteous ordinance assail?

  Hushed be your voices, ye that mourn;
    Ye weeping mothers, dry the tear;
    Let none lament for children dear,
  For man through Death to Life is born.

  So do dry seeds grow green again,
    Now dead and buried in the earth,
    And rising to a second birth
  Clothe as of old the verdant plain.

  Take now, O earth, the load we bear,
    And cherish in thy gentle breast
    This mortal frame we lay to rest,
  The poor remains that were so fair.

  For they were once the soul's abode,
    That by God's breath created came;
    And in them, like a living flame,
  Christ's precious gift of wisdom glowed.
