NOTE.


I here take the opportunity of removing a wrong idea of the alleged
injunction of the Prophet against our countrymen the Hindus. The Hon'ble
Raja Siva Prasad, in his speech at the Legislative Council, on the 9th
March, 1883, while discussing the Ilbert Bill, quoted from Amir Khusro's
_Tarikh Alai_ that, "Ala-ud-din Khiliji once sent for a Kazi, and asked
him what was written in the Code of Mehammadan law regarding the Hindus.
The Kazi answered that, the Hindus were _Zimmis_ (condemned to pay the
Jizya tax); if asked silver, they ought to pay gold with deep respect
and humility; and if the collector of taxes were to fling dirt in their
faces, they should gladly open their mouths wide. God's order is to keep
them in subjection, and the Prophet enjoins on the faithful to kill,
plunder and imprison them, to make Mussulmans, or to put them to the
sword, to enslave them, and confiscate their property....'" [_Vide_
Supplement to the _Gazette of India_, April 21, 1883, page 807.]

These alleged injunctions, I need not say here, after what I have stated
in various places of this book regarding intolerance, and compulsory
conversion, are merely false imputations. There are no such injunctions
of the Prophet against either _Zimmis_, (_i.e._, protected or
guaranteed) or the Hindus.

TABLE OF CONTENTS


Introduction--

Paras.                                                          Page.
1.  Object of the book                                              i

2.  Early wrongs of the Moslem; justification in taking up
    arms, if taken                                                 ii

3.  Commencement of the war; the Koreish being public
    enemy were liable to be treated as such                     _ib._

4.  But the Moslems could not take up arms to redress their
    wrongs under certain circumstances                            iii

5.  Moslems otherwise engaged at Medina had no intention
    of suffering the horrors of war by taking the initiative,
    but were in imminent danger from the enemy                     iv

6.  The Koreish first attacked the Moslems at Medina. They
    could not forbear the escape of the Moslems                     v

7.  Three battles waged by the Koreish against Mohammad--Badr,
    Ohad, and Ahzab: these wars on the Moslem side
    were purely in defence, not waged even to redress their
    wrongs or re-establish their rights                           vii

8.  The battle of Badr was defensive on the part of Mohammad.
    Reasons for the same                                         viii

9.  Mohammad at Medina, owing to the attacks, inroads, and
    threatening gatherings of the Koreish and other tribes,
    had hardly time to think of offensive measures                 xi

10. Armed opposition of the Koreish to the Moslem pilgrims
    from Medina in the vicinity of Mecca. The truce of
    Hodeibia                                                       xv

11. The Koreish again commit hostilities and violate their
    pledge. War declared against those who had violated
    the truce. War not carried out                                xvi

12. War with foes other than Koreish                            xviii

13. Expedition to Tabuk to check the advancing enemy. No
    war took place                                                xix

14. Number of the wars of Mohammad much exaggerated:
    _Ghazava_ defined; number of actual wars                       xx

15. The Revd. Mr. Green's remarks on the wars of Mohammad
    criticised                                                  xxiii

16. Another view of the wars of Mohammad                       xxviii

17. Caravans if waylaid were waylaid by way of reprisal           xxx

18. Intolerance; no compulsory conversion enjoined or took
    place during Mohammad's lifetime:
      Sir W. Muir quoted and refuted                             xxxi

19. A brief sketch of the propagation of Islam at Mecca:
      Islam at Mecca;
      Islam at Abyssinia;
      Conversions at Nakhla                                     xxxii

20. Rapid stride of Islam at Medina                            xxxvii

21. The increasing number of Moslem converts at Mecca
    after the Hegira                                            xxxix

22. Disturbed state of the public peace among the tribes
    surrounding Medina. Internicine wars, an obstacle to
    the propagation of Islam                                       xl

23. Sketch of the intertribal wars in Arabia during the lifetime
    of Mohammad                                                   xli

24. Spread of Islam in the surrounding tribes at Medina
    after the Hegira I--VI                                      xliii

25. Mecca a barrier against the conversion of the Southern
    tribes                                                       xliv

26. Tribal conversions in the sixth year. Conversion among
    several other tribes of the North and North-east in
    A.H. VIII                                                     xlv

27. Surrender of Mecca, A.H. VIII                               xlvii

28. Mecca not compelled to believe                              _ib._

29. The wholesale conversion of the remaining tribes,
    A.H. IX and X                                              xlviii

30. The various deputations in the 9th and 10th year of the
    Hegira                                                         li

31. A list of the deputations of conversion received by
    Mohammad at Medina during A.H. IX and X                 li--lviii

32. All conversions, individual and tribal, were without any
    compulsion                                                    lix

33. Mohammad was not favoured with circumstances round
    him. The difficulty Mohammad encountered in his
    work. Marcus Dods quoted:
      Dr. Mohseim's causes of the spread of Islam and Hallam
        quoted                                                lx--lxv

34. Mohammad's unwavering belief in his own mission and
    his success show him to be a true prophet. Mohammad's
    efforts established monotheism in Arabia. His
    manly exertions, and his single handed perseverance.
    The business and office of a prophet described. Sir W.
    Muir and Stobart quoted                                 lxv--lxix

    superstition. Muir, Marcus Dods, Stephens
    quoted                                               lxix--lxxvii

36. Indictment against Mohammad. His alleged cruelty and
    sensuality. Muir, Rev. Hughes, Marcus Dods, and
    Stanley Poole refuted                            lxxviii--lxxxvii

37. Objections to the (1) Finality of the social reforms of
    Mohammad, (2) positive precepts, (3) ceremonial law,
    (4) morality, (5) want of adaptability to the varying
    circumstances                                     lxxxvii--lxxxix

38. All these objections apply rather to the teaching of the
    Mohammadan Common Law than to the Koran                        xc

39. (1) Finality of social reforms of Mohammad discussed.
    Intermediary not to be considered final                  xc--xcii

40. (2) Positive precepts and (3) ceremonial law, pilgrimage,
    _Kibla_, amount of alms, fasts, forms and attitude of
    prayer, &c.: pretentious prayers and ostentatious
