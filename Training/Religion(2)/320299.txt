                E laka i ka loaa;
            5   E Laka i ka waiwai;
                E Laka i na mea a pau!

                     [Translation]

                  _Altar-Prayer_

                O goddess Laka!
                O wildwood bouquet, O Laka!
                O Laka, queen of the voice!
                O Laka, giver of gifts!
            5   O Laka, giver of bounty!
                O Laka, giver of all things!

           At the conclusion of this loving service of worship and song
           each member of the troupe removes from his head and neck the
           wreaths that had bedecked him, and with them crowns the
           image of the goddess until her altar is heaped with the
           offerings.

           Now comes the pith of the ceremony: the novitiates sit down
           to the feast of ai-lolo, theirs the place of honor, at the
           head of the table, next the kuahiu. The _ho'o-pa'a_, acting
           as carver, selects the typical parts--snout, ear-tips, tail,
           feet, portions of the vital organs, especially the brain
           (_lolo_). This last it is which gives name to the ceremony.
           He sets an equal portion before each novitiate. Each one must
           eat all that is set before him. It is a mystical rite, a
           sacrament; as he eats he consciously partakes of the virtue
           of the goddess that is transmitted to himself.
[Page 35]
           Meantime the _olohe_ and friends of the novitiates, inspired
           with the proper enthusiasm, of the occasion, lift their
           voices in joyful cantillations in honor of the goddess,
           accompanied with the clapping of hands.

           The ceremony now reaches a new stage. The kumu lifts the tabu
           by uttering a prayer--always a song--and declares the place
           and the feast free, and the whole assembly sit down to enjoy
           the bounty that is spread up and down the halau. On this
           occasion men and women may eat in common. The only articles
           excluded from this feast are _luau_--a food much like
           spinach, made by cooking the young and delicate taro
           leaf---and the drupe of the _hala_, the pandanus (pl. xviii).

           The company sit down to eat and to drink; presently they rise
           to dance and sing. The kumu leads in a tabu-lifting,
           freedom-giving song and the ceremony of ai-lolo is over. The
           pupils have been graduated from the school of the halau; they
           are now members of the great guild of hula dancers. The time
           has come for them to make their bow to the waiting public
           outside, to bid for the favor of the world. This is to be
           their "little go;" they will spread their wings for a
           greater flight on the morrow.

           The kumu with his big drum, and the musicians, the ho'o-pa'a,
           pass through the door and take their places outside in the
           lanai, where sit the waiting multitude. At the tap of the
           drum the group of waiting olapa plume themselves like fine
           birds eager to show their feathers; and, as they pass out the
           halau door and present themselves to the breathless audience,
           into every pose and motion of their gliding, swaying figures
           they pour a full tide of emotion in studied and unstudied
           effort to captivate the public.

                           DEBUT OF A HULA DANCER

           The occasion is that of a lifetime; it is their _uniki_,
           their debut. The song chosen must rise to the dignity of the
           occasion. Let us listen to the song that enthralls the
           audience seated in the rushstrown lanai, that we may judge of
           its worthiness.

           It seems surprising that the accident spoken of in line 19
           should be mentioned; for it is in glaring opposition to the
           canons that were usually observed in the composition of a
           _mele-inoa._ In the construction of a, eulogy the Hawaiians
           were not only punctiliously careful to avoid mention of
           anything susceptible of sinister interpretation, but they
           were superstitiously sensitive to any such unintentional
           happening. As already mentioned (p. 27), they believed that
           the fate compelling power of a word of ill-omen was
           inevitable. If it did not result in the death of the one
           eulogized, retributive justice turned the evil influence back
           on him who uttered it.

                   VI.--THE PASSWORD--THE SONG OF ADMISSION


           There prevailed among the practitioners of the hula from one
           end of the group to the other a mutual understanding,
           amounting almost to a sort of freemasonry, which gave to any
           member of the guild the right of free entrance at all times
           to the hall, or halau, where a performance was under way.
           Admission was conditioned, however, on the utterance of a
           password at the door. A snatch of song, an oli, denominated
           _mele kahea,_ or _mele wehe puka,_ was chanted, which, on
           being recognized by those within, was answered in the same
           language of hyperbole, and the door was opened.

           The verbal accuracy of any mele kahea that may be adduced is
           at the present day one of the vexed questions among hula
           authorities, each hula-master being inclined to maintain that
           the version given by another is incorrect. This remark
           applies, though in smaller measure, to the whole body of
           mele, pule, and oli that makes up the songs and liturgy of
           the hula as well as to the traditions that guided the
           maestro, or kumu-hula, in the training of his company. The
           reasons for these differences of opinion and of test, now
           that there is to be a written text, are explained by the
           following facts: The devotees and practitioners of the hula
           were divided into groups that were separated from one another
           by wide intervals of sea and land. They belonged quite likely
           to more than one cult, for indeed there were many gods and
           _au-makua_ to whom they sacrificed and offered prayers. The
           passwords adopted by one generation or by the group of
           practitioners on one island might suffer verbal changes in
           transmission to a later generation or to a remote island.

           Again, it should be remembered that the entire body of
           material forming the repertory of the hula--pule, mele, and
           oli--was intrusted to the keeping of the memory, without the
           aid of letters or, so far as known, of any mnemonic device;
           and the human mind, even under the most athletic discipline,
           is at best an imperfect conservator of literary form. The
           result was what might be expected: as the imagination and
           emotions of the minstrel warmed under the inspiration of his
           trust, glosses and amendments crept in. These, however,
           caused but slight variations in the text. The substance
           remains substantially the same.

           After carefully weighing the matter, the author can not avoid
           the conclusion that jealousy had much to do with the slight
           differences now manifest, that one version is as
[Page 39]  authoritative as another, and that it would be well for each
           kumu-hula to have kept in mind the wise adage that shines
           among the sayings of his nation: _Aohe pau ka ike i kau halau
           _[56]--" Think not that all of wisdom resides in your
           halau."[57]

           [Footnote 56: Sophocles (Antigone, 705) had said the same
           thing:[Greek: me nun en ethos pounon en sauto phorei os
           phes su, kouden allo, tout' orphos echein]--"Don't get this
           idea fixed in your head, that what you say, and nothing else,
           is right."]

           [Footnote 57: _Hatoa._ As previously explained, in this
           connection _halau_ has a meaning similar to our word
           "school," or "academy," a place where some art was taught, as
           wrestling, boxing, or the hula.]

                            _Song of Welcome_

                What love to our cottage-homes, now vacant,
                As one climbs the mount of Entreaty!
                    We call,

           Another fragment that was sometimes used as a password is the
           following bit of song taken from the story of Hiiaka, sister
           of Pele. She is journeying with the beautiful Hopoe to feteh
           prince Lohiau to the court of Pele. They have come by a steep
           and narrow path to the brink of the Wai-lua river, Kauai, at
           this point spanned by a single plank. But the bridge is gone,
           removed by an ill-tempered naiad (witch) said to have come
           from Kahiki, whose name, Wai-lua, is the same as that of the
           stream. Hiiaka calls out, demanding that the plank be
           restored to its place. Wai-lua does not recognize the deity
           in Hiiaka and, sullen, makes no response. At this the goddess
           puts forth her strength, and Wai-lua, stripped of her power
           and reduced to her true station, that of a _mo'o,_ a reptile,
           seeks refuge in the caverns beneath the river. Hiiaka betters
           the condition of the crossing by sowing it with stepping
           stones. The stones remain in evidence to this day.

                He ole ka hea mai, e!

                           Password--Song

                Steep stands the mountain in calm,
                Profile of Wai-ale-ale at Wai-lua.
                Gone the stream-spanning plank of Wai-kini,
                Filched away by Nou-nou;
            5   Shut off the view of the hill Ipu-ha'a,
                And the upland expanse of Ka-pa'a.
                Give voice and make answer.
                Dead silence--no voice in reply.

           In later, in historic times, this visitor, whom we have kept
           long waiting at the door, might have voiced his appeal in the
           passionate words of this comparatively modern song:

           mountain-mass of Kauai.]

                Ka uka holo-kia ahi-manu o La'a,[61]
                I po-ele i ka uahi, noe ka nahele,
                Nohe-nohea i ka makani luhau-pua.
                He pua oni ke kanaka--
            5   He mea laha ole la oe.
                Mai kaua e hea nei;
                E hea i ke kanaka e komo maloko,
                B hanai ai a hewa[62] ka wa'ha.
                Eia no ka uku la, o ka wa'a.[63]

                                 _Password--Song_

                In the uplands, the darting flame-bird of La'a,
                While smoke and mist blur the woodland,
                Is keen for the breath of frost-bitten flowers.
                    A fickle flower is man--
            5   A trick this not native to you.
                Come thou with her who is calling to thee;
                A call to the man to come in
                And eat till the mouth is awry.
                    Lo, this the reward--the canoe.

           [Footnote 60: This utterance of passion is said to have been,
           the composition of the Princess-Kamamalu, as an address to
           Prince William Lunalilo, to whom she was at one time
           affianced and would have married, but that King Lihohho
           (Kamehameha IV) would not allow the marriage. Thereby hangs a
           tragedy.]

           [Footnote 61: _La'a_. The region in Hawaii now known as Ola'a
           was originally called La'a. The particle _o_ has become fused
           with the word.]

           [Footnote 62: _Hewa ka waha_. This expression, here tortured,
           into "(till) the mouth awry," is difficult of translation. A
           skilled Hawaiian scholar suggests, it may mean to change one
           from, an enemy to a friend by stopping his mouth with food.]

           [Footnote 63: _Wa'a_. Literally a canoe. This is a euphemism
           for the human body, a gift often too freely granted. It will
           be noted that in the answering mele komo, the song of
           admission, the reward promised is more modestly
           measured--"Simply the voice."]

            The answer to this appeal for admission was in these words:

                           _Mele Komo_

                E hea i ke kanaka e komo maloko,
                E hanai ai a hewa waha;
                Eia no ka uku la, o ka leo,
                A he leo wale no, e!

                            [Translation]

                            Welcoming-Song

                Call to the man to come in,
                And eat till the mouth is estopt;
                And this the reward, the voice,
                Simply the voice.

           The cantillation of the _mele komo_: in answer to the
           visitor's petition, meant not only the opening to him of the
           halau door, but also his welcome to the life of the halau as
           a heart-guest of honor, trebly welcome as the bringer of
           fresh tidings from the outside world.

                   VII.--WORSHIP AT THE ALTAR OF THE HALAU


           The first duty of a visitor on being admitted to the halau
           while the tabu was on--that is, during the conduct of a
           regular hula--was to do reverence at the kuahu. The
           obligations of religion took precedence of all social
           etiquette. He reverently approaches the altar, to which all
           eyes are turned, and with outstretched hands pours out a
           supplication that breathes the aroma of ancient prayer:

                  _Pule Kuahu_ (no Laka)

                O Laka oe,
                O ke akua i ke a'a-lii[64] nui.
                E Laka mai uka!
                E Laka mai kai!
            5   O hoo-ulu[65] o Lono,
                O ka ilio nana e haehae ke aha,
                O ka ie-le ku i ka wao,
                O ka maile hihi i ka nahele,
                O ka lau ki-ele[66] ula o ke akua,
            10  O na ku'i[67] o Hauoli,
                O Ha'i-ka-malama,[68]
                Wahine o Kina'u.[69]
                Kapo ula[70] o Kina'u.
                O Laka oe,
            15  O ke akua i ke kuahu nei la, e!
                E ho'i, e ho'i a nolao i kou kuahu.
                Hoo-ulu ia!

           [Footnote 64: _A'a-lii_. A deep-rooted tree, sacred to Laka
           or to Kapo.]

           [Footnote 65: Hoo-ulu. Literally to make grow; secondarily,
           to inspire, to prosper, to bring good luck. This is the
           meaning most in mind in modern times, since the hula has
           become a commercial venture.]

           [Footnote 66: _Ki-ele_. A flowering plant native to the
           Hawaiian woods, also cultivated, sacred to Laka, and perhaps
           to Kapo. The leaves are said to be pointed and curved like
           the beak of the bird _i-iwi_, and the flower has the gorgeous
           yellow-red color of that bird.]

           [Footnote 67: It has been proposed to amend this verse by
           substituting _akua_, for _ku'i_, thus making the idea the
           gods of the hula.]

           [Footnote 68: _Hai-ka-malama_. An epithet applied to Laka.]

           [Footnote 69: _Kina'u_. Said to mean Hiiaka, the sister of
           Pele.]

           [Footnote 70: _Kapo ula_. Red, _ula_, was the favorite color
           of Kapo. The _kahuna anaana_, high priests of sorcery, of the
           black art, and of murder, to whom Kapo was at times
           procuress, made themselves known as such by the display of a
           red flag and the wearing of a red malo.]

                           [Translation]

                      _Altar-Prayer_ (to Laka)

                Thou art Laka,
                God of the deep-rooted a'a-lii.
                O Laka from the mountains,
                O Laka from the ocean!
[Page 43]   5   Let Lono bless the service,
                Shutting the mouth of the dog,
                That breaks the charm with his barking.
                Bring the i-e that grows in the wilds,
                The maile that twines in the thicket,
           10   Red-beaked kiele, leaf of the goddess,
                The joyous pulse of the dance
                In honor of Ha'i-ka-malama,
                Friend of Kina'u,
                Red-robed friend of Kina'u.
           15   Thou art Laka,
                God of this altar here.
                Return, return and reside at your altar!
                Bring it good luck!

           A single prayer may not suffice as the offering at Laka's
           altar. His repertory is full; the visitor begins anew, this
           time on a different tack:

                   _Pule Kuahu_ (no Laka)

                Eia ke kuko, ka li'a;
                I ka manawa he hiamoe ko'u,
                Hoala ana oe,
                  O oe o Halau-lani,
            5     O Hoa-lani,
                  O Puoho-lani,
                Me he manu e hea ana i ka maha lehua
                Ku moho kiekie la i-uka.
                I-uka ho'i au me Laka
           10   A Lea,[71] a Wahie-loa,[72], i ka nahelehele;
                He hoa kaana ia no'u,
                No kela kuahiwi, kualono hoi.
                  E Laka, e Laka, e!
                B maliu mai!
           15   A maliu mai oe pono au,
