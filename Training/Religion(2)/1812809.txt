church displacing kingdom--two-fold division of men formerly--now
three-fold--church different in organization from kingdom--the Baptist
puzzled--Jesus did not fill out Hebrew prophecy--two characteristics,

gospel--Paul's audiences--Luke's gospel--these three tell of rejection
mainly--John's gospel--the order of the gospels in canon.

_The Surprised Church_: God holds to His plan--mixed ideas of kingdom and
church--a handy principle of interpretation--one law consistently
applied--the church to fulfil its mission and go--the kingdom simply
retarded, yet to come--the plan enriched--sliding scale of fulfilment--the
King must come--- even this in Hebrew picture, Zechariah 12:10. New
