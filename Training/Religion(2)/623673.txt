To the Everlasting Father,
And the Son Who reigns on high,
With the Holy Ghost proceeding
Forth from Each eternally,
Be salvation, honor, blessing,
Might, and endless majesty. Amen.

Jesus, my Lord, my God, my All

Father Faber
Nicola A. Montani


Slowly

1.
Jesus, my Lord, my God, my All!
How can I love Thee as I ought?
And how revere this wondrous gift,
So far surpassing hope or thought?

Refrain
Sweet Sacrament! We Thee adore!
Oh, make us love Thee more and more.   (Repeat refrain ad lib)

2.
Had I but Mary's sinless heart
To love Thee with my dearest King!
Oh, with what bursts of fervent praise
Thy goodness, Jesus! Would I sing!

3.
Thy Body, Soul, and Godhead all!
O mystery of love divine!
I cannot compass all I have,
For all Thou hast and art are mine.

4.
Sound, sound His praises higher still,
And come, ye angels, to our aid;
'Tis God! 'tis God! The very God,
Whose pow'r both man and angels made!

Jesus, Food of Angels

Communion Hymn
Partendo dal Mondo
Translated by Father E. Vaughan, C. S. S. R.
Ch. Gounod
Arr. by N. A. M.


Andante Religioso

1.
Jesus, food of angels,
Monarch of the heart;
Oh, that I could never
From Thy Face depart!
Yes, Thou ever dwellest
Here for love of me,
Hidden Thou remainest,
God of Majesty.

2.
Soon I hope to see Thee,
And enjoy Thy love,
Face to face, sweet Jesus,
In Thy heav'n above.
But on earth an exile
My delight shall be
Ever to be near Thee
Veiled for love of me.

O Jesus Christ, remember
Gesu Sacramentato

Father Caswall
Nicola A. Montani


With devotion

1.
O Jesus Christ, remember,
When Thou shalt come again,
Upon the clouds of Heaven,
With all Thy shining train;
When ev'ry eye shall see Thee
In Deity revealed,
Who now upon this altar
In silence art concealed;

2.
Remember then, O Saviour,
I supplicate of Thee,
That here I bowed before Thee
Upon my bended knee;
That here I owned Thy Presence,
And did not Thee deny;
And glorified Thy greatness,
Though hid from human eye.

3.
Accept Divine Redeemer,
The homage of my praise;
Be Thou the light and honor
And glory of my days;
Be Thou my consolation
When death is drawing nigh;
Be Thou my only treasure
Through all eternity.

Wondrous love that cannot falter

(Hymn of the Association of Perpetual Adoration)
Tr. Rt. Rev. Msgr. H. T. Henry
Ch. Gounod
Arr. by N. A. M.


Andante con espressione

1.
Wondrous love that cannot falter!
Jesus in the Host doth dwell
Day and night upon the Alter
Near to those He loves so well.

Refrain
Low in endless worship bent,
Praise the Blessed Sacrament.

2.
Angel hosts are hushed in wonder
And adore with folded wings:
For the lowly Species under,
Hidden lies the King of Kings.

3.
Tho' the Heav'nly choir rejoices
Praise and sing His loving ear
Seeks the tribute of our voices:
'Tis for us He waiteth here!

4.
All He hath in highest Heaven
Veiled in the Host we see:
And to us the care is given
Of His wondrous poverty.

5.
Bread of Angels! Who can measure
All it means? this daily food
And the daily granted treasure
Of His sacrificial Blood?

6.
Bending low in adoration
Ever constant let us be,
Making Jesus Reparation
For the worlds in constancy.

O Food of pilgrims given,
Bread of the hosts of Heaven
Thou Manna of the sky!
Feed with the blessed sweetness,
Of Thy divine completeness
The hearts that for Thee sigh.

2.
O Fountain ruby glowing,
O stream of love outflowing
From Jesus' pierc-ed Side!
This thought alone shall bless us
This one desire possess us,
To drink of Thy sweet tide.

3.
We love Thee, Jesu tender
Who hid'st Thine awful splendor
Beneath these veils of grace:
O let the veils be riven,
And our clear eye in heaven
Behold Thee face to face!

THE SACRED HEART

O Heart of Jesus, Heart of God

Lady G. Fullerton
Nicola. A. Montani


Moderato

1.
O Heart of Jesus, Heart of God,
O source of boundless love;
By angels praised, by saints adored
From their bright throne above.
The poorest, saddest heart on earth,
May claim Thee for its own;
O burning, throbbing Heart of Christ,
Too late, too little known.

2.
The hearts of men are often hard
And full of selfish care;
But in the Sacred Heart we find
A refuge from despair.
To Thee, my Jesus, then I come,
A poor and helpless child;
And on Thine own words "Come to Me,"
My only hope I build.

3.
The world is cold, and life is sad,
I crave this blessed rest
Of those who lay their weary heads
Upon Thy sacred Breast.
For love is stronger far than death,
And who can love like Thee,
My Saviour, Whose appealing Heart
Broke on the Cross for me?

Sacred Heart of Jesus, fount of love and mercy,
Today we come Thy blessing to implore;
Oh, touch our hearts, so cold and so ungrateful,
And make them, Lord, Thine own forever more.

Sacred Heart of Jesus! We implore,
Oh, makes us love Thee more and more.

Unfold to us the treasures of Thy grace,
That so our hearts, from things of earth up lifted,
May long alone to gaze upon Thy Face.

Sacred Heart of Jesus! Make us pure and gentle,
And teach us how to do Thy blessed will;
To follow close the print of Thy dear footsteps,
And when we fall Sacred Heart, oh, love us still.

4.
Sacred Heart of Jesus! Bless all hearts that love Thee,
And Thine own Heart ever blessed be;
Bless us, dear Lord, and bless the friends we cherish,
And keep us true to Mary and to Thee.

Jesus, Creator of the world
(Auctor beate saeculi)

Unison or two-part chorus
Translated by Father Caswall
J. d' Hooghe


Andantino

1.
Jesus, Creator of the world!
Of all mankind Redeemed blest!
True God of God! In Whom we see
The Father's Image clear expressed.

2.
Thee, Saviour, love alone constrain'd
To make our mortal flesh Thine own;
And as a second Adam come,
For the first Adam to atone.

3.
That self same love that made the sky,
Which made the sea, and stars, and earth,
Took pity on our misery,
And broke the bondage of our birth.

4.
O Jesu! In Thy Heart divine
May that same love forever glow,
Forever mercy to mankind,
From that exhaustless fountain flow.

5.
For this Thy Sacred Heart was pierced,
And both with Blood and Water ran;
To cleanse us from the stains of guilt,
And be the hope of strength of man.

6.
To God the Father, and the Son,
All praise, and pow'r, and glory be;
With Thee, O holy Paraclete,
Henceforth through a eternity.

Slowly

1.
To Jesus' Heart, all burning
With fervent love for men,
My heart with fondest yearning
Shall raise its joyful strain.

Refrain
While ages course along,
Blest be with the loudest song
The Sacred Heart of Jesus
By ev'ry heart and tongue!

2.
Too true I have forsaken
Thy love by wilful sin;
Yet now let me be taken
Back by Thy grace again.

3.
As Thou art meek and lowly,
And ever pure of heart,
So may my heart be wholly
Of Thine the counterpart,

4.
O that to me were given
The pinions of a dove,
I'd speed aloft to heaven,
My Jesus' love to prove.

5.
When life away is flying,
And earth's false glare is done;
Still, Sacred heart, in dying
I'll say I'm all Thine own.

Heart of Jesus! golden chalice

Processional
Bishop Casartelli
Ch. Gounod
Arr. by N. A. M.


Slowly with devotion

1.
Heart of Jesus! golden chalice
Brimming with the ruddy Wine,
Trodden in the press of fury,
Purest juice of truest vine,
From the Vineyards of Engeddi,
Quench this thirsty heart of mine.

2.
Heart of Jesus! Comb of honey
From the cleft of Calvary's rock,
Sweetness coming from the Strong One,
Dripping from the green-wood stock;
Famishing of death is on us:
Feed, oh, feed Thy hungry flock!

3.
Heart of Jesus! Rose of Sharon
Glist'ning with the dew of tears,
All among the thorny prickles
Lo! Thy blood-stained Head appears!
Spread Thy fragrance all around us,
Sweetly lulling all our fears!

4.
Heart of Jesus! broken Vial
Full of precious spikenard!
Alabaster vase of ointment!
See, our souls are sore and hard:
Let Thy healing virtue touch them,
And from sin's corruption guards!

1.
To Christ, the Prince of Peace,
And Son of God most high,
The Father of the world to come,
Sing we with holy joy.
Deep in His heart for us
The wound of love He bore;
That love, wherewith He still inflames
The hearts that Him adore.

2.
O Jesus! Victim blest!
What else but love divine,
Could Thee constrain to open thus
That Sacred Heat of Thine?
O Fount of endless life!
O Spring of water clear!
O Flame celestial cleansing all
Who unto Thee draws near.
