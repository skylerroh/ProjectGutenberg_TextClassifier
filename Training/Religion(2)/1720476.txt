      Appears the dawn of heaven.

1   Jerusalem! my glorious home!
      Name ever dear to me!
    When shall my labors have an end
      In joy, and peace and thee?
    When shall these eyes thy heaven-built walls
      And pearly gates behold?
    Thy bulwarks with salvation strong,
      And streets of shining gold.

2   There happier bowers than Eden's bloom,
      Nor sin nor sorrow know:
    Blest seats! through rude and stormy scenes
      I onward press to you.
    Why should I shrink at pain and woe?
      Or feel at death dismay?
    I've Canaan's goodly land in view,
      And realms of endless day.

3   Apostles, martyrs, prophets, there,
      Around my Saviour stand;
    And soon my friends in Christ below
      Will join the glorious band.
    Jerusalem! my glorious home!
      My soul still pants for thee;
    Then shall my labors have an end,
      When I thy joys shall see.

1     Far from these scenes of night
      Unbounded glories rise,

      Forever bright and fair;
    For sin, the source of mortal woe,
      Can never enter there.

    Where mortal footstep hath not been,
      Nor ear hath caught its sounds of joy.

2   That world to come! and O how blest!--
      Fairer than prophets ever told;
    And never did an angel-guest
      One half its blessedness unfold.

3   It is all holy and serene,--
      The land of glory and repose;
    And there, to dim the radiant scene,
      No tear of sorrow ever flows.

4   It is not fanned by summer gale;
      'Tis not refreshed by vernal showers;
    It never needs the moon-beam pale,
      For there are known no evening hours.

5   There forms unseen by mortal eye,
      Too glorious for our sight to bear,
    Are walking with their God on high,
      And waiting our arrival there.

      Have reached the heavenly state.

3   Hunger and thirst they know no more,
      From burning heats refreshed;
    The Lamb shall feed them from his store,
      And give them endless rest.

      And they his wonders tell,
    While in his temple they shall stay,
      And God with them shall dwell.

      There rests no shadow, falls no stain;
    There those who meet shall part no more,
      And those long parted meet again.

3   Its skies are not like earthly skies,
      With varying hues of shade and light;
    It hath no need of suns to rise,
      To dissipate the gloom of night.

      Across that calm, serene abode;
    The wanderer there a home may find,

      Are earnests of serener years.

    Grief may abide, an evening guest,

4   And thou, who o'er thy friend's low bier
      Sheddest the bitter drops like rain,
    Hope that a brighter, happier sphere
      Will give him to thy arms again.

    And heaven's long age of bliss shall pay
      For all his children suffer here.

Farewell to a Friend Departed.


1   Thou art gone to the grave; but we will not deplore thee;
      Though sorrows and darkness encompass the tomb;
    The Saviour has passed through its portals before thee;
      And the lamp of his love is thy guide through the gloom.

2   Thou art gone to the grave; we no longer behold thee,
      Nor tread the rough paths of the world by thy side:
    But the wide arms of mercy are spread to enfold thee,
      And sinners may hope, since the Saviour hath died.

3   Thou art gone to the grave; and, its mansion forsaking,
      Perchance thy weak spirit in doubt lingered long;
    But the sunshine of heaven beamed bright on thy waking,
      And the sound thou didst hear was the seraphim's song.

4   Thou art gone to the grave; but we will not deplore thee;
      Since God was thy Refuge, thy Guardian, thy Guide;
    He gave thee, he took thee, and he will restore thee;
      And death has no sting, since the Saviour hath died.

    Where, on the bosom of their God,
      They rest from human woe!

      On us, on us descend;
    To us their strong aspiring hopes,

      Pass like an evening meteor's flight!
    Not dark with guilt, nor dim with tears;
      Whose course is short, unclouded, bright.

3   O, cheerless were our lengthened way;
      But Heaven's own light dispels the gloom,
    Streams downward from eternal day,
      And casts a glory round the tomb.

4   O, stay thy tears: the blest above
      Have hailed a spirit's heavenly birth,
    And sung a song of joy and love;
      Then why should anguish reign on earth?

      O'erwearied and unblest,
    A host of restless phantoms chase;--
      Why mourn for those who rest?

2     We mourn for those who sin?
      Bound in the tempter's snare,
    Whom syren pleasure beckons in
      To prisons of despair;
      Whose hearts, by passions torn,
      Are wrecked on folly's shore;--

      For those who sin no more?

      Whom stern afflictions bend
    With anguish o'er the lowly sleep

      Of pain and grief is o'er,
    Whose tears our God hath wiped away,
      O mourn for them no more!

      Who've fled and left thee mourning here?
    Triumphant o'er their latest foe,
      They glory in a brighter sphere.

2   Weep not for them;--beside thee now
      Perhaps they watch with guardian care,
    And witness tears that idly flow
      O'er those who bliss of angels share.

3   Or round their Father's throne, above,
      With raptured voice his praise they sing;
    Or on his messages of love,
      They journey with unwearied wing.

4   Weep, weep no more; their voices raise
      The song of triumph high to God;
    And wouldst thou join their song of praise,
      Walk humbly in the path they trod.

1     Friend after friend departs;
      Who hath not lost a friend?

    Living or dying, none were blest.

      Where parting is unknown,--
    A whole eternity of love
      And blessedness alone;
    And faith beholds the dying here,
    Translated to that happier sphere.

3     Thus, star by star declines
      Till all are passed away,

      To pure and perfect day.
    Nor sink those stars in empty night--
    They hide themselves in heaven's own light.

      And softened every bed:
    Where should the dying members rest,

Peaceful Death of the Righteous.


1   I looked upon the righteous man,
      And saw his parting breath,
    Without a struggle or a sigh,
      Serenely yield to death:
    There was no anguish on his brow,
      Nor terror in his eye;
    The spoiler aimed a fatal dart,
      But lost the victory.

2   I looked upon the righteous man,
      And heard the holy prayer
    Which rose above that breathless form,
      To soothe the mourners' care,
    And felt how precious was the gift
      He to his loved ones gave,--
    The stainless memory of the just,
      The wealth beyond the grave.

3   I looked upon the righteous man;
      And all our earthly trust
    Of pleasure, vanity, or pride,
      Seemed lighter than the dust,
    Compared with his celestial gain,--
      A home above the sky:
    O, grant us, Lord, his life to live,
      That we like him may die.

      Amid a sinless throng,
    He utters in his Saviour's ear

      But lift our earnest prayer,
    And daily every effort bend
      To rise and join him there.

Death of an Infant.


1   As the sweet flower that scents the morn,
      But withers in the rising day,
    Thus lovely was this infant's dawn,
      Thus swiftly fled its life away.

2   It died ere its expanding soul
      Had ever burnt with wrong desires,
    Had ever spurned at Heaven's control,
      Or ever quenched its sacred fires.

3   Yet the sad hour that took the boy
      Perhaps has spared a heavier doom,--
    Snatched him from scenes of guilty joy,
      Or from the pangs of ills to come.

4   He died to sin; he died to care;
      But for a moment felt the rod;
    Then, rising on the viewless air,
      Spread his light wings, and soared to God.

      Thy Saviour dwells on high;
    There everlasting spring appears;
      There joy shall never die.

Children in Heaven.


1   In the broad fields of heaven,--
      In the immortal bowers,
    By life's clear river dwelling,
      Amid undying flowers,--
    There hosts of beauteous spirits,
      Fair children of the earth,
    Linked in bright bands celestial,
      Sing of their human birth.

2   They sing of earth and heaven,--
      Divinest voices rise
    To God, their gracious Father,
      Who called them to the skies:
    They all are there,--in heaven,--
      Safe, safe, and sweetly blest;
    No cloud of sin can shadow
      Their bright and holy rest.

Death of a Young Girl.


1     What though the stream be dead,
      Its banks all still and dry!
    It murmurs o'er a lovelier bed,
      In air-groves of the sky.

2     What though our bird of light
      Lie mute with plumage dim;
    In heaven I see her glancing bright,
      I hear her angel hymn.

3     True that our beauteous doe
      Hath left her still retreat,
    But purer now in heavenly snow,
      She lies at Jesus' feet.

4     O star! untimely set!
      Why should we weep for thee!
    Thy bright and dewy coronet
      Is rising o'er the sea.

Dirge for an Infant.


1   Lay her gently in the dust;
    Grievous task, but oh! ye must!
    Hear the sentence, "earth to earth,
    Spirit to immortal birth;"
    Youthful, gentle, undefiled,
    Angels nurture now the child!

2   Upward soaring, like the dove,
    Bearing with her chains of love;
    Not to draw her spirit back,
    But to smooth her upward track:
    Her, the youngest of thy fold,
    Angels watch with love untold!

3   With the Rock of Ages trust,
    That which was enshrined in dust;
    Robed in ever-spotless white,
    In an atmosphere of light,
    By the never-failing springs
    Rests she now her weary wings.

Death of a Child.


1   Thou gavest, and we yield to thee,
      God of the human heart!
    For bitter though grief's cup may be,
      Thou givest but our part.

2   O, thou canst bid our grief be stilled,
      Yet not rebuke our tears;
    How large a place his presence filled!
      How vacant it appears!

3   We mourn the sunshine of his smile,
      The tendrils of his love;
    Oh, was he loved too well the while
      Ere he was called above?

4   Our chastened spirits bow in prayer,
      And blend all prayers in one,--
    Give us the hope to meet him there,
      When life's full task is done.

Death of the Young.


1   Calm on the bosom of thy God,
      Young spirit, rest thee now!
    E'en while with us thy footsteps trod
      His seal was on thy brow.

2   Dust, to its narrow house beneath!
      Soul, to its place on high!
    They that have seen thy look in death,
      No more may fear to die.

3   Lone are the paths, and sad the bowers,
      Whence thy meek smile is gone;
    But O, a brighter home than ours,
      In heaven is now thine own.

1   Sister, thou wast mild and lovely,
      Gentle as the summer breeze,
    Pleasant as the air of evening,
      When it floats among the trees.

2   Peaceful be thy silent slumber--
      Peaceful in the grave so low:
    Thou no more wilt join our number;
      Thou no more our songs shalt know.

3   Dearest sister, thou hast left us;
      Here thy loss we deeply feel;
    But 'tis God that hath bereft us:
      He can all our sorrows heal.

4   Yet again we hope to meet thee,
      When the day of life is fled,
    Then in heaven with joy to greet thee,
      Where no farewell tear is shed.

Burial of a Christian Brother.


1   Brother, rest from sin and sorrow;
      Death is o'er and life is won;
    On thy slumber dawns no morrow:
      Rest; thine earthly race is run.

2   Brother, wake; the night is waning;
      Endless day is round thee poured;
    Enter thou the rest remaining
      For the people of the Lord.

3   Brother, wake; for he who loved thee,--
      He who died that thou mightst live,--
    He who graciously approved thee,--
      Waits thy crown of joy to give.

4   Fare thee well; though woe is blending
      With the tones of earthly love,
    Triumph high and joy unending
      Wait thee in the realms above.

Death of a Christian in his prime.


1   Go to the grave in all thy glorious prime,
      In full activity of zeal and power;
    A Christian cannot die before his time,
      The Lord's appointment is the servant's hour.

2   Go to the grave; at noon from labor cease;
      Rest on thy sheaves, thy harvest task is done;
    Come from the heat of battle and in peace,
      Soldier, go home; with thee the fight is won.

3   Go to the grave, for there thy Saviour lay
      In death's embraces, ere he rose on high;
    And all the ransomed, by that narrow way,
      Pass to eternal life beyond the sky.

4   Go to the grave:--no, take thy seat above;
      Be thy pure spirit present with the Lord,
    Where thou for faith and hope hast perfect love,
      And open vision for the written word.

On the Death of an aged Christian.

"I have fought a good fight; I have finished my course."


1     Servant of God, well done!
      Rest from thy loved employ:
    The battle fought, the victory won,
      Enter thy Master's joy.
      The voice at midnight came,
      He started up to hear;
    A mortal arrow pierced his frame--
      He fell, but felt no fear.

2     Tranquil amidst alarms,
      It found him on the field,
    A veteran slumbering on his arms,
      Beneath his red-cross shield
      His spirit, with a bound,
      Burst its encumbering clay;
    His tent, at sunrise, on the ground,
      A darkened ruin lay.

3     The pains of death are past,
      Labor and sorrow cease,
    And, life's long warfare closed at last,
      His soul is found in peace.
      Soldier of Christ! well done!
      Praise be thy new employ;
    And while eternal ages run,
      Rest in thy Saviour's joy.

1   Dear as thou wert, and justly dear,
      We will not weep for thee:
    One thought shall check the starting tear
      It is, that thou art free.

2   And thus shall faith's consoling power
