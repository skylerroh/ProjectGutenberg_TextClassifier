when they threatened to let loose the wild beasts upon him, and he
replied: "Let them come; I cannot change at once from good to bad."
Then they bound him to the stake, set fire to the fagots, and his pure
faith went up through the baptism of fire to a higher sense of Life.
The infidel was blind who said, "Christianity is fit only for women
and weak-minded men." But infidels disagree; for Bonaparte said:
"Since ever the history of Christianity was written, the loftiest
intellects have had a practical faith in God;" and Daniel Webster
said: "My heart has assured and reassured me that Christianity must be
a divine reality."

As our ideas of Deity become more spiritual, we express them by
objects more beautiful. To-day we clothe our thoughts of death with
flowers laid upon the bier, and in our cemeteries with amaranth
blossoms, evergreen leaves, fragrant recesses, cool grottos, smiling
fountains, and white monuments. The dismal gray stones of church-yards
have crumbled into decay, as our ideas of Life have grown more
spiritual; and in place of "bat and owl on the bending stones, are
wreaths of immortelles, and white fingers pointing upward." Thus it is
that our ideas of divinity form our models of humanity. O Christian
Scientist, thou of the church of the new-born; awake to a higher and
holier love for God and man; put on the whole armor of Truth; rejoice
in hope; be patient in tribulation,--that ye may go to the bed of
anguish, and look upon this dream of life in matter, girt with a
higher sense of omnipotence; and behold once again the power of divine
Life and Love to heal and reinstate man in God's own image and
likeness, having "one Lord, one faith, one baptism."
