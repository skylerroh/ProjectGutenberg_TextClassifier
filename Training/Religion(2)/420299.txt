                         [Translation]

                    _Altar-Prayer_ (to Laka)

                This my wish, my burning desire,
                That in the season of slumber
                Thy spirit my soul may inspire,
                  Altar-dweller,
            5     Heaven-guest,
                  Soul-awakener,
                Bird from covert calling,
                Where forest champions stand.
                There roamed I too with Laka,
[Page 44]  10   Of Lea and Loa a wilderness-child;
                On ridge, in forest boon companion she
                To the heart that throbbed in me.
                  O Laka, O Laka,
                Hark to my call!
           15   You approach, it is well;
                You possess me, I am blest!

           [Footnote 71: _Lea_. The same as Laia, or probably Haumea.]

           [Footnote 72: _Wahie loa_. This must be a mistake. Laka the
           son of Wahie-loa was a great voyager. His canoe
           (_kau-meli-eli_) was built for him by the gods. In it he
           sailed to the South to rescue his father's bones from the
           witch who had murdered him. This Laka had his home at
           Kipahulu, Maui, and is not to be confounded with Laka,
           goddess of the hula.]

           In the translation of this pule the author has found it
           necessary to depart from the verse arrangement that obtains
           in the Hawaiian text.

           The religious services of the halau, though inspired by one
           motive, were not tied to a single ritual or to one set of
           prayers. Prayer marked the beginning and the ending of every
           play--that is, of every dance--and of every important event
           in the programme of the halau; but there were many prayers
           from which the priest might select. After the prayer
           specially addressed to Laka the visitor might use a petition
           of more general scope. Such is 'the one now to be given:

           He Pule Kuahu (ia Kane ame Kapo); _a he Pule Hoolei_

                Kane, hikii a'e, he malama [73] la luna;

           [Footnote 73: _ Malama_. Accented on the penult, as here, the
           word means to enlighten or a light (same in second verse). In
           the third and fourth verses the accent is changed to the
           first syllable, and the word here means to preserve, to
           foster. These words furnish an example of poetical
           word-repetition.]

           [Footnote 74: _Onioni._ To squirm, to dodge, to move. The

           [Footnote 77: _Hala-Hala a mea._ The ending _mea_ is perhaps
           taken from the last half of the proper name _Hau-mea_ who was
           Kapo's mother. It belongs to the land, in contrast to the
           sea, and seems to be intended to intensify and extend the
           meaning of the term previously used. The passage is
           difficult. Expert Hawaiians profess their inability to fathom
           its meaning.]

           that runs the length of a net at its top, the _a lalo_ being
           the corresponding line at the bottom of the net. The exact
           significance of this language complimentary to Kapo can not
           be phrased compactly.]

           An _Altar-Prayer_ (to Kane and Kapo): _also a Garland-Prayer,
           used while decorating the altar_

                Now, Kane, approach, illumine the altar;
                Stoop, and enlighten mortals below;
                Rejoice in the gifts I have brought.
                Wreathed goddess fostered by Kapo--
            5   Hail Kapo, of beauty resplendent!
                Great Kapo, of sea and land,
                The topmost stay of the net,
                Its lower stay and anchoring line.
                Kapo sits in her darksome covert;
           10   On the terrace, at Mo'o-he-laia,
                Stands the god-tree of Ku, on Mauna-loa.
                God Kaulana-ula twigs now mine ear,
                His whispered suggestion to me is
                This payment, sacrifice, offering,
           15   Tribute of praise to thee, O Kapo divine.
                Inspiring spirit in sleep, answer my call.
                Behold, of Iehua bloom of Kaana
                The women are stringing enough
                To enwreath goddess Kapo;
           20   Kapo, great queen of that island,
                Of the high and the low.
                The day of revealing shall see what it sees:
[Page 46]       A seeing of facts, a sifting of rumors,
                An insight won by the black sacred awa,
           25   A vision like that of a god!
                O Kapo, return!
                Return, and abide in your altar!
                Make it fruitful!
                Lo, here is the water,
           30   The water of life!
                Hail, now, to thee!

           The little god-folk, whom the ancients called Kini
           Akua--myriads of gods--and who made the wildwoods and
           wilderness their playground, must also be placated. They were
           a lawless set of imps; the elfins, brownies, and kobolds of
           our fairy world were not "up to them" in wanton deviltry. If
           there is to be any luck in the house, it can only be when
           they are dissuaded from outbreaking mischief.

           The pule next given is a polite invitation to these little
           brown men of the woods to honor the occasion with their
           presence and to bring good luck at their coming. It is such a
           prayer as the visitor might choose to repeat at this time, or
           it might be used on other occasions, as at the consecration
           of the kuahu:


                _He Pule Kuahu_ (no Kini Akua)

                E ulu, e ulu, Kini o ke Akua!
                Ulu Kane me Kanaloa!
                Ulu Ohi'a-lau-koa, me ka Ie-ie!
                A'e mai a noho i kou kuahu!
            5   Eia ka wai la, he wai e ola.
                E ola no, e-e!

                           [Translation]

                _An Altar-Prayer_ (to the Kini Akua)

                Gather, oh gather, ye hosts of godlings!
                Come Kane with Kanaloa!
                Come leafy Ohi'a and I-e!
                Possess me and dwell in your altar!
            5   Here's water, water of life!
                Life, give us life!

           The visitor, having satisfied his sense of what the occasion
           demands, changes his tone from that of cantillation to
           ordinary speech, and concludes his worship with a petition
           conceived in the spirit of the following prayer:

           E ola ia'u, i ka malihini; a pela hoi na kamaaina, ke kumu,
           na haumana, ia oe, e Laka. E Laka ia Pohaku i ka wawae. E
           Laka i ke kupe'e. E Laka ia Luukia i ka pa-u; e Laka i ke
           kuhi; e Laka i ka leo; e Laka i ka lei. E Laka i ke ku ana
           imua o ke anaina.
[Page 47]

                                 [Translation]

           Thy blessing, O Laka, on me the stranger, and on the
           residents, teacher and pupils. O Laka, give grace to the feet
           of Pohaku; and to her bracelets and anklets; comeliness to
           the figure and skirt of Luukia. To (each one) give gesture
           and voice. O Laka, make beautiful the lei; inspire the
           dancers when they stand before the assembly.

           At the close of this service of song and prayer the visitor
           will turn from the kuahu and exchange salutations and
           greetings with his friends in the halau.

           The song-prayer "Now, Kane, approach, illumine the altar" (p.
           45) calls for remark. It brings up again the question,
           previously discussed, whether there were not two distinct
           cults of worshipers, the one devoted to Laka, the other to
           Kapo. The following facts will throw light on the question.
           On either side of the approach to the altar stood,
           sentinel-like, a tall stem of hala-pepe, a graceful, slender
           column, its head of green sword-leaves and scarlet drupes
           making a beautiful picture. (See p. 24.) These are said to
           have been the special emblems of the goddess Kapo.

           The following account of a conversation the author had with
           an old woman, whose youthful days were spent as a hula
           dancer, will also help to disentangle the subject and explain
           the relation of Kapo to the hula:

           "Will you not recite again the prayer you just now uttered,
           and slowly, that it may be written down?" the author asked of
           her. "Many prayers for the kuahu have been collected, but
           this one differs from them all."

           "We Hawaiians," she answered, "have been taught that these
           matters are sacred (_kapu_) and must not be bandied about
           from mouth to mouth."

           "Aye, but the time of the tabus has passed. Then, too, in a
           sense having been initiated into hula matters, there can be
           no impropriety in my dealing with them in a kindly spirit."

           "No harm, of course, will come to you, a _haole_ (foreigner).
           The question is how it will affect us."

           "Tell me, were there two different classes of worshipers, one
           class devoted to the worship of Laka and another class
           devoted to the worship of Kapo?"

           "No," she answered, "Kapo and Laka were one in spirit, though
           their names were two."

           "Haumea was the mother of Kapo. Who was her father?"

           "Yes, Haumea was the mother, and Kua-ha-ilo [86] was the
           father:"

           "How about Laka?"

           [Footnote 86: _Kua-ha-ilo._ A god of the _kahuna anaana;_
           meaning literally to breed maggots in the back.]
[Page 48]
           "Laka was the daughter of Kapo. Yet as a patron, of the hula
           Laka stands first; she was worshiped at an earlier date than
           Kapo; but they are really one."

           Further questioning brought out the explanation that Laka was
           not begotten in ordinary generation; she was a sort of
           emanation from Kapo. It was as if the goddess should sneeze
           and a deity should issue with the breath from her nostrils;
           or should wink, and thereby beget spiritual offspring from
           the eye, or as if a spirit should issue forth at some
           movement of the ear or mouth.

           When the old woman's; scruples had been laid to rest, she
           repeated slowly for the author's benefit the pule given on
           pages 45 and 46, "Now, Kane, approach," ... of which the
           first eight lines and much of the last part, to him, were
           new.

                      VIII.--COSTUME OF THE HULA DANCER


           The costume of the hula dancer was much the same for both
           sexes, its chief article a simple short skirt about the
           waist, the pa-u. (PL I.)

           When the time has come for a dance, the halau becomes one
           common dressing room. At a signal from the kumu the work
           begins. The putting on of each article of costume is
           accompanied by a special song.

           First come the _ku-pe'e_, anklets of whale teeth, bone,
           shell-work, dog-teeth, fiber-stuffs, and what not. While all
           stoop in unison they chant the song of the anklet:


                             _Mele Ku-pe'e_

                Aala kupukupu[87] ka uka o Kane-hoa.[88]
                E ho-a![89]
                Hoa na lima o ka makani, he Wai-kaloa.[90]
                He Wai-kaloa ka makani anu Lihue.
            5   Alina[91] lehua i kau ka opua--
                Ku'u pua,
                Ku'u pua i'ini e ku-i a lei.
                Ina ia oe ke lei 'a mai la.

                              [Translation]

                              _Anklet-Song_

                Fragrant the grasses of high. Kane-hoa.
                Bind on the anklets, bind!
                Bind with finger deft as the wind
                That cools the air of this bower.
            5   Lehua bloom pales at my flower,
                O sweetheart of mine,
                Bud that I'd pluck and wear in my wreath,
                If thou wert but a flower!

           [Footnote 87: _Kupukupu_. Said to be a fragrant grass.]

           [Footnote 88: _Kane-hoa_. Said to be a hill at Kaupo, Maul.
           Another person says it is a hill at Lihue, on Oahu. The same
           name is often repeated.]

           [Footnote 89: _Ho-a_. To bind. An instance of word-repetition,
           common in Hawaiian poetry.]

           [Footnote 90: _Wai-kaloa_. A cool wind that Wows at Lihue,
           Kauai]

           [Footnote 91: _Alina_. A scar, or other mark of disfigurement,
           a moral blemish. In ancient times lovers inflicted injuries
           on themselves to prove devotion.]

           The short skirt, _pa-u_, was the most important piece of
           attire worn by the Hawaiian female. As an article of daily
           wear it represented many stages of evolution beyond the
           primitive fig-leaf, being fabricated from a great variety of
[Page 50]  materials furnished by the garden of nature. In its simplest
           terms the pa-u was a mere fringe of vegetable fibers. When
           placed as the shield of modesty about the loins of a woman of
           rank, or when used as the full-dress costume of a dancing
           girl on a ceremonious occasion, it took on more elaborate
           forms, and was frequently of _tapa_, a fabric the finest
           specimens of which would not have shamed the wardrobe of an
           empress.

           In the costuming of the hula girl the same variety obtained
           as in the dress of a woman of rank. Sometimes her pa-u would
           be only a close-set fringe of ribbons stripped from the bark
           of the hibiscus (_hau_), the _ti_ leaf or banana fiber, or a
           fine rush, strung upon a thong to encircle the waist. In its
           most elaborate and formal style the pa-u consisted of a strip
           of fine tapa several yards long and of width to reach nearly
           to the knees. It was often delicately tinted or printed, as
           to its outer part, with stamped figures. The part of the tapa
           skirt thus printed, like the outer, decorative one in a set
           of tapa bed-sheets, was termed the _kilohana_.

           The pa-u worn by the danseuse, when of tapa, was often of
           such volume as to balloon like the skirt of a coryphee. To
           put it on was quite an art, and on that account, if not on
           the score of modesty, a portion of the halau, was screened
           off and devoted to the use of the females as a dressing room,
           being known as the _unu-lau-koa_, and to this place they
           repaired as soon as the kumu gave the signal for dressing.

           The hula pa-u of the women was worn in addition to that of
           daily life; the hula pa-u of the men, a less pretentious
           affair, was worn outside the malo, and in addition to it.

           The method of girding on the pa-u was peculiar. Beginning at
           the right hip--some say the left--a free end was allowed to
           hang quite to the knee; then, passing across the back,
           rounding the left hip, and returning by way of the abdomen to
           the starting point, another circuit of the waist was
           accomplished; and, a reverse being made, the garment was
           secured by passing the bight of the tapa beneath the hanging
           folds of the pa-u from below upward until it slightly
           protruded above the border of the garment at the waist. This
           second end was thus brought to hang down the hip alongside of
           the first free end; an arrangement that produced a most
           decorative effect.

           The Hawaiians, in their fondness for giving personal names to
           inanimate objects, named the two free ends (_apua_) of the
           pa-u respectively _Ku-kapu-ula-ka-lani_ and _Lele-a-mahu'i_.

           According to another method, which was simpler and more
           commonly employed, the piece was folded sidewise and, being
           gathered into pleats, a cord was inserted the length of the
           fold. The cord was passed about the waist, knotted at the
           hip, and thus held the garment secure.

           While the girls are making their simple toilet and donning
           their unique, but scanty, costume, the kumu, aided by others,
           soothes the impatience of the audience and stimulates their
           imagination by cantillating a mele that sets forth in
           grandiloquent imagery the praise of the pa-u.

           [Footnote 99: _Kau-kini_. The name of a hill back of
           Lahaina-luna, the traditional residence of a _kahuna_ named
           _Lua-hoo-moe_, whose two sons were celebrated for their manly
           beauty. Ole-pau, the king of the island Maui, ordered his
           retainer, Lua-hoo-moe, to fetch for his eating some young
           _u-a'u_, a sea-bird that nests and rears its young in the
           mountains. These young birds are esteemed a delicacy. The
           kahuna, who was a bird-hunter, truthfully told the king that
           it was not the season for the young birds; the parent birds
           were haunting the ocean. At this some of the king's boon
           companions, moved by ill-will, charged the king's mountain
           retainer with suppressing the truth, and in proof they
           brought some tough old birds caught at sea and had them
           served for the king's table. Thereupon the king, not
           discovering the fraud, ordered that Lua-hoo-moe should be put
           to death by fire. The following verses were communicated to
           the author as apropos of Kau-kini, evidently the name of a
           man:

                Ike ia Kau-kini, he lawaia manu.
                He upena ku'u i ka noe i Poha-kahi,
                Ua hoopulu ia i ka ohu ka kikepa;
                Ke na'i la i ka luna a Kea-auwana;
                Ka uahi i ke ka-peku e hei ai ka manu o Pu-o-alii.
                O ke alii wale no ka'u i makemake
                Ali'a la, ha'o, e!

                            [Translation]

                Behold Kau-kini, a fisher of birds;
                Net spread in the mist of Poha-kahi,
                That is soaked by the sidling fog.
                It strives on the crest of Koa-auwana.
                Smoke traps the birds of Pu-o-alii.
                It's only the king that I wish:
                But stay now--I doubt.
