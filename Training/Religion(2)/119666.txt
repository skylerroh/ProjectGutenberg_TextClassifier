of the three subjects, or agents, constituting the Godhead.     6

In Christian Science we learn that God is definitely indi-
vidual and not a _person_, as that word is used by the best
authorities, if our lexicographers are right in defining        9
_person_ as especially a finite _human being_; but God is
personal, if by _person_ is meant infinite Spirit.

We do not conceive rightly of God, if we think of Him           12
as less than infinite.  The human person is finite; and
therefore I prefer to retain the proper sense of Diety by
using the phrase _an individual_ God rather than _a per-        15
sonal_ God; for there is and can be but on infinite indi-
vidual spirit, who mortals have named God.

Science defines the individuality of God as supreme             18
good, Life, Truth, Love.  This term enlarges our sense
of Diety, takes away the trammels assigned to God by
finite though, and introduces us to higher definitions.         21

_Is healing the sick the whole of Science?_

Healing physical sickness is the smallest part of Chris-
tian Science.  It is only the bugle-call to thought and         24
action, in the higher range of infinite goodness.  The
emphatic purpose of Christian Science is the healing of
sin; and this task, sometimes, may be harder than the           27
cure of disease; because, while mortals love to sin, they       1
do not love to be sick.  Hence their comparative acqui-
escence in your endeavors to heal them of bodily ills, and      3
their obstinate resistance to all efforts to save them from
sin through Christ, spiritual Truth and Love, which
redeem them, and become their Saviour, through the              6
flesh, from the flesh, -- the material world and evil.

This Life, Truth, and Love -- this trinity of good -- was
individualized, to the perception of mortal sense, in the       9
man Jesus.  His history is emphatic in our hearts, and it
lives more because of his spiritual than his physical healing.
His example is, to Christian Scientists, what the models        12
of the masters in music and painting are to artists.

Genuine Christian Scientists will no more deviate mor-
ally from that divine digest of Science called the Sermon       15
on the Mount, than they will manipulate invalids, prescribe
drugs, or deny God.  Jesus' healing was spiritual in its
nature, method, and design.  He wrought the cure of             18
disease through the divine Mind, which gives all true
volition, impulse, and action; and destroys the mental
error made manifest physically, and establishes the oppo-       21
site manifestation of Truth upon the body in harmony
and health.

_By the individuality of God, do you mean that God has_          24
_a finite form?_

No.  I mean the infinite and divine Principle of all
being, the ever-present I AM, filling all space, including      27
in itself all Mind, the one Father-Mother God.  Life,           1
Truth, and Love are this trinity in unity, and their uni-
verse is spiritual, peopled with perfect beings, harmonious     3
and eternal, of which our material universe and men are
the counterfeits.

_Is God the Principle of all science, or only of Divine or_     6
_Christian Science?_

Science is Mind manifested.  It is not material; neither
is it of human origin.                                          9

All true Science represents a moral and spiritual force,
which holds the earth in its orbit.  This force is Spirit,
that can "bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades," and       12
"loose the bands of Orion."

There is no material science, if by that term you mean
material intelligence.  God is infinite Mind, hence there       15
is no other Mind.  Good is Mind, but evil is not Mind.
Good is not in evil, but in God only. Spirit is not in matter,
but in Spirit only. Law is not in matter, but in Mind only.     18

_Is there no matter?_

All is Mind.  According to the Scriptures and Christian
Science, all is God, and there is naught beside Him.  "God      21
is Spirit;" and we can only learn and love Him through
His spirit, which brings out the fruits of Spirit and ex-
tinguishes forever the works of darkness by His marvel-         24
lous light.

The five material senses testify to the existence of
matter.  The spiritual senses afford no such evidence,          1
but deny the testimony of the material senses.  Which
testimony is correct?  The Bible says: "Let God be              3
true, and every man a liar."  If, as the Scriptures imply,
God is All-in-all, then all must be Mind, since God is
Mind.  Therefore in divine Science there is no material         6
mortal man, for man is spiritual and eternal, he being
made in the image of Spirit, or God.

There is no material sense.  Matter is inert, inanimate,        9
and sensationless, -- considered apart from Mind.  Lives
there a man who has ever found Soul in the body or in
matter, who has ever seen spiritual substance with the          12
eye, who has found sight in matter, hearing in the material
ear, or intelligence in non-intelligence?  If there is any
such thing as matter, it must be either mind which is           15
called matter, or matter without Mind.

Matter without Mind is a moral impossibility.  Mind
in matter is pantheism.  Soul is the only real conscious-       18
ness which cognizes being.  The body does not see, hear,
smell, or taste.  Human belief says that it does; but
destroy this belief of seeing with the eye, and we could        21
not see materially; and so it is with each of the physical
senses.

Accepting the verdict of these material senses, we should       24
believe man and the universe to be the football of chance
and sinking into oblivion.   Destroy the five senses as
organized matter, and you must either become non-exist-         27
ent, or exist in Mind only; and this latter conclusion is
the simple solution of the problem of being, and leads to       1
the equal inference that there is no matter.
