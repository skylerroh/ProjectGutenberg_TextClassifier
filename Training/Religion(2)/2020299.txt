           [Footnote 379: _Makua._ A valley in Waianae.]

           [Footnote 380: _One opio-pio._ Sand freshly smoothed by an
           ocean wave.]

           [Footnote 381: _Apo'i-po'i._ To crouch for the purpose,
           perhaps, of screening oneself from view, as one, for
           instance, who is naked and desires to escape observation.]

           [Footnote 382: _Kilauea._ There is some doubt whether this is
           the Kilauea on Kauai or a little place of the same name near
           cape Kaeua, the westernmost point of Oahu.]
[Page 204]
           In the next mele to be given it is evident that, though the
           motive is clearly Hawaiian, it has lost something of the
           rugged simplicity and impersonality that belonged to the most
           archaic style, and that it has taken on the sentimentality of
           a later period.

                    Come now, Manono,
                    Come, Manono, I say;
                    Take up the burden;
                    Through groves of pandanus
                5   And wild stag-horn fern,
                    Wearisome fern, lies our way.
                    Arrived at the hill-top,
                    We'll smooth out the nest,
                    That we may snug close.

               10   Turn now to me, dear,
                    While we rest here.
                    Make we a little nest,
                    That we may draw near.
                    This way your face, dear,
[Page 205]     15   While, we rest here.
                    Rest thou and I here,
                    Near the warm, warm water
                    And the smooth lava-plate
                    Of Mau-kele.

           Manono was the name of the brave woman, wife of
           Ke-kua-o-kalani, who fell in the battle of Kuamo'o, in Kona,
           Hawaii, in 1819, fighting by the side of her husband. They
           died in support of the cause of law and order, of religion
           and tabu, the cause of the conservative party in Hawaii, as
           opposed to license and the abolition of all restraint.

           The _uluhe_ (verses 5, 6) is the stag-horn fern, which forms
           a matted growth most obstructive to woodland travel.

           The burden Manono is asked to bear, what else is it but the
           burden of life, in this case lightened by love?

           Whether there is any connection between the name of the
           hula--breast-beating--and the expression, in the first verse
           of the following mele is more than the author can say.

           and was hospitably received by Ka-ahu-pahau and Ka-hi'u-ka,
           sharks of the Ewa lagoons, who had a human ancestry and were
           on friendly terms with their kindred. Miko-lo-lou, when his
           hosts denied him human flesh, helped himself. In the conflict
           that rose the Ewa sharks joined with their human relatives
           and friends on land to put an end to Miko-lo-lou. After a
           fearful contest they took him and reduced his body to ashes.
           A dog, however, snatched and ate a portion--some say the
           tongue, some the tail--and another part fell into the water.
           This was reanimated by the spirit of the dead shark and grew
           to be a monster of the same size and power as the one
           deceased. Miko-lo-lou now gathered his friends and allies
           from all the waters and made war against the Ewa sharks, but

           herbs--they abound everywhere in Hawaii--at the same time
           representing them as casting longing glances on the

           pictures composing this mele is slight. It will, perhaps,
           give to the whole a more definite meaning if we recognize
           that it is made up of snapshots at various objects and
           localities that presented themselves to one passing along the
           old road from Kahuku, on Oahu, to the high land which gave
           the tired traveler his first distant view of Honolulu before
           he entered the winding canyon of Moana-lua.

                           XXVI.--THE HULA KU'I MOLOKAI


           The hula _ku'i Molokai_ was a variety of the Hawaiian dance
           that originated on the island of Molokai, probably at a later
           period than what one would call the classic times. Its
           performance extended to the other islands. The author has
           information of its exhibition on the island of its name as
           late as the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The
           actors, as they might be called, in this hula were arranged
           in pairs who faced each other and went through motions
           similar to those of boxing. This action, _ku'i_, to smite,
           gave the name to the performance. The limiting word Molokai
           was added to distinguish it from another still more modern
           form of dance called _ku'i_, which will be described later.

           While the performers stood and went through with their
           motions, marching and countermarching, as they are said to
           have done, they chanted or recited in recitative some song,
           of which the following is an example. This they did with no
           instrumental accompaniment:

                          _Mele_

                He ala kai olohia,[389]
                He hiwahiwa na ka la'i luahine,
                He me' aloha na'u ka makani hauai-loli,[390]
                E uwe ana I ke kai pale iliahi.
            5   Kauwa ke aloha i na lehua o Kaana.[391]
                Pomaikai au i kou aloha e noho nei;
                Ka haluku wale no ia a ka waimaka,
                Me he makamaka puka a la
                Ke aloha i ke kanaka,
           10   E ho-iloli nei i ku'u nui kino.
                Mahea hoi au, a?
                Ma ko oe alo no.

           [Footnote 389: _Kai olohia_. A calm and tranquil sea. This
           expression has gained a poetic vogue that almost makes it
           pass current as a single word, meaning tranquillity, calmness
           of mind. As thus explained, it is here translated by the
           expression "heart's-ease."]

           [Footnote 390: _Makani hanai-loli_. A wind so gentle as not to
           prevent the beche de mer _loli_ sea-anemones, and other
           marine slugs from coming out of their holes to feed. A
           similar figure is used in the next line in the expression
           _kai pale iliahi_. The thought is that the calmness of the
           ocean invites one to strip and plunge in for a bath.]

           [Footnote 391: _Kauwa ke aloha i na lehua o Kaana_. Kaana is
           said to be a hill on the road from Keaau to Olaa, a spot
           where travelers were wont to rest and where they not
           infrequently made up wreaths of the scarlet lehua bloom which
           there abounded. It took a large number of lehua flowers to
           suffice for a wreath, and to bind them securely to the fillet
           that made them a garland was a work demanding not only
           artistic skill hut time and patience. If a weary traveler,
           halting at Kaana, employed his time of rest in plaiting
           flowers into a wreath for some loved one, there would be
           truth as well as poetry in the saying, "Love slaves for the
           lehuas of Kaana."]
[Page 208]
                         [Translation]

                            _Song_

                Precious the gift of heart's-ease,
                A wreath for the cheerful dame;
                So dear to my heart is the breeze
                That murmurs, strip for the ocean.
            5   Love slaves for wreaths from Kaana.
                I'm blest in your love that reigns here;
                It speaks in the fall of a tear--
                The choicest thing in one's life,
                This love for a man by his wife--
           10   It has power to shake the whole frame.
                Ah, where am I now?
                Here, face to your face.

           The platitudes of mere sentimentalism, when put into cold
           print, are not stimulating to the imagination; moods and
           states of feeling often approaching the morbid, their oral
           expression needs the reenforcement of voice, tone,
           countenance, the whole attitude. They are for this reason
           most difficult of translation and when rendered literally
           into a foreign speech often become meaningless. The figures
           employed also, like the watergourds and wine-skins of past
           generations and of other peoples, no longer appeal to us as
           familiar objects, but require an effort of the imagination to
           make them intelligible and vivid to our mental vision. If the
           translator carries these figures of speech over into his new
           rendering, they will often demand an explanation on their own
           account, and will thus fail of their original intent; while
           if he clothes the thought in some new figure he takes the
           risk of failing to do justice to the intimate meaning of the
           original. The force of these remarks will become apparent
           from an analysis of the prominent figures of speech that
           occur in the mele.

           of 1868 this spouting horn ceased action. The rending force
           of the earthquakes must have broken up and choked the
           subterranean channel through which the ocean had forced its
           way.]

                A tide that flowed long ago;
                The water-spring of Mana,
                Life-spring for the people,
           10   A fount where the lapping dog
                Barks at the incoming wave,
                Drifting spray on the bloom
                Of the sand-sprawling ili-au
                And the scarlet flower of ohai,
           15   On the wind-woven mat of wild grass,
                Long naku, a springy mattress.
                The spout-horn, Kawelo-hea,
                Asks, Who of right has the tabu?
                The princess Nahi-ena-ena!
           20   The flowers glow in the pool,
                The bathing pool of Holei!

           This mele inoa--name-song or eulogy--was composed in
           celebration of the lamented princess, Nahienaena, who, before
           she was misled by evil influences, was a most attractive and
           promising character. She was the daughter of Keopuolani and
           younger sister of Kamehameha III, and came to her untimely
           death in 1836. The name was compounded from the words _na_,
           the, _ahi_, fires, and _enaena_, hot, a meaning which
           furnishes the motive to the mele.

                           XXVII.--THE HULA KIELEI


           The hula _ki-e-lei_, or _ki-le-lei_, was a performance of
           Hawaii's classic times, and finds mention as such in the
           professedly imperfect list of hulas given by the historian
           David Malo.[395] It was marked by strenuous bodily action,
           gestures with feet and hands, and that vigorous exercise of
           the pelvis and body termed _ami_, the chief feature of which
           was a rotation of the pelvis in circles and ellipses, which
           is not to be regarded as an effort to portray sexual
           attitudes. It was a performance in which the whole company
           stood and chanted the mele without instrumental
           accompaniment.

           [Footnote 395: Hawaiian Antiquities, by David Malo; translated
           by N.B. Emerson, A.M., M.D. Honolulu, the Hawaiian Gazette
           Company (Limited), 1903.]

           The sacrifice offered at the kuahu in connection with the
           production of this hula consisted of a black pig, a cock of
           the color termed ula-hiwa--black pointed with red--a white
           hen, and awa. According to some authorities the offerings
           deemed appropriate for the sacrifice that accompanied each
           hula varied with the hula, but was definitely established for
           each variety of hula. The author's studies, however, lead him
           to conclude that, whatever may have been the original demands
           of the gods, in the long run they were not overparticular and
           were not only willing to put up with, but were well pleased
           so long as the offering contained, good pork or fish and
           strong awa.

           [Footnote 401: _Ki-ki'i ka na i ka nana keia, la_. The meaning
           of this passage is obscure. The most plausible view is that
           this is an exclamation made by one of the two travelers while
           crouching for shelter under an overhanging bank. This one,
           finding himself unprotected, exclaims to his companion on the
           excellence of the shelter he has found, whereupon the second
           man comes over to share his comfort only to find that he has
           been hoaxed and that the deceiver has stolen his former
           place. The language of the text seems a narrow foundation on
           which to base such an incident. A learned Hawaiian friend,
           however, finds it all implied in this passage.]

                Perilous, steep, is the climb to Hanalei woods;
                To walk canny footed over its bogs;

                And toil up ladder of hanging roots.
            5   The bulk of my guide overhangs me,
                His loins are well-nigh exhausted;
                Two beautiful shapes!
                'Neath this bank I crouch sheltered from rain.

           At first blush this mele seems to be the account of a
           perilous climb through that wild mountainous region that lies
           back of Hanalei, Kauai, a region of tangled woods, oozy
           steeps, fathomless bogs, narrow ridges, and overhanging
           cliffs that fall away into profound abysses, making such an
           excursion a most precarious adventure. This is what appears
           on the surface. Hawaiian poets, however, did not indulge in
           landscape-painting for its own sake; as a rule, they had some
           ulterior end in view, and that end was the portrayal of some
           primal human passion, ambition, hate, jealousy, love,
           especially love. Guided by this principle, one asks what
           uncouth or romantic love adventure this wild mountain climb
           symbolizes. All the Hawaiians whom the author has consulted
           on this question deny any hidden meaning to this mele.

                         XXVIII.--THE HULA MU'U-MU'U


           The conception of this peculiar hula originated from a
           pathetic incident narrated in the story of Hiiaka's journey
           to bring Prince Lohiau to the court of Pele. Haiika, standing
           with her friend Wahine-oma'o on the heights that overlooked
           the beach at Kahakuloa, Maui, saw the figure of a woman,
           maimed as to hands and feet, dancing in fantastic glee on a
           plate of rock by the ocean. She sang as she danced, pouring
           out her soul in an ecstasy that ill became her pitiful
           condition; and as she danced her shadow-dance, for she was
           but a ghost, poor soul! these were the words she repeated:

                Auwe, auwe, mo' ku'u lima!
                Auwe, auwe, mo' ku'u lima!

                      [Translation]

                Alas, alas, maimed are my hands!
                Alas, alas, maimed are my hands!

           Wahine-oma'o, lacking spiritual sight, saw nothing of this;
           but Hiiaka, in downright pity and goodness of impulse,
           plucked a hala fruit from the string about her neck and threw
           it so that it fell before the poor creature, who eagerly
           seized it and with the stumps of her hands held it up to
           enjoy its odor. At the sight of the woman's pleasure Hiiaka
           sang:

                Le'a wale hoi ka wahine lima-lima ole, wawae ole,
                E ha ana i kana i'a, ku'i-ku'i ana i kana opihi,
                Wa'u-wa'u ana i kana limu, Mana-mana-ia-kalu-e-a.

                               [Translation]

                How pleased is the girl maimed of hand and foot,
                Groping for fish, pounding shells of opihi,
                Kneading her moss, Mana-mana-ia-kalu-ea!

           The answer of the desolate creature, grateful for Hiiaka's
           recognition and kind attention, was that pretty mele
           appropriated by hula folk as the wreath-song, already given
           (p. 56), which will bear repetition:

                Ke lei mai la o Ka-ula i ke kai, e-e!
                Ke malamalama o Niihau, ua malie.
                A malie, pa ka Inu-wai.
                Ke inu mai la na hala o Naue i ke kai.
            5   No Naue ka hala, no Puna ka wahine,
                No ka lua no i Kilauea.
[Page 213]

                          [Translation]

                Kaula wreathes her brow with the ocean;
                Niihau shines forth in the calm.
                After the calm blows the Inu-wai,
                And the palms of Naue drink of the salt.
            5   From Naue the palm, from Puna the maid,
                Aye, from the pit of Kilauea.

           The hula _mu'u-mu'u_, literally the dance of the maimed, has
           long been out of vogue, so that the author has met with but
           one person, and he not a practitioner of the hula, who has
           witnessed its performance. This was in Puna, Hawaii; the
           performance was by women only and was without instrumental
           accompaniment. The actors were seated in a half-reclining
           position, or kneeling. Their arms, as if in imitation of a
           maimed person, were bent at the elbows and doubled up, so
           that their gestures were made with the upper arms. The mele
           they cantillated went as follows:

                Pii ana a-ama,[402]
                A-ama kai nui;
                Kai pua-lena;
                A-ama, pai-e-a,[403]
            5   Naholo i lea laupapa.
                Popo'i, popo'i, popo'i!
                Pii mai pipipi,[404] alea-lea;
                Noho i ka malua kai
                O-u,[405] o-i kela.
           10   Ai ka limu akaha-kaha;[406]
                Ku e, Kahiki, i ke kai nui!
                I ke kai pualena a Kane!
