The promises of the covenant of grace, Isa. 55. 1 2.
Zech. 13. 1. Mich. 7. 19. Ezek. 36. 25 &c.

1 In vain we lavish out our lives
To gather empty wind,
The choicest blessings earth can yield
Will starve a hungry mind.

2 Come and the Lord shall feed our souls
With more substantial meat,
With such as saints in glory love,
With such as angels eat.

3 Our God will every want supply,
And fill our hearts with peace;
He gives by covenant and by oath
The riches of his grace.

4 Come, and he'll cleanse our spotted souls,
And wash away our stains,
In the dear fountain that his Son
Pour'd from his dying veins.

5 [Our guilt shall vanish all away
Tho' black as hell before;
Our sins shall sink beneath the sea,
And shall be found no more.

6 And lest pollution should o'erspread
Our inward powers again,
His Spirit shall bedew our souls
Like purifying rain.]

7 Our heart, that flinty stubborn thing,
That terrors cannot move,
That fears no threat'nings of his wrath,
Shall be dissolv'd by love;

8 Or he can take the flint away
That would not be refin'd,
And from the treasures of his grace
Bestow a softer mind.

9 There shall his sacred Spirit dwell,
And deep engrave his law,
And every motion of our souls
To swift obedience draw.

10 Thus will he pour salvation down,
And we shall render praise,
We the dear people of his love,
And he our God of grace.


Hymn 1:10.
The blessedness of gospel times; or, The revelation of
Christ to Jews and Gentiles, Isa. 5. 2 7-10. Matt.
13. 16 17.

1 How beauteous are their feet
Who stand on Zion's hill!
Who bring salvation on their tongues,
And words of peace reveal!

2 How charming is their voice!
How sweet the tidings are!
"Zion, behold thy Saviour King,
He reigns and triumphs here."

3 How happy are our ears
That hear this joyful sound,
Which kings and prophets waited for,
And sought, but never found!

4 How blessed are our eyes
That see this heavenly light!
Prophets and kings desir'd it long,
But dy'd without the sight.

5 The watchmen join their voice,
And tuneful notes employ;
Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,
And deserts leant the joy.

6 The Lord makes bare his arm
Thro' all the earth abroad
Let every nation now behold
Their Saviour and their God.


Hymn 1:11.
The humble enlightened, and carnal reason humbled;
or, The sovereignty of grace, Luke 10. 21 22

1 There was an hour when Christ rejoic'd,
And spoke his joy in words of praise;
"Father, I thank thee, mighty God,
"Lord of the earth, and heavens, and seas.

2 "I thank thy sovereign power and love,
"That crowns my doctrine with success;
"And makes the babes in knowledge learn
"The heights, and breadths, and lengths of grace.

3 "But all this glory lies conceal'd
"From men of prudence and of wit;
"The prince of darkness blinds their eyes,
"And their own pride resists the light.

4 "Father, 'tis thus, because thy will
"Chose and ordain'd it should be so;
"T'is thy delight t' abase the proud,
"And lay the haughty scorner low.

5 "There's none can know the Father right
"But those who learn it from the Son;
"Nor can the Son be well receiv'd,
But where the Father makes him known."

6 Then let our souls adore our God
That deals his graces as he please,
Nor gives to mortals an account
Or of his actions, or decrees.


Hymn 1:12.
Free grace in revealing Christ, Luke 10. 21.

1 Jesus, the man of constant grief,
A mourner all his days;
His spirit once rejoic'd aloud,
And tun'd his joy to praise.

2 "Father, I thank thy wondrous love,
"That hath reveal'd thy Son
"To men unlearned; and to babes
"Has made thy gospel known.

3 "The mysteries of redeeming grace
"Are hidden from the wise,
"While pride and carnal reasonings join
"To swell and blind their eyes."

4 Thus doth the Lord of heaven and earth
His great decrees fulfil,
And orders all his works of grace
By his own sovereign will.


Hymn 1:13.
The Son of God incarnate; or, The titles and the
kingdom of Christ, Isa. 9. 2 6 7.

1 The lands that long in darkness lay
Now have beheld a heavenly light;
Nations that sat in death's cold shade
Are bless'd with beams divinely bright.

2 The virgin's promis'd Son is born,
Behold th' expected Child appear;
What shall his names or titles be?
The Wonderful, the Counsellor.

3 This infant is the mighty God
Come to be suckled and ador'd
Th' eternal Father, Prince of Peace,
The son of David, and his Lord.

4 The government of earth and seas
Upon his shoulders shall be laid
His wide dominions still increase,
And honours to his name be paid.

5 Jesus the holy child shall sit
High on his father David's throne,
Shall crush his foes beneath his feet,
And reign to ages yet unknown.


Hymn 1:14.
The triumph of faith; or, Christ's unchangeable love,
Rom. 8. 33 &c.

1 Who shall the Lord's elect condemn?
'Tis God that justifies their souls,
And mercy like a mighty stream
O'er all their sins divinely rolls.


2 Who shall adjudge the saints to hell?
'Tis Christ that suffer'd in their stead,
And the salvation to fulfil,
Behold him rising from the dead.

3 He lives, he lives, and sits above,
For ever interceding there:
Who shall divide us from his love?
Or what should tempt us to despair?

4 Shall persecution, or distress,
Famine, or sword, or nakedness?
He that hath lov'd us bears us thro',
And makes us more than conquerors too.

5 Faith hath an overcoming power,
It triumphs in the dying hour;
Christ is our life, our joy, our hope,
Nor can we sink with such a prop.

6 Not all that men on earth can do,
Nor powers on high, nor powers below,
Shall cause his mercy to remove,
Or wean our hearts from Christ our love.


Hymn 1:15.
Our own weakness, and Christ our strength,
2 Cor. 12. 7 9 10.

1 Let me but hear my Saviour say,
"Strength shall be equal to thy day,"
Then I rejoice in deep distress,
Leaning on all-sufficient Grace.

2 I glory in infirmity,
That Christ's own power may rest on me;
When I am weak, then am I strong,
Grace is my shield, and Christ my song.

3 I can do all things, or can bear
All sufferings, if my Lord be there;
Sweet pleasures mingle with the pains,
While his left hand my head sustains.

4 But if the Lord be once withdrawn,
And we attempt the work alone,
When new temptations spring and rise
We find how great our weakness is.

5 [So Samson, when his hair was lost,
Met the Philistines to his cost;
Shook his vain limbs with sad surprise,
Made feeble fight, and lost his eyes.]


Hymn 1:16.
Hosanna to Christ, Matt. 21. 9. Luke 19. 38 40.

1 Hosanna to the royal Son
Of David's ancient line,
His natures two, his person one,
Mysterious and divine.

2 The root of David here we find,
And offspring is the same;
Eternity and time are join'd
In our Immanuel's name.

3 Bless'd he that comes to wretched men
With peaceful news from heaven;
Hosannas of the highest strain
To Christ the Lord be given.

4 Let mortals ne'er refuse to take
Th' hosanna on their tongues,
Lest rocks and stones should rise, and break
Their silence into songs.


Hymn 1:17.
Victory over death, 1 Cor. 15, 55 &c.

1 O for an overcoming faith
To cheer my dying hours,
To triumph o'er the monster Death,
And all his frightful powers.

2 Joyful with all the strength I have
My quivering lips should sing,
"Where is thy boasted victory, Grave?
And where the monster's sting?"

3 If sin be pardon'd I'm secure,
Death hath no sting beside;
The law gives sin its damning power,
But Christ, my ransom, died.

4 Now to the God of victory
Immortal thanks be paid,
Who makes us conquerors while we die,
Thro' Christ our living head.


Hymn 1:18.
Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, Rev. 14. 13.

1 Hear what the voice from heaven proclaims,
For all the pious dead,
Sweet is the savour of their names,
And soft their sleeping bed.

2 They die in Jesus, and are bless'd;
How kind their slumbers are!
From sufferings and from sins releas'd,
And freed from every snare.

3 Far from this world of toil and strife,
They're present with the Lord;
The labours of their mortal life
End in a large reward.


Hymn 1:19.
The song of Simeon; or, Death made desirable,
Luke 2. 27 &c.

1 Lord at thy temple we appear,
As happy Simeon came,
And hope to meet our Saviour here;
O make our joys the same!

2 With what divine and vast delight
The good old man was fill'd,
When fondly in his wither'd arms
He clasp'd the holy child!

3 "Now I can leave this world," he cry'd,
"Behold thy servant dies,
"I've seen thy great salvation, Lord,
"And close my peaceful eyes.

4 "This is the light prepar'd to shine
"Upon the Gentile lands,
"Thine Israel's glory, and their hope
"To break their slavish bands."

5 [Jesus, the vision of thy face
Hath overpowering charms
Scarce shall I feel death's cold embrace
If Christ be in my arms.

6 Then while ye hear my heart-strings break,
How sweet my minutes roll!
A mortal paleness on my cheek,
And glory in my soul.]


Hymn 1:20.
Spiritual apparel; namely, the robe of righteousness,
and garments of salvation, Isa. 61. 10.

1 Awake, my heart, arise, my tongue,
Prepare a tuneful voice,
In God the life of all my joys,
Aloud will I rejoice.

2 'Tis he adorn'd my naked soul,
And made salvation mine,
Upon a poor polluted worm
He makes his graces shine.

3 And lest the shadow of a spot
Should on my soul be found,
He took the robe the Saviour wrought,
And cast it all around.

4 How far the heavenly robe exceeds
What earthly princes wear!
These ornaments, how bright they shine!
How white the garments are!

5 The Spirit wrought my faith and love,
And hope, and every grace;
But Jesus spent his life to work
The robe of righteousness.

6 Strangely, my soul, art thou array'd
By the great sacred Three:
In sweetest harmony of praise
Let all thy powers agree.


Hymn 1:21.
A vision of the kingdom of Christ among men,
Rev. 21. 1-4.

1 Lo, what a glorious sight appears
To our believing eyes!
The earth and sea are pass'd away,
And the old rolling skies.

2 From the third heaven where God resides,
That holy happy place,
The New Jerusalem comes down
Adorn'd with shining grace.

3 Attending angels shout for joy,
And the bright armies sing,
"Mortals, behold the sacred seat
"Of your descending King.

4 "The God of glory down to men
"Removes his blest abode,
"Men the dear objects of his grace,
"And he the loving God.

5 "His own soft hand shall wipe the tears
"From every weeping eye,
"And pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears,
"And death itself shall die."

6 How long, dear Saviour, O how long,
Shall this bright hour delay!
Fly swifter round, ye wheels of time,
And bring the welcome day.


Hymn 1:22. [Supplement.]
Flesh and Spirit. Rom. 8. 1.

1 What vain desires, and passions vain,
Attend this mortal clay!
Oft have they pierc'd my soul with pain,
And drawn my heart astray.

2 How have I wander'd from my God,
And following sin and shame
In this vile world of flesh and blood
Defil'd my nobler frame!

3 For ever blessed be thy grace
That form'd my soul anew,
And made it of an heaven-born race,
Thy glory to pursue.

4 My spirit holds perpetual war,
And wrestles and complains;
But views the happy moment near
That shall dissolve its chains.

5 Cheerful in death I close my eyes,
To part with every lust;
And charge my flesh whene'er it rise
To leave them in the dust.

6 My purer spirit shall not fear
To put this body on:
Its tempting powers no more are there,
Its lusts and passions gone.


Hymn 1:23. [Supplement.]
A hopeful youth falling short of heaven, Mark 10. 21.

1 Must all the charms of nature then
So hopeless to salvation prove?
