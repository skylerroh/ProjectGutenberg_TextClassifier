

                                PENTECOST




               {Ergo, hos palai tois mathetais epengeilo.}


                                    I

    Even as Thou saidst, the Spirit came,
    In fiery tongues of living flame;
    And men were moved to spread abroad,
    The Wisdom of th' Incarnate God.

                                   II

    And nations heard the truth, and gave
    Their souls to Him who came to save;
    And toiling in their sins, arose
    The power of Satan to oppose.

                                   III

    Even as Thou saidst; the Spirit's power
    Came at the Pentecostal hour,
    And drooping souls with zeal were fired,
    And felt the life that power inspired.

                                   IV

    Even as Thou saidst, the Spirit's voice
    Spake to dull hearts, and bade rejoice;
    And men that dwelt in sorrow's night,
    Felt hope awake as morning light.

                                    V

    Even as Thou saidst; His power can still
    Our empty lives to fulness fill;
    Can charge with hope, with zeal inspire,
    And kindle life, and light, and fire.

                                   VI

    Even as Thou saidst!--O Spirit, come,
    Make with Thy people here Thy home;
    In all their need Thy gifts supply,
    And Christ our Lord still glorify.




                                    I

    O may the Spirit of all grace
      Descend and in our hearts abide,
      And what of good or ill betide,
    Find in them aye a resting-place.

                                   II

    There is no peace to mortals given,
      Save when the Spirit finds His rest
      Within the secret of our breast,
    And there inspires the calm of heaven.

                                   III

    Our earthly calms a storm presage,
      They whisper peace, and tempests rise,
      And clouds obscure the brightest skies,
    And winds, and waves in tumult rage.

                                   IV

    No storm disturbs the heavenly peace,
      No whispering fills the soul with fears
      As when the brooding tempest nears,
    And clouds around our path increase.

                                    V

    'Tis lasting calm, 'tis heavenly rest;
      Come, Spirit of the Living God,
      And in our spirits shed abroad
    The peace that makes the troubled blest.




                                COMMUNION




                                    I

    Let Thy Blood in mercy poured,
      Let thy gracious Body broken,
    Be to me, O gracious Lord
      Of Thy boundless love the token;
    Thou didst give Thyself for me,
    Now I give myself to Thee.

                                   II

    Thou didst die that I might live;--
      Blessed Lord Thou cam'st to save me;
    All that love of God could give,
      Jesus by His sorrows gave me;--
    Thou didst give Thyself for me,
    Now I give myself to Thee.

                                   III

    By the thorns that crowned Thy brow,
      By the spear wound and the nailing;
    By the pain and death I now
      Claim, O Christ, Thy love unfailing;
    Thou didst give Thyself for me,
    Now I give myself to Thee.

                                   IV

    Wilt Thou own the gift I bring?
      All my penitence I give Thee;
    Thou art my exalted King,
      Of Thy matchless love forgive me;--
    Thou didst give Thyself for me,
    Now I give myself to Thee.




                                    I

    O Lord of bounty, let this bread
      Be Thy pure Body unto me;
    And let the wine in symbol poured,
      Tell of the glorious Mystery;--
    O let me here Thy presence feel;
    And all my sins in mercy heal.

                                   II

    I am not worthy to partake
      Of Thy pure Body, gracious Lord;
    Nor of the Blood so freely shed
      By Thee, O Thou Incarnate Word;
    Yet grant Thy presence unto me,
    And let me now commune with Thee.




                                JUDGMENT




                                    I

    When in the clouds the Lord appears,
      And angels stand around His throne;
    When judgment fills the soul with fears,
      And none can aught of sin disown;--
    Spare me, O Lord, Thy creature spare,
    And let my soul Thy mercy share.

                                   II

    Even in Thy judgment mercy shew;--
      But ere that awful day awakes,
    Make me my guilty state to know,
      And from my evil courses break;--
    Spare me, O Lord, Thy creature spare,
    And let my soul Thy mercy share.

                                   III

    For Thou art pitiful and kind,
      And Thou hast died, O Judge of men,
    That, ere the Judgment, I may find
      The path that leads to life again;--
    Spare me, O Lord, Thy creature spare,
    And let my soul Thy mercy share.

                                   IV

    I have no penitence nor tears,
      I have no merit of my own;
    But, ah! my soul is filled with fears,
      And gladly would its sin disown;--
    Spare me, O Lord, Thy creature spare,
    And let my soul Thy mercy share.

                                    V

    And bring me nigh the throne of grace,
      That, ere the day of Judgment dire,
    I may behold Thy loving face,
      And flee Thine all consuming ire;--
    Spare me, O Lord, Thy creature spare,
    And let my soul Thy mercy share.

                                   VI

    Swift draws the day of Judgment nigh;
      Wake, wake, my soul, the Judge is near!
    And call for mercy while thy cry
      Can enter His inclining ear;--
    Spare me, O Lord, Thy creature spare,
    And let my soul Thy mercy share.




                                    I

    The Bridegroom comes! My soul, awake,
    And slumber from thine eyelids shake;
    Hark! in the midnight hour the cry;
    Bestir, my soul, for He is nigh.

                                   II

    Now trim your lamp, and let its light
    Illume the darkness of the night;
    And with the tarrying host attend
    The Bridegroom, as the Bridegroom's friend.

                                   III

    Hast thou no oil? O foolish soul!
    Why didst thou not the hours control?
    Why in the darkness slumber still,
    Without the oil your lamp to fill?

                                   IV

    Go, get your oil,--but no, too late!
    The Bridegroom's come, and closed the gate;--
    "O let me knock, for He is kind,
    And will not leave my soul behind."

                                    V

    "O let me in, my lamp's aglow;
    How could I, Lord, Thy coming know?
    'Twas night, I slumbered,--let me in:
    Forgive, O Lord, forgive my sin."

                                   VI

    Too late! The time has gone apace;
    Too late, 'tis gone, the hour of grace;
    O soul of mine, awake, awake,
    And slumber from thine eyelids shake.




                                    I

    O Judge of all, when sinful men
      To Thy dire judgment seat are brought,--
    Tell not the error of my life,
                O tell it not.

                                   II

    When bowed with grief my tears are shed,
      Because my life with sin is fraught,
    To angel hosts tell not my sin,
                O tell it not.

                                   III

    O hide the secrets of my soul,
      And give the pardon I have sought,
    And to the myriads round Thy throne,
                O tell them not.

                                   IV

    O merciful and just Thou art;
      In pity view my woeful lot,
    And shame me not because of sin,--
                O tell it not.
