LITTLE FOLDED HANDS

Prayers for Children


Compiled from Various Sources


Revised Edition



Morning Prayers.


1.

  Now I awake and see the light;
  Lord, Thou hast kept me through the night.
  To Thee I lift my voice and pray
  That Thou wilt keep me through the day.
  If I should die before 'tis done,
  O God, accept me through Thy Son! Amen.


2.

  The morning bright
  With rosy light
  Has waked me from my sleep;
  Father, I own
  Thy love alone
  Thy little one doth keep.

  All through the day,
  I humbly pray,
  Be Thou my Guard and Guide;
  My sins forgive
  And let me live,
  Blest Jesus, near Thy side. Amen.


3.

  Now I raise me up from sleep,
  I thank the Lord who did me keep,
  All through the night; and to Him pray
  That He may keep me through the day.
  All which for Jesus' sake, I say. Amen.


4.

  O help me, Lord, this day to be
  Thy own dear child and follow Thee;
  And lead me, Savior, by Thy hand
  Until I reach the heavenly land. Amen.


5.

  O Lord, my God, to Thee pray
  While from my bed I rise
  That all I do and all I say
  Be pleasing to Thine eyes. Amen.


6.

  Jesus, Lord, to Thee I pray,
  Guide and guard me through this day.
  As the shepherd tends his sheep.
  Lord, me safe from evil keep.
  Keep my feet from every snare,
  Keep me with Thy watchful care.

  All my little wants supply
  If I live or if I die.
  And when life, O Lord, is past,
  Take me to Thyself at last. Amen.


7.

  In the early morning,
  With the sun's first rays.
  All God's little children
  Thank and pray and praise.

  I, too, thanks would offer,
  Jesus, Shepherd dear,
  For Thy tender pasture,
  For Thy guiding care.

  And I would implore Thee,
  Be with me this day,
  Lest I from Thee wander,
  Into danger stray. Amen.


8.

  For this new morning with its light,
  For rest and shelter of the night,
  For health and food, for love and friends.
  For everything Thy goodness sends,
  We thank Thee, dearest Lord. Amen.


9.

  I thank Thee, Lord, for sleep and rest,
  For all the things that I love best,
  Now guide me through another day
  And bless my work and bless my play.
  Lord, make me strong for noble ends,
  Protect and bless my loving friends;
  Of all mankind good Christians make.
  All this I ask for Jesus' sake. Amen.


10.

  Jesus, gentle Shepherd,
  Bless Thy lamb to-day;
  Keep me in Thy footsteps,
  Never let me stray.
  Guard me through the daytime.
  Every hour, I pray;
  Keep my feet from straying
  From the narrow way. Amen.
