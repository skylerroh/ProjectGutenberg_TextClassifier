PREFACE.


In presenting this work to the public, the compilers would say, that they
do not intend it as a rival of any other Hymn Book already in existence;
but, if advancement in the light of other good works be allowable, as an
improvement on them all. Although evidently designed in one sense for a
denomination, they have also intended that it shall answer in some
measure the demands of a liberal and progressive Christianity--a
Christianity, under whatever name or pretension found, that would diffuse
Christ's spirit and do his works of truth and love among men.

We have sought to give variety in these Hymns; to have the number ample
enough; and while cautious in reference to their literary character, to
select those of a devotional tendency, rather than those chiefly
commendable for their poetical excellence. We have intended also to pay
due respect to the old Hymns so justly familiar with those of every age
among our worshippers, while we have not been unmindful of the new
claimants of public favor.

It will be perceived that there is a greater variety of Hymns on several
topics than in most other Hymn Books now in use among us; especially in
reference to the philanthropic nature of our religion, and the peculiar
indications of this nature in the present age. In the department of the
book entitled "Triumph of Christianity," faithfulness in representing
this great truth is designed. In all instances where the authorship of a
hymn could be ascertained, it has been given. Of a few hymns, however,
taken from a copy of the new Cambridge Unitarian Hymn Book, kindly handed
us in sheets, it was not known whether they were original or not. They
appear in this book, therefore, in company with quite a number of
original ones, without any special mark thus to designate them.

To the friends who have so kindly aided us, by suggestions or
contributions, we return our sincere thanks; and to the Christian public
do we now humbly dedicate this work, invoking the blessing of God upon
its use, and praying that it may be welcomed by many souls seeking the
aids and blessings of Christian devotion.

Above, below, where'er I gaze,                                       116
According to thy gracious word,                                      690
Affliction is a stormy deep,                                         609
Again our ears have heard the voice,                                  83
Again our earthly cares we leave,                                     32
Again the Lord of life and light,                                     60
A glance from heaven with sweet effect,                              526
A glory gilds the sacred page,                                       186
A holy air is breathing round,                                       917
Ah! wretched souls who strive in vain,                               443
A King shall reign in righteousness,                                 255
All from the sun's uprise,                                           166
All hail the power of Jesus' name,                                   246
All hail, ye servants of the Lord,                                   770
All nature dies and lives again,                                     550
All nature feels attractive power,                                   381
All nature's works his praise declare,                               984
All men are equal in their birth,                                    766
All powerful, self-existent God,                                     146
All ye nations, praise the Lord,                                      94
Almighty former of creation's plan,                                  121
Almighty God, in humble prayer,                                      459
Almighty God, thy wondrous works,                                    139
Almighty King, whose wondrous hand,                                  515
Almighty Maker, Lord of all,                                         489
Almighty Lord, before thy throne,                                    874
Along my earthly way,                                                521
Amazing, beauteous change,                                           312
Am I an Israelite indeed,                                            502
Am I a soldier of the cross,                                         369
Amid surrounding gloom and waste,                                    994
Amidst a world of hopes and fears,                                   487
And art thou with us, gracious Lord,                                 627
And can my heart aspire so high,                                     481
And is the gospel peace and love,                                    357
And is there, Lord, a rest,                                          563
And now, my soul, another year,                                      895
Angels! roll the rock away,                                          235
Another day is past,                                                 950
Another six days' work is done,                                       58
Approach not the altar with gloom in thy soul,                       965
Approach, thou blessed of the Lord,                                  663
Around Bethesda's healing wave,                                      221
Arrayed in clouds of golden light,                                   210
As body when the soul has fled,                                      773
As bowed by sudden storms, the rose,                                 579
As earth's pageant passes by,                                        421
Asleep in Jesus, blessed sleep,                                      549
As in solemn congregation,                                           687
As o'er the past my memory strays,                                   893
A soldier's course, from battles won,                                340
As showers on meadows newly mown,                                    292
As the evening shadows gather,                                       716
As the hart with eager looks,                                        428
As the sweet flower that scents the morn,                            582
As twilight's gradual veil is spread,                                551
As when the deluge waves were gone,                                  968
At God's command the morning ray,                                    857
At the portals of thy house,                                          72
Auspicious morning, hail,                                            846
Author of good, to thee we turn,                                     430
A voice from the desert comes awful and shrill,                      199
Awake, my soul, and with the sun,                                    936
Awake, my soul, lift up thine eyes,                                  367
Awake, my soul, stretch every nerve,                                 368
Awake our souls, away our fears,                                     370
Baptized into our Saviour's death,                                   671
Before Jehovah's awful throne,                                         4
Begin, my soul, the exalted lay,                                     161
Begin the high celestial strain,                                     169
Behold, amid his little flock,                                       683
Behold my servant, see him rise,                                     198
Behold, on Zion's heavenly shore,                                    561
Behold th' amazing sight,                                            247
Behold the grace appears,                                            206
Behold the lofty sky,                                                188
Behold the morning sun,                                              280
Behold the path which mortals tread,                                 541
Behold the Prince of Peace,                                          216
Behold the Saviour on the cross,                                     231
Behold the western evening light,                                    544
Behold, what wondrous grace,                                         442
Behold where breathing love divine,                                  225
Behold where in a mortal form,                                       239
Be it my only wisdom here,                                           457
Beneath our feet and o'er our head,                                  531
Bereft, of all, when hopeless care,                                  633
Beset with snares on every hand,                                     455
Be thou, O God, exalted high,                                        149
Be with me, Lord, where'er I go,                                     488
Beyond, beyond that boundless sea,                                   108
Blessed be thy name forever,                                         170
Blessed state and happy he,                                          964
Bless, O bless, Almighty Father,                                     997
Bless, O Lord, each opening year,                                    894
Blest are the humble souls that see,                                 344
Blest are the meek, he said,                                         348
Blest are the pure in heart,                                         351
Blest are the sons of peace,                                         393
Blest are the souls that hear and know,                              276
Blest be the hour when friends shall meet,                           580
Blest be the tie that binds,                                         659
Blest day of God, most calm, most bright,                              8
Blest hour, when mortal man retires,                                  44
Blest instructor! from thy ways,                                     334

No warlike sounds awoke the night,                                   810
No war nor battle's sound,                                           806
Now, gracious Lord, thine arm reveal,                                892

Now to the Lord a noble song,                                        260
O bow thine ear, Eternal One,                                        698
O cease, my wandering soul,                                          474

O'er mountain tops the mount of God,                                 811
O'er the dark wave of Galilee,                                       219
O Father, draw us after thee,                                        612

One prayer I have, all prayers in one,                               499
One sweet flower has drooped and faded,                              761
On eyes that never saw the day,                                      218

On what has now been sown,                                            89
On Zion, his most holy mount,                                        290
On Zion's holy walls,                                                597

So fades the lovely blooming flower,                                 583
Soft are the fruitful showers that bring,                            336
Softly fades the twilight ray,                                        79
Softly now the light of day,                                         955
Soldier to the contest pressing,                                     992
So let our lips and lives express,                                   339
Sometimes a light surprises,                                         415
Soon as I heard my Father say,                                       622
Soon will our fleeting hours be past,                                 92
Sound the full chorus, let praises ascend,                           309
Sovereign of life, before thine eye,                                 530
Sovereign of worlds above,                                           715
Sow in the morn thy seed,                                            772
Spirit of grace, and help, and power,                                 77
Stand up and bless the Lord,                                           3
Still in shades of midnight darkness,                                313
Stretched on the cross the Saviour dies,                             232
Suppliant, lo! thy children bend,                                    748
Supreme and universal light,                                         429
Sweet day! so cool, so calm, so bright,                              962
Sweet is the bliss of souls serene,                                  414
Sweet is the friendly voice,                                         327
Sweet is the prayer whose holy stream,                               366
Sweet is the scene when virtue dies,                                 543
Sweet is the task, O Lord,                                            43
Sweet is the time of spring,                                         745
Sweet is the work, my God, my King,                                   61
Sweet to the soul the parting ray,                                   958
Swell the anthem, raise the song,                                    881
Talk with us, Lord, thyself reveal,                                  503
Teach me, my God and King,                                           406
Teach me, O teach me, Lord, thy way,                                 477
Teach us to feel as Jesus prayed,                                    251
The air of death breathes through our souls,                         603
The billows swell, the winds are high,                               832
The bird let loose in eastern skies,                                 451
The bird that soars on highest wing,                                 353
The Christian warrior, see him stand,                                362
The darkened sky, how thick it lowers,                               607
The day is past and gone,                                            951
The evils that beset our path,                                       527
The fountain in its source,                                          508
The glorious universe around,                                        394
The God of harvest praise,                                           876
The God of mercy will indulge,                                       595
The God who reigns alone,                                            137
The heavenly spheres to thee, O God,                                 177
The heaven of heavens cannot contain,                                118
The heavens declare his glory,                                       181
The heavens declare thy glory, Lord,                                 185
The heavens, O Lord, thy power proclaim,                             178
The hoary frost, the fleecy snow,                                    866
The hours of evening close,                                          957
The joyful morn, my God, is come,                                     62
The King of heaven his table spreads,                                277
The last full wain has come,--has come,                              879
The leaves around me falling,                                        865
The long lost son, with streaming eyes,                              324
The Lord descended from above,                                       144
The Lord is on his holy throne,                                     1005
The Lord Jehovah reigns,                                             113
The Lord my pasture shall prepare,                                   495
The Lord of glory is my light,                                       645
The Lord our God is clothed with might,                              105
The Lord will come and not be slow,                                  285
The man in life wherever placed,                                     413
The mellow eve is gliding,                                           944
The morning dawns upon the place,                                    227
The mourners came at break of day,                                   605
Theories which thousands cherish,                                   1002
The past is dark with sin and shame,                                 999
The perfect world by Adam trod,                                      697
The promises I sing,                                                 639
The radiant dawn of gospel light,                                    311
There is a God, all nature speaks,                                   101
There is a hope, a blessed hope,                                     380
There is a land mine eye hath seen,                                  564
There is a land of pure delight,                                     555
There is an hour of peaceful rest,                                   557
There is a pure and peaceful wave,                                   991
There is a time when moments flow,                                   960
There is a world we have not seen,                                   560
There's a refuge of peace from the tempests that beat,                25
There's not a star whose twinkling light,                            122
There's not a place in earth's vast round,                           147
There sprang a tree of deadly name,                                  796
There was joy in heaven,                                             333
The saints on earth and those above,                                 395
The Saviour gently calls,                                            669
The Saviour, what a noble flame,                                     223
These mortal joys, how soon they fade,                               525
The spacious firmament on high,                                      175
The spirit in our hearts,                                            275
The spirit moved upon the waves,                                     115
The spring, the joyous spring is come,                               862
The thing my God doth hate,                                          490
The triumphs of the martyred saints,                                 979
The turf shall be my fragrant shrine,                                183
The vineyard of the Lord,                                            722
The wandering star and fleeting wind,                                326
The year begins with promises,                                       858
They who seek the throne of grace,                                   365
Think gently of the erring,                                          813
This child we dedicate to thee,                                      567
This day let grateful praise ascend,                                  40
This day the Lord hath called his own,                                41
This is the fast the Lord doth choose,                               868
This is the first and great command,                                 385
This stone to thee in faith we lay,                                  696
Thou art, Almighty, Lord of all,                                     141
Thou art gone to the grave,                                          567
Thou art, O God, the life and light,                                 174
Thou art the way, and he who sighs,                                  243
Thou book of life, in thee are found,                                196
Thou fount of love and grace,                                        701
Thou gavest, and we yield to thee,                                   588
Thou faint and sick, and worn away,                                  971
Though lost to our sight, we may not deplore thee,                   758
Thou God of hope, to thee we bow,                                    782
Thou God of truth and love,                                          912
Thou, Lord, by mortal eyes unseen,                                   253
Thou, Lord, by strictest search hast known,                          140
Thou must go forth alone, my soul,                                   537
Thou power supreme, whose mighty scheme,                             635
Thou whose wide extended sway,                                       307
Thrice happy soul, who, born from heaven,                            342
Through all the changing scenes of life,                             617
Through endless years thou art the same,                             127
Through every age, Eternal God,                                      898
Through sorrow's night and danger's way,                             360
Through the day thy love has spared us,                              952
Through thee we now together come,                                   922
Thus far the Lord has led me on,                                     945
Thus saith the first, the great command,                             355
Thus saith the high and lofty One,                                   364
Thus saith the Lord who built the heavens,                           252
Thus shall thou love th' Almighty Lord,                              341
Th' uplifted eye and bended knee,                                    390
Thy kingdom, Lord, forever stands,                                   132
Thy life I read, my dearest Lord,                                    666
Thy name be hallowed, evermore,                                      100
Thy presence everlasting God,                                        923
Thy presence, gracious God, afford,                                   23
Thy ways, O Lord, with wise design,                                  148
Times without number have I prayed,                                  332
Time by moments steals away,                                         896
Time! what an empty vapor 'tis,                                      897
'Tis a point I long to know,                                         454
'Tis by the faith of joys to come,                                   374
'Tis done, the great transaction's done,                             674
'Tis finished, so the Saviour cried,                                 233
'Tis God the spirit leads,                                           510
'Tis good to weep and mourn for those,                               804
'Tis gone, that bright and orbed blaze,                              948
'Tis midnight, and on Olive's brow,                                  228
