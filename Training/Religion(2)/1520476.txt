      To thy human temples come.

2   Come, in this accepted hour;
      Bring thy heavenly kingdom in!
    Fill us with thy glorious power,
      Rooting out the seeds of sin:
    Nothing more can we require,
      We will covet nothing less;
    Be thou all our heart's desire,
      Be our heaven--in holiness.

"Thy Will be done."


1   Father, I know thy ways are just,
      Although to me unknown;
    O, grant me grace thy love to trust,
      And cry, "Thy will be done."

2   If thou shouldst hedge with thorns my path;
      Should wealth and friends be gone;
    Still with a firm and lively faith,
      I'll cry, "Thy will be done."

3   Although thy steps I cannot trace,
      Thy sovereign right I'll own;
    And, as instructed by thy grace;
      I'll cry, "Thy will be done."

4   'Tis sweet thus passively to lie
      Before thy gracious throne,
    Concerning everything to cry,
      "My Father's will be done."

Confidence in God.


1   My God! the covenant of thy love
      Abides forever sure;
    And in thy matchless grace I feel
      My happiness secure.

2   What though my house be not with thee
      As nature could desire?
    To nobler joys than nature gives
      Thy servants all aspire.

3   Since thou, the everlasting God,
      My Father art become;
    Jesus my Guardian and my Friend,
      And heaven my final home:

4   I welcome all thy sovereign will,
      For all that will is love;
    And when I know not what thou dost,
      I wait the light above.

5   Thy covenant the last accent claims
      Of this poor faltering tongue;
    And that shall the first notes employ
      Of my celestial song.

Prayer for Religious Principle.


1   Amidst a world of hopes and fears,
    A wild of cares, and toils, and tears,
    Where foes alarm and dangers threat,
    And pleasures kill, and glories cheat:

2   Shed down, O Lord! a heavenly ray,
    To guide me in the doubtful way;
    And o'er me hold thy shield of power,
    To guard me in the dangerous hour.

3   Teach me the flattering paths to shun,
    In which the thoughtless many run,
    Who for a shade the substance miss,
    And grasp their ruin in their bliss.

4   May never pleasure, wealth or pride,
    Allure my wandering soul aside;
    But through this maze of mortal ill,
    Safe lead me to thy heavenly hill.

Prayer for Divine Help.


1   Be with me, Lord, where'er I go;
    Teach me what thou wouldst have me do;
    Show me my weakness,--let me see
    I have my power, my all from thee.

2   Enrich me always with thy love;
    My kind protection ever prove;
    Thy signet put upon my breast,
    And let thy spirit on me rest.

3   Assist and teach me how to pray;
    Incline my nature to obey;
    What thou abhorr'st that let me flee,
    And only love what pleases thee.

4   O may I never do my will,
    But thine, and only thine, fulfil;
    Let all my time and all my ways
    Be spent and ended to thy praise.

Prayer for the Christian Temper.


1   Almighty Maker! Lord of all!
      Of life the only spring!
    Creator of unnumbered worlds!
      Supreme, Eternal King!

2   Drive from the confines of my heart
      Impenitence and pride;
    Nor let me, in forbidden paths,
      With thoughtless sinners glide.

3   Let not despair nor fell revenge
      Be to my bosom known:
    Oh! give me tears for others' woes,
      And patience for my own.

4   Feed me with necessary food;
      I ask not wealth or fame;
    Give me an eye to see thy will,
      A heart to bless thy name.

5   May still my days serenely pass,
      Without remorse or care;
    And growing holiness my soul
      For life's last hour prepare.

For Holiness.


1     The thing my God doth hate
      That I no more may do,
    Thy creature, Lord, again create,
      And all my soul renew;
      Abhor the thing unclean,
    And, sanctified by love divine,
      Forever cease from sin.

2     That blessed law of thine,
      Father, to me impart;
    The Spirit's law of life divine,
      O write it in my heart!
      Implant it deep within,
      Whence it may ne'er remove,
    The law of liberty from sin,
      The perfect law of love.

3     Thy nature be my law,
      Thy spotless sanctity,
    And sweetly every moment draw
      My happy soul to thee.
      Soul of my soul remain!
      Who didst for all fulfil,
    In me, O Lord, fulfil again
      My heavenly Father's will.

1   Father of me and all mankind,
      And all the hosts above,
    Let every understanding mind
      Unite to praise thy love.

2   Thy kingdom come, with power and grace
      To every heart of man;
    Thy peace, and joy, and righteousness,
      In all our bosoms reign.

3   The righteousness that never ends,
      But makes an end of sin;
    The joy that human thought transcends,
      Into our souls bring in.

4   The kingdom of established peace,
      Which can no more remove;
    The perfect powers of godliness,
      Th' omnipotence of love.

Seeking God.


1     My God, permit my tongue
      This joy, to call thee mine;
    And let my early cries prevail
      To taste thy love divine.

2     My thirsty, fainting soul
      Thy mercy does implore;
    Not travellers in desert lands
      Can pant for water more.

3     For life, without thy love,
      No relish can afford;
    No joy can be compared to this,
      To serve and please the Lord.

4     Since thou hast been my help,
      To thee my spirit flies,
    And on thy watchful providence
      My cheerful hope relies.

1   O God! thou art my God alone;
      Early to thee my soul shall cry,
    A pilgrim in a land unknown,
      A thirsty land, whose springs are dry.

2   Yet through this rough and thorny maze,
      I follow hard on thee, my God;
    Thine hand unseen upholds my ways;
      I lean upon thy staff and rod.

3   Thee, in the watches of the night,
      When I remember on my bed,
    Thy presence makes the darkness light;
      Thy guardian wings are round my head.

4   Better than life itself thy love,
      Dearer than all beside to me;
    For whom have I in heaven above,
      Or what on earth, compared with thee?

The Knowledge of God.


1   Shine forth, Eternal Source of light!
      And make thy glories known;
    Fill our enlarged, adoring sight
      With lustre all thine own.

2   Vain are the charms, and faint the rays
      The brightest creatures boast;
    And all their grandeur and their praise
      Is in thy presence lost.

3   To know the Author of our frame
      Is our sublimest skill;
    True science is to read thy name,
      True life to obey thy will.

4   For this I long, for this I pray,
      And following on pursue,
    Till visions of eternal day
      Fix and complete the view.

God our Shepherd.


1   The Lord my pasture shall prepare,
    And feed me with a shepherd's care;
    His presence shall my wants supply,
    And guard me with a watchful eye;
    My noonday walks he shall attend,
    And all my midnight hours defend.

2   When in the sultry glebe I faint,
    Or on the thirsty mountains pant,
    To fertile vales and dewy meads
    My weary, wandering steps he leads,
    Where peaceful rivers, soft and slow,
    Amid the verdant landscape flow.

3   Though in the paths of death I tread,
    With gloomy horrors overspread,
    My steadfast heart shall fear no ill,
    For thou, O Lord, art with me still.
    Thy friendly staff shall give me aid,
    And guide me through the dreadful shade.

4   Though, in a bare and rugged way,
    Through devious, lonely wilds I stray,
    Thy bounty shall my pains beguile,--
    The barren wilderness shall smile,
    With sudden greens and herbage crowned
    And streams shall murmur all around.

1     God, who is just and kind,
      Will those who err instruct,
    And to the paths of righteousness
      Their wandering steps conduct.

2     The humble soul he guides,
      Teaches the meek his way,
    Kindness and truth he shows to all
      Who his just laws obey.

3     Give me the tender heart
      That mixes fear with love,
    And lead me through whatever path
      Thy wisdom shall approve.

4     Oh! ever keep my soul
      From error, shame and guilt;
    Nor suffer the fair hope to fail,
      Which on thy truth is built.

Clinging to God.


1   O Lord, thy heavenly grace impart,
    And fix my frail, inconstant heart:
    Henceforth my chief desire shall be
    To dedicate myself to thee.

2   Whate'er pursuits my time employ,
    One thought shall fill my soul with joy:
    That silent, secret thought shall be,
    That all my hopes are fixed on thee.

3   Thy glorious eye pervadeth space;
    Thy presence, Lord, fills every place;
    And wheresoe'er my lot may be,
    Still shall my spirit cleave to thee.

4   Renouncing every earthly thing,
    And safe beneath thy spreading wing,
    My sweetest thought henceforth shall be,
    That all I want I find in thee.

God our Refuge and Hope.


1   God, my supporter and my hope,
      My help forever near;
    Thine arm of mercy held me up,
      When sinking in despair.

2   Thy counsels, Lord, shall guide my feet
      Through this dark wilderness;
    Thine hand conduct me near thy seat,
      To dwell before thy face.

3   What if the springs of life were broke,
      And flesh and heart should faint?
    God is my soul's eternal rock,
      The strength of every saint.

4   Behold the sinners, that remove
      Far from thy presence, die;
    Not all the idol gods they love
      Can save them when they cry.

5   But to draw near to thee, my God,
      Shall be my sweet employ;
    My tongue shall sound thy works abroad,
      And tell the world my joy.

1   One prayer I have,--all prayers in one,--

    "Thy will, my God, thy will be done,
      And let that will be mine."

2   All-wise, almighty, and all-good,
      In thee I firmly trust;
    Thy ways, unknown or understood,
      Are merciful and just.

3   May I remember that to thee
      Whate'er I have I owe;
    And back in gratitude from me
      May all thy bounties flow.

4   Thy gifts are only then enjoyed,
      When used as talents lent;
    Those talents only well employed,
      When in thy service spent.

5   And though thy wisdom takes away,
      Shall I arraign thy will?
    No, let me bless thy name, and say,
      "The Lord is gracious still."

The Soul Returning to God.


1   Return, my soul, unto thy rest,
      From vain pursuits and maddening cares,
    From lonely woes that wring thy breast,
      The world's allurements, toils and snares.

2   Return unto thy rest, my soul,
      From all the wanderings of thy thought;
    From sickness unto death made whole;
      Safe through a thousand perils brought.

3   Then to thy rest, my soul return,
      From passions every hour at strife;
    Sin's works, and ways, and wages spurn,
      Lay hold upon eternal life.

4   God is thy rest;--with heart inclined
      To keep his word, that word believe;
    Christ is thy rest;--with lowly mind,
      His light and easy yoke receive.

Invocation of the Divine Spirit.


1   Come, holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
      With all thy quickening powers,
    Kindle a flame of sacred love
      In these cold hearts of ours.

2   In vain we tune our formal songs,
      In vain we strive to rise;
    Hosannas languish on our tongues,
      And our devotion dies.

3   Dear Lord! and shall we ever live
      At this poor dying rate?
    Our love so faint, so cold to thee,
      And thine to us so great?

4   Come, holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
      With all thy quickening powers,
    Come, shed abroad a Saviour's love,
      And that shall kindle ours.

1   Am I an Israelite indeed.
      Without a false disguise?
    Have I renounced my sins, and left

2   Say, does my heart unchanged remain,
      Or is it formed anew?
    What is the rule by which I walk,
      The object I pursue?

3   Cause me, O God of truth and grace,
      My real state to know;
    If I am wrong, O set me right!
      If right, preserve me so!

2   With thee conversing, we forget
      All time, and toil, and care;
    Labor is rest, and pain is sweet,
      If thou, my God, art here.

3   Here, then, my God, vouchsafe to stay,
      And bid my heart rejoice;
    My bounding heart shall own thy sway,
      And echo to thy voice.

    Ashamed of thee, whom angels praise,

2   Ashamed of Jesus! just as soon
    Let midnight be ashamed of noon;
    'Tis midnight with my soul, till he,
    Bright morning star, bid darkness flee.

3   Ashamed of Jesus! yes I may,
    When I've no guilt to wash away,
    No tear to wipe--no good to crave,
    No fears to quell--no soul to save.

4   Till then--nor is my boasting vain--
    Till then, I boast a Saviour slain;
    And oh! may this my glory be,
    That Christ is not ashamed of me.

2   Of my boasted wisdom spoiled,
    Docile, helpless as a child;
    Only seeing in thy light,
    Only walking in thy might.

3   Then infuse the living grace,

2   What thou shalt to-day provide,
      Let me as a child receive;
    What to-morrow may betide,
      Calmly to thy wisdom leave:
    'Tis enough that thou wilt care;
    Why should I the burden bear?

3   As a little child relies
      On a care beyond his own;
    Knows he's neither strong nor wise
      Fears to stir a step alone;
    Let me thus with thee abide,
    As my Father, Guard, and Guide.

    Say, dost thou love thy children less?
      No! ever-gracious Father, no!

3   No distance can outreach thine eye,

    Be this my comfort when I sigh,
      Be this my safeguard when I stray.

Foretaste of Heaven.


1   What must it be to dwell above,
      At God's right hand, where Jesus reigns,
    Since the sweet earnest of his love
      O'erwhelms us on these earthly plains!
    No heart can think, no tongue explain,

      When sorrow pains our hearts no more,
    How shall we view the Prince of Light
      And all his works of grace explore!
    What heights and depths of love divine
    Will there through endless ages shine!

3   This is the heaven I long to know;
      For this, with patience, I would wait,
    Till, weaned from earth, and all below,
      I mount to my celestial seat,
    And wave my palm, and wear my crown,
    And, with the elders, cast them down.

2   Whate'er my noblest powers can wish
      In thee doth richly meet;
    No light unto my eyes so dear,
      No friendship half so sweet.

3   Thy grace shall dwell upon my heart,
      And shed its fragrance there,--
    The noblest balm of all its wounds,
      The cordial of its care.

4   I'll speak the honors of thy name
      With my expiring breath,
    And, dying, clasp thee in my arms,
      The antidote of death.

The Hope of Heaven.


1   When I can read my title clear
      To mansions in the skies,
    I bid farewell to every fear,
      And wipe my weeping eyes.

2   Let cares like a wild deluge come,
      And storms of sorrow fall,
    May I but safely reach my home,
      My God, my heaven, my all!

3   There shall I bathe my weary soul
      In seas of heavenly rest,
    And not a wave of trouble roll
      Across my peaceful breast.




LIFE, DEATH AND FUTURITY.

"From everlasting to everlasting, thou art God."


1   Our God, our help in ages past,
      Our hope for years to come,
    Our shelter from the stormy blast,
      And our eternal home;

2   Before the hills in order stood,
      Or earth received her frame,
    From everlasting thou art God,
      To endless years the same.

3   A thousand ages, in thy sight,
      Are like an evening gone;
    Short as the watch that ends the night,
      Before the rising sun.

4   Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
      Bears all its sons away;
    They fly forgotten, as  a dream
      Dies at the opening day.




515.              L. M.                    Cowper.

The Providence of Life.


1   Almighty King! whose wondrous hand
    Supports the weight of sea and land,
    Whose grace is such a boundless store,
    No heart shall break that sighs for more!

2   Thy providence supplies my food,
    And 'tis thy blessing makes it good:
    My soul is nourished by thy word;
    Let soul and body praise the Lord.

3   My streams of outward comfort came
    From him who built this earthly frame;
    Whate'er I want his bounty gives,
    By whom my soul forever lives.

4   Either his hand preserves from pain,
    Or, if I feel it, heals again;
    From strife and sorrow shields my breast,
    Or overrules them for the best.

The Pilgrimage of Life.


1   Lead us with thy gentle sway,
      As a willing child is led;
    Speed us on our forward way,
      As a pilgrim, Lord, is sped,
    Who with prayers and helps divine
    Seeks a consecrated shrine.

2   We are pilgrims, and our goal
      Is that distant land whose bourn
    Is the haven of the soul;
      Where the mourners cease to mourn,
    Where the Saviour's hand will dry
    Every tear from every eye.

3   Lead us thither! thou dost know
      All the way; but wanderers we
    Often miss our path below,
      And stretch out our hands to thee;
    Guide us,--save us,--and prepare
    Our appointed mansion there!




517.              C. M.                Montgomery.

"Looking for another country, that is an heavenly."


1   While through this changing world we roam,
      From infancy to age,
    Heaven is the Christian pilgrim's home,
      His rest at every stage.

2   Thither his raptured thought ascends,
      Eternal joys to share;
    There his adoring spirit bends,
      While here he kneels in prayer.

3   Oh! there may we our treasure place,
      There let our hearts be found;
    That still, where sin abounded, grace
      May more and more abound.

4   Henceforth our conversation be
      With Christ before the throne;
    Ere long, we eye to eye shall see,
      And know as we are known.




518.              L. M.                 Doddridge.

Redeeming the Time.


1   God of eternity! from thee
      Did infant time its being draw;
    Moments and days, and months, and years,
      Revolve by thine unvaried law.

2   Silent and swift they glide away;
      Steady and strong the current flows,
    Lost in eternity's wide sea,
      The boundless gulf from whence it rose.

3   With it the thoughtless sons of men
      Before the rapid stream are borne
    On to their everlasting home,
      Whence not one soul can e'er return.

4   Great Source of wisdom! teach our hearts
      To know the price of every hour,
    That time may bear us on to joys
      Beyond its measure and its power.

What is your Life?


1   O, what is life?--'tis like a flower
      That blossoms and is gone;
    It flourishes its little hour,
      With all its beauty on:
    Death comes, and, like a wintry day,
    It cuts the lovely flower away.

2   O, what is life?--'tis like the bow
      That glistens in the sky:
    We love to see its colors glow;
      But, while we look, they die:
    Life fails as soon:--to-day 'tis here;
    To-morrow it may disappear.

3   Lord, what is life?--if spent with thee
      In humble praise and prayer,
    How long or short our life may be,
      We feel no anxious care:
    Though life depart, our joys shall last
    When life and all its joys are past.




520.              L. M.                   Bowring.

Our Times are in thy Hand.


1   Our times are in thy hand, and thou
      Wilt guide our footsteps at thy will:
    Lord, to thy purposes we bow,
      Do thou thy purposes fulfil!

2   Life's mighty waters roll along,
      Thy spirit guides them as they roll;
    And waves on waves impetuous throng
      At thy command, at thy control.

3   Lord, we, thy children, look to thee,
      And with an humble, prostrate will,
    Find in thine all-sufficiency
      A claim to love and serve thee still.

"Why sayest thou--my way is hid from the Lord?"


1     Along my earthly way,
      How many clouds are spread!
    Darkness, with scarce one cheerful ray,
      Seems gathering o'er my head.

2     Yet, Father, thou art love:
      O hide not from my view!
    But when I look, in prayer, above,
      Appear in mercy through!

3     My pathway is not hid;
      Thou knowest all my need;
    And I would do as Israel did,--
      Follow where thou wilt lead.

4     Lead me, and then my feet
