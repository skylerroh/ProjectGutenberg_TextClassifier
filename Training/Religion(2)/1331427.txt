
The Principle of these marvellous works is divine; but
the actor was human. This divine Principle is discerned
in Christian Science, as we advance in the spiritual under- [25]
standing that all substance, Life, and intelligence are
God. The so-called miracles contained in Holy Writ are
neither supernatural nor preternatural; for God is good,
and goodness is more natural than evil. The marvellous
healing-power of goodness is the outflowing life of Chris- [30]
tianity, and it characterized and dated the Christian era.

[Page 200.]

It was the consummate naturalness of Truth in the [1]
mind of Jesus, that made his healing easy and instan-
taneous. Jesus regarded good as the normal state of man,
and evil as the abnormal; holiness, life, and health as
the better representatives of God than sin, disease, and [5]
death. The master Metaphysician understood omnipo-
tence to be All-power: because Spirit was to him All-
in-all, matter was palpably an error of premise and
conclusion, while God was the only substance, Life,
and intelligence of man. [10]

The apostle Paul insists on the rare rule in Christian
Science that we have chosen for a text; a rule that is sus-
ceptible of proof, and is applicable to every stage and
state of human existence. The divine Science of this rule
is quite as remote from the general comprehension of man- [15]
kind as are the so-called miracles of our Master, and for
the sole reason that it is their basis. The foundational
facts of Christian Science are gathered from the supremacy
of spiritual law and its antagonism to every supposed ma-
terial law. Christians to-day should be able to say, with [20]
the sweet sincerity of the apostle, "I take pleasure in
infirmities,"--I enjoy the touch of weakness, pain, and
all suffering of the flesh, _because_ it compels me to seek the
remedy for it, and to find happiness, apart from the per-
sonal senses. The holy calm of Paul's well-tried hope [25]
met no obstacle or circumstances paramount to the tri-
umph of a reasonable faith in the omnipotence of good,
involved in its divine Principle, God: the so-called pains
and pleasures of matter were alike unreal to Jesus; for he
regarded matter as only a vagary of mortal belief, and sub- [30]
dued it with this understanding.

The abstract statement that all is Mind, supports the

[Page 201.]

entire wisdom of the text; and this statement receives [1]
the mortal scoff only because it meets the immortal de-
mands of Truth. The Science of Paul's declaration re-
solves the element misnamed matter into its original sin,
or human will; that will which would oppose bringing the [5]
qualities of Spirit into subjection to Spirit. Sin brought
death; and death is an element of matter, or material
falsity, never of Spirit.

When Jesus reproduced his body after its burial, he
revealed the myth or material falsity of evil; its power- [10]
lessness to destroy good, and the omnipotence of the
Mind that knows this: he also showed forth the error
and nothingness of supposed life in matter, and the great
somethingness of the good we possess, which is of Spirit,
and immortal. [15]

Understanding this, Paul took pleasure in infirmities,
for it enabled him to triumph over them,--he declared
that "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath
made me free from the law of sin and death;" he took
pleasure in "reproaches" and "persecutions," because [20]
they were so many proofs that he had wrought the prob-
lem of being beyond the common apprehension of sinners;
he took pleasure in "necessities," for they tested and de-
veloped latent power.

We protect our dwellings more securely after a robbery, [25]
and our jewels have been stolen; so, after losing those
jewels of character,--temperance, virtue, and truth,--
the young man is awakened to bar his door against further
robberies.

Go to the bedside of pain, and there you can demon- [30]
strate the triumph of good that has pleasure in infirmities;
because it illustrates through the flesh the divine power

[Page 202.]

of Spirit, and reaches the basis of all supposed miracles; [1]
whereby the sweet harmonies of Christian Science are
found to correct the discords of sense, and to lift man's
being into the sunlight of Soul.


    "The chamber where the good man meets his fate [5]
    Is privileged beyond the walks of common life,
      Quite on the verge of heaven."





CHAPTER VII. POND AND PURPOSE.


[Page 203.]

Beloved Students:--In thanking you for your [1]
gift of the pretty pond contributed to Pleasant View,
in Concord, New Hampshire, I make no distinction be-
tween my students and your students; for here, thine
becomes mine through gratitude and affection. [5]

From my tower window, as I look on this smile of
Christian Science, this gift from my students and their
students, it will always mirror their love, loyalty, and
good works. Solomon saith, "As in water face answereth
to face, so the heart of man to man." [10]

The waters that run among the valleys, and that
you have coaxed in their course to call on me, have
served the imagination for centuries. Theology religiously
bathes in water, medicine applies it physically, hydrology
handles it with so-called science, and metaphysics appro- [15]
priates it topically as type and shadow. Metaphysically,
baptism serves to rebuke the senses and illustrate Christian
Science.

_First:_ The baptism of repentance is indeed a stricken
state of human consciousness, wherein mortals gain [20]
severe views of themselves; a state of mind which rends
the veil that hides mental deformity. Tears flood the eyes,

[Page 204.]

agony struggles, pride rebels, and a mortal seems a [1]
monster, a dark, impenetrable cloud of error; and falling
on the bended knee of prayer, humble before God, he
cries, "Save, or I perish." Thus Truth, searching the
heart, neutralizes and destroys error. [5]

This mental period is sometimes chronic, but oftener
acute. It is attended throughout with doubt, hope, sorrow,
joy, defeat, and triumph. When the good fight is fought,
error yields up its weapons and kisses the feet of Love,
while white-winged peace sings to the heart a song of [10]
angels.

_Second:_ The baptism of the Holy Ghost is the spirit
of Truth cleansing from all sin; giving mortals new
motives, new purposes, new affections, all pointing up-
ward. This mental condition settles into strength, free- [15]
dom, deep-toned faith in God; and a marked loss of faith
in evil, in human wisdom, human policy, ways, and means.
It develops individual capacity, increases the intellectual
activities, and so quickens moral sensibility that the
great demands of spiritual sense are recognized, and they [20]
rebuke the material senses, holding sway over human
consciousness.

By purifying human thought, this state of mind per-
meates with increased harmony all the minutiae of human
affairs. It brings with it wonderful foresight, wisdom, [25]
and power; it unselfs the mortal purpose, gives steadi-
ness to resolve, and success to endeavor. Through the
accession of spirituality, God, the divine Principle of
Christian Science, literally governs the aims, ambition,
and acts of the Scientist. The divine ruling gives prudence [30]
and energy; it banishes forever all envy, rivalry,
evil thinking, evil speaking and acting; and mortal

[Page 205.]

mind, thus purged, obtains peace and power outside of [1]
itself.

This practical Christian Science is the divine Mind,
the incorporeal Truth and Love, shining through the mists
of materiality and melting away the shadows called sin, [5]
disease, and death.

In mortal experience, the fire of repentance first sepa-
rates the dross from the gold, and reformation brings
the light which dispels darkness. Thus the operation
of the spirit of Truth and Love on the human thought, [10]
in the words of St. John, "shall take of mine and show it
unto you."

_Third:_ The baptism of Spirit, or final immersion of
human consciousness in the infinite ocean of Love, is the
last scene in corporeal sense. This omnipotent act drops [15]
the curtain on material man and mortality. After this,
man's identity or consciousness reflects only Spirit, good,
whose visible being is invisible to the physical senses: eye
hath not seen it, inasmuch as it is the disembodied in-
dividual Spirit-substance and consciousness termed in [20]
Christian metaphysics the ideal man--forever permeated
with eternal life, holiness, heaven. This order of Science
is the chain of ages, which maintain their obvious corre-
spondence, and unites all periods in the divine design.
Mortal man's repentance and absolute abandonment of [25]
sin finally dissolves all supposed material life or physical
sensation, and the corporeal or mortal man disappears
forever. The encumbering mortal molecules, called man,
vanish as a dream; but man born of the great Forever,
lives on, God-crowned and blest. [30]

Mortals who on the shores of time learn Christian
Science, and live what they learn, take rapid transit to

[Page 206.]

heaven,--the hinge on which have turned all revolu- [1]
tions, natural, civil, or religious, the former being servant
to the latter,--from flux to permanence, from foul to
pure, from torpid to serene, from extremes to intermediate.
Above the waves of Jordan, dashing against the receding [5]
shore, is heard the Father and Mother's welcome, saying
forever to the baptized of Spirit: "This is my beloved
Son." What but divine Science can interpret man's
eternal existence, God's allness, and the scientific inde-
structibility of the universe? [10]

The advancing stages of Christian Science are gained
through growth, not accretion; idleness is the foe of
progress. And scientific growth manifests no weakness,
no emasculation, no illusive vision, no dreamy absentness,
no insubordination to the laws that be, no loss nor lack [15]
of what constitutes true manhood.

Growth is governed by intelligence; by the active,
all-wise, law-creating, law-disciplining, law-abiding Prin-
ciple, God. The real Christian Scientist is constantly
accentuating harmony in word and deed, mentally and [20]
orally, perpetually repeating this diapason of heaven:
"Good is my God, and my God is good. Love is my God,
and my God is Love."

Beloved students, you have entered the path. Press
patiently on; God is good, and good is the reward of all [25]
who diligently seek God. Your growth will be rapid, if
you love good supremely, and understand and obey the
Way-shower, who, going before you, has scaled the steep
ascent of Christian Science, stands upon the mount of
holiness, the dwelling-place of our God, and bathes in the [30]
baptismal font of eternal Love.

As you journey, and betimes sigh for rest "beside the

[Page 207.]

still waters," ponder this lesson of love. Learn its pur- [1]
pose;and in hope and faith, where heart meets heart
reciprocally blest, drink with me the living waters of the
spirit of my life-purpose,--to impress humanity with
the genuine recognition of practical, operative Christian [5]
Science.





CHAPTER VIII. PRECEPT UPON PRECEPT


[Page 208.]




"Thy Will Be Done"


This is the law of Truth to error, "Thou shalt surely
die." This law is a divine energy. Mortals cannot
prevent the fulfilment of this law; it covers all sin and
its effects. God is All, and by virtue of this nature and [5]
allness He is cognizant only of good. Like a legislative
bill that governs millions of mortals whom the legislators
know not, the universal law of God has no knowledge
of evil, and enters unconsciously the human heart and
governs it. [10]

Mortals have only to submit to the law of God, come
into sympathy with it, and to let His will be done. This
unbroken motion of the law of divine Love gives, to the
weary and heavy-laden, rest. But who is willing to do
His will or to let it be done? Mortals obey their own [15]
wills, and so disobey the divine order.

All states and stages of human error are met and
mastered by divine Truth's negativing error in the way
of God's appointing. Those "whom the Lord loveth He
chasteneth." His rod brings to view His love, and inter- [20]
prets to mortals the gospel of healing. David said, "Be-
fore I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I
kept Thy word." He who knows the end from the be-

[Page 209.]

ginning, attaches to sin due penalties as its antidotes and [1]
remedies.

Who art thou, vain mortal, that usurpest the preroga-
tive of divine wisdom, and wouldst teach God not to punish
sin? that wouldst shut the mouth of His prophets, [5]
and cry, "Peace, peace; when there is no peace,"--yea,
that healest the wounds of my people slightly?

The Principle of divine Science being Love, the divine
rule of this Principle demonstrates Love, and proves that
human belief fulfils the law of belief, and dies of its own [10]
physics. Metaphysics also demonstrates this Principle of
cure when sin is self-destroyed. Short-sighted physics
admits the so-called pains of matter that destroy its more
dangerous pleasures.

Insomnia compels mortals to learn that neither obliv- [15]
ion nor dreams can recuperate the life of man, whose
Life is God, for God neither slumbers nor sleeps. The
loss of gustatory enjoyment and the ills of indigestion
tend to rebuke appetite and destroy the peace of a false
sense. False pleasure will be, is, chastened; it has no [20]
right to be at peace. To suffer for having "other gods
before me," is divinely wise. Evil passions die in their
own flames, but are punished before extinguished. Peace
has no foothold on the false basis that evil should be
concealed and that life and happiness should still attend [25]
it. Joy is self-sustained; goodness and blessedness are
one: suffering is self-inflicted, and good is the master of
evil.

To this scientific logic and the logic of events, egotism
and false charity say, " 'Not so, Lord;' it is wise to [30]
cover iniquity and punish it not, then shall mortals have
peace." Divine Love, as unconscious as incapable of

[Page 210.]

error, pursues the evil that hideth itself, strips off its [1]
disguises, and--behold the result: evil, uncovered, is
self-destroyed.

Christian Science never healed a patient without prov-
ing with mathematical certainty that error, when found [5]
out, is two-thirds destroyed, and the remaining third
kills itself. Do men whine over a nest of serpents, and
post around it placards warning people not to stir up
these reptiles because they have stings? Christ said,
"They shall take up serpents;" and, "Be ye therefore [10]
wise as serpents and harmless as doves." The wisdom
of a serpent is to hide itself. The wisdom of God, as
revealed in Christian Science, brings the serpent out of
its hole, handles it, and takes away its sting. Good deeds
are harmless. He who has faith in woman's special adapt- [15]
ability to lead on Christian Science, will not be shocked
when she puts her foot on the head of the serpent, as it
biteth at the heel.

Intemperance begets a belief of disordered brains,
membranes, stomach, and nerves; and this belief serves [20]
to uncover and kill this lurking serpent, intemperance,
that hides itself under the false pretense of human need,
innocent enjoyment, and a medical prescription. The
belief in venereal diseases tears the black mask from the
shameless brow of licentiousness, torments its victim, and [25]
thus may save him from his destroyer.

Charity has the courage of conviction; it may suffer
long, but has neither the cowardice nor the foolhardiness
to cover iniquity. Charity is Love; and Love opens
the eyes of the blind, rebukes error, and casts it out. [30]
Charity never flees before error, lest it should suffer
from an encounter. Love your enemies, or you will not

[Page 211.]

lose them; and if you love them, you will help to reform [1]
them.

Christ points the way of salvation. His mode is not
cowardly, uncharitable, nor unwise, but it teaches mor-
tals to handle serpents and cast out evil. Our own vision [5]
must be clear to open the eyes of others, else the blind
will lead the blind and both shall fall. The sickly charity
that supplies criminals with bouquets has been dealt
with summarily by the good judgment of people in
the old Bay State. Inhuman medical bills, class legisla- [10]
tion, and Salem witchcraft, are not indigenous to her
soil.

"Out of the depths have I delivered thee." The
drowning man just rescued from the merciless wave is
unconscious of suffering. Why, then, do you break his [15]
peace and cause him to suffer in coming to life? Because
you wish to save him from death. Then, if a criminal
is at peace, is he not to be pitied and brought back to
life? Or, are you afraid to do this lest he suffer, trample
on your pearls of thought, and turn on you and rend you? [20]
Cowardice is selfishness. When one protects himself at
his neighbor's cost, let him remember, "Whosoever will
save his life shall lose it." He risks nothing who obeys
the law of God, and shall find the Life that cannot be
lost. [25]

Our Master said, "Ye shall drink indeed of my cup."
Jesus stormed sin in its citadels and kept peace with
God. He drank this cup giving thanks, and he said to
his followers, "Drink ye all of it,"--drink it all, and let
all drink of it. He lived the spirit of his prayer,--"Thy [30]
kingdom come." Shall we repeat our Lord's Prayer
when the heart denies it, refuses to bear the cross and

[Page 212.]

to fulfil the conditions of our petition? Human policy [1]
is a fool that saith in his heart, "No God"--a caressing
Judas that betrays you, and commits suicide. This god-
less policy never knows what happiness is, and how it is
obtained. [5]

Jesus did his work, and left his glorious career for our
example. On the shore of Gennesaret he tersely re-
minded his students of their worldly policy. They had
suffered, and seen their error. This experience caused
them to remember the reiterated warning of their Mas- [10]
ter and cast their nets on the right side. When they
were fit to be blest, they received the blessing. The
ultimatum of their human sense of ways and means
ought to silence ours. One step away from the direct
line of divine Science cost them--what? A speedy re- [15]
turn under the reign of difficulties, darkness, and unre-
quited toil.

The currents of human nature rush in against the right
course; health, happiness, and life flow not into one of
their channels. The law of Love saith, "Not my will, [20]
but Thine, be done," and Christian Science proves that
human will is lost in the divine; and Love, the white
Christ, is the remunerator.

If, consciously or unconsciously, one is at work in a
wrong direction, who will step forward and open his [25]
eyes to see this error? He who _is_ a Christian Scientist,
who has cast the beam out of his own eye, speaks plainly
to the offender and tries to show his errors to him before
letting another know it.

Pitying friends took down from the cross the fainting [30]
form of Jesus, and buried it out of their sight. His dis-
ciples, who had not yet drunk of his cup, lost sight of

[Page 213.]

him; they could not behold his immortal being in the [1]
form of Godlikeness.

All that I have written, taught, or lived, that is good,
flowed through cross-bearing, self-forgetfulness, and my
faith in the right. Suffering or Science, or both, in the [5]
proportion that their instructions are assimilated, will
point the way, shorten the process, and consummate the
joys of acquiescence in the methods of divine Love. The
Scripture saith, "He that covereth his sins shall not pros-
per." No risk is so stupendous as to neglect opportuni- [10]
ties which God giveth, and not to forewarn and forearm
our fellow-mortals against the evil which, if seen, can
be destroyed.

May my friends and my enemies so profit by these
waymarks, that what has chastened and illumined [15]
another's way may perfect their own lives by gentle
benedictions. In every age, the pioneer reformer must
pass through a baptism of fire. But the faithful adher-
ents of Truth have gone on rejoicing. Christian Science
gives a fearless wing and firm foundation. These are [20]
its inspiring tones from the lips of our Master, "My
sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow
me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall
never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of
my hand." He is but "an hireling" who fleeth when he [25]
seeth the wolf coming.

Loyal Christian Scientists, be of good cheer: the night
is far spent, the day dawns; God's universal kingdom
will appear, Love will reign in every heart, and _His_ will
be done on earth as in heaven. [30]

[Page 214.]




"Put Up Thy Sword"


While Jesus' life was full of Love, and a demonstra-
tion of Love, it appeared hate to the carnal mind, or
mortal thought, of his time. He said, "Think not that
I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send [5]
peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at
variance against his father, and the daughter against her
mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-
law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own house-
hold." [10]

This action of Jesus was stimulated by the same Love
that closed--to the senses--that wondrous life, and
that summed up its demonstration in the command,
"Put up thy sword." The very conflict his Truth brought,
in accomplishing its purpose of Love, meant, all [15]
the way through, "Put up thy sword;" but the sword
must have been drawn before it could be returned into
the scabbard.

My students need to search the Scriptures and "Science
and Health with Key to the Scriptures," to understand [20]
the personal Jesus' labor in the flesh for their salvation:
they need to do this even to understand my works, their
motives, aims, and tendency.

The attitude of mortal mind in being healed morally,
is the same as its attitude physically. The Christian [25]
Scientist cannot heal the sick, and take error along with
Truth, either in the recognition or approbation of it.
This would prevent the possibility of destroying the
tares: they must be separated from the wheat before
they can be burned, and Jesus foretold the harvest hour [30]

[Page 215.]

and the final destruction of error through this very pro- [1]
cess,--the sifting and the fire. The tendency of mortal
mind is to go from one extreme to another: Truth comes
into the intermediate space, saying, "I wound to heal;
I punish to reform; I do it all in love; my peace I leave [5]
with thee: not as the world giveth, give I unto thee.
Arise, let us go hence; let us depart from the material
sense of God's ways and means, and gain a spiritual
understanding of them."

But let us not seek to climb up some other way, as we [10]
shall do if we take the end for the beginning or start
from wrong motives. Christian Science demands order
and truth. To abide by these we must first understand
the Principle and object of our work, and be clear that
it is Love, peace, and good will toward men. Then we [15]
shall demonstrate the Principle in the way of His ap-
pointment, and not according to the infantile concep-
tion of our way; as when a child in sleep walks on the
summit of the roof of the house because he is a som-
nambulist, and thinks he is where he is not, and would [20]
fall immediately if he knew where he was and what he
was doing.

My students are at the beginning of their demonstra-
tion; they have a long warfare with error in themselves
and in others to finish, and they must at this stage use [25]
the sword of Spirit.

They cannot in the beginning take the attitude, nor
adopt the words, that Jesus used at the _end_ of his
demonstration.

If you would follow in his footsteps, you must not try [30]
to gather the harvest while the corn is in the blade, nor
yet when it is in the ear; a wise spiritual discernment

[Page 216.]

must be used in your application of his words and infer- [1]
ence from his acts, to guide your own state of combat
with error. There _remaineth_, it is true, a Sabbath rest
for the people of God; but we must first have done our
work, and entered into our rest, as the Scriptures give [5]
example.




Scientific Theism


In the May number of our _Journal_, there appeared a
review of, and some extracts from, "Scientific Theism,"
by Phare Pleigh. [10]

Now, Phare Pleigh evidently means more than "hands
off." A live lexicographer, given to the Anglo-Saxon
tongue, might add to the above definition the "laying
on of hands," as well. Whatever his _nom de plume_
means, an acquaintance with the author justifies one [15]
in the conclusion that he is a power in criticism, a
big protest against injustice; but, the best may be
mistaken.

One of these extracts is the story of the Cheshire Cat,
which "vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end [20]
of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained
some time after the rest of it had gone." Was this a witty
or a happy hit at idealism, to illustrate the author's fol-
lowing point?--

"When philosophy becomes fairy-land, in which neither [25]
laws of nature nor the laws of reason hold good, the
attempt of phenomenism to conceive the universe as a
_phenomenon without a noumenon_ may succeed, but not
before; for it is an attempt to conceive a grin without
a cat." [30]

[Page 217.]

True idealism is a divine Science, which combines in [1]
logical sequence, nature, reason, and revelation. An
effect without a cause is inconceivable; neither philoso-
phy nor reason attempts to find one; but all should con-
