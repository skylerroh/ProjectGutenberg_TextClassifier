      "Welcome, pilgrim, to thy rest."
    Now within the gate rejoice,
      Safe, and owned, and bought and blest--
    Safe--from all the lures of vice,
      Owned--by joys the contrite know,
    Bought--by love and life the price,
      Blest--the mighty debt to owe!

3   Holy pilgrim! what for thee,
      In a world like this, remains?
    From thy guarded breast shall flee
      Fear, and shame, and doubt and pains--
    Fear--the hope of heaven shall fly,
      Shame--from glory's view retire,
    Doubt--in full belief shall die,
      Pain--in endless bliss expire.

1   Bright was the guiding star that led,
      With mild benignant ray,
    The Gentiles to the lowly shed
      Where the Redeemer lay.

2   But lo! a brighter, clearer light
      Now points to his abode
    It shines through sin and sorrow's night
      To guide us to our Lord.

3   O haste to follow where it leads;
      The gracious call obey,
    Be rugged wilds, or flowery meads,
      The Christian's destined way.

4   O gladly tread the narrow path
      While light and grace are given;
    We'll meekly follow Christ on earth,
      And reign with him in heaven.

      Were kindled by his grace.

      He hears thy humble sigh;
    He sees thy softened spirit mourn,
      When no one else is nigh.

3   Return, O wanderer, now return;
      Thy Father bids thee live;
    Go to his feet, and grateful learn
      How freely he'll forgive.

    Thy Father calls--no longer mourn;

      Her day of luxury stored,
    She o'er her Saviour's hallowed feet
      The precious ointment poured;

      That shame, those weeping eyes,
    And the sunk heart which inly bled,
      Heaven's noblest sacrifice?

      O wouldst thou wake to heaven,
    Like Mary kneel, like Mary weep;
      "Love much," and be forgiven!

    Watch to see the morning rise;

4   Ye, by fiercer anguish torn,
    In remorse for guilt who mourn,
    Here repose your heavy care:

2   The dews and rains, in all their store,

    Are not so copious as that grace
    Which sanctifies and saves our race.

    So, in the secrecy of love,
    Falls the sweet influence from above.

    In holy silence of the mind,
    While every grace maintains its bloom,
    Diffusing wide its rich perfume.

    To me, but poured on all mankind,
    Till earth's wild wastes in verdure rise,
    And a young Eden bless our eyes.

      Pours inexhaustible supplies,
    Whence sagest teachers may be taught,
      And Wisdom's self become more wise.

3   More glorious still as centuries roll,
      New regions blest, new powers unfurled,
    Expanding with the expanding soul,
      Its waters shall o'erflow the world;

4   Flow to restore, but not destroy;
      As when the cloudless lamp of day
    Pours out its floods of light and joy,
      And sweeps each lingering mist away.

Universal Reign of Christ.


1   Great God, whose universal sway
    The known and unknown worlds obey;
    Now give the kingdom to thy Son;
    Extend his power, exalt his throne.

2   The heathen lands, that lie beneath
    The shades of overspreading death,
    Revive at his first dawning light,
    And deserts blossom at the sight.

3   The saints shall flourish in his days,
    Dressed in the robes of joy and praise;
    Peace, like a river, from his throne
    Shall flow to nations yet unknown.

Predicted Glory of the Messiah's Kingdom.


1   Rise, crowned with light, imperial Salem, rise!
    Exalt thy towering head, and lift thine eyes!
    See heaven its sparkling portals wide display,
    And break upon thee in a flood of day!

2   See a long race thy spacious courts adorn,
    See future sons and daughters yet unborn,
    In crowding ranks on every side arise,
    Demanding life, impatient for the skies!

3   See barbarous nations at thy gates attend,
    Walk in thy light, and in thy temples bend!
    See thy bright altars thronged with prostrate kings,
    While every land its joyous tribute brings.

4   The seas shall waste, the skies to smoke decay,
    Rocks fall to dust, and mountains melt away
    But fixed his word, his saving power remains,
    Thy realm shall last, thy own Messiah reigns.

Encouraging Prospects.


1   Yes, we trust the day is breaking;
      Joyful times are near at hand;
    God, the mighty God, is speaking,
      By his word, in every land:
        When he chooses,
      Darkness flies at his command.

2   While the foe becomes more daring,
      While he enters like a flood,
    God, the Saviour, is preparing
      Means to spread his truth abroad:
        Every language
      Soon shall tell the love of God.

3   God of Jacob, high and glorious,
      Let thy people see thy hand;
    Let the gospel be victorious,
      Through the world, in every land;
        Then shall idols
      Perish, Lord, at thy command.

Universal Hallelujah.


1   When shall the voice of singing
      Flow joyfully along?
    When hill and valley, ringing
      With one triumphant song,
    Proclaim the contest ended,
      And Him, who once was slain,
    Again to earth descended,
      In righteousness to reign?

2   Then from the craggy mountains
      The sacred shout shall fly,
    And shady vales and fountains
      Shall echo the reply:
    High tower and lowly dwelling
      Shall send the chorus round,
    The hallelujah swelling
      In one eternal sound.

Prospect of Universal Blessedness.


1   Lo! what a glorious sight appears
      To our believing eyes!
    The earth and seas are passed away,
      And the old rolling skies.

2   From the third heaven, where God resides
      That holy, happy place,
    The new Jerusalem comes down,
      Adorned with shining grace.

3   "The God of glory down to men
      Removes his blessed abode;
    Men, the dear objects of his grace,
      And he, the loving God.

4   "His own soft hand shall wipe the tears
      From every weeping eye;
    And pains and groans, and griefs and fears,
      And death itself shall die."

5   How long, dear Saviour, O how long
      Shall this bright hour delay?
    Fly swifter round, ye wheels of time,
      And bring the welcome day.

The Cloud and Pillar of Fire.


1   Long as the darkening cloud abode,
      So long did ancient Israel rest;
    Nor moved they, till the guiding Lord
      In brighter garments stood confest.

2   Father of spirits, Light of light,
      Lift up the cloud, and rend the veil;
    Shine forth in fire, amid that night,
      Whose blackness makes the heart to fail.

3   'T is done! to Christ the power is given;
      His death has rent the veil away,
    Our great Forerunner entered heaven,
      And oped the gate of endless day.

4   Nor shall those mists that brood o'er time,
      Forever blind the mental eye;
    They backward roll, and light sublime
      Beams glory from our God on high.

5   Adoring nations hail the dawn,
      All kingdoms bless the noontide beam,
    And light, unfolding life's full morn,
      Is vast creation's deathless theme.

The Kingdom of God.


1   Come, kingdom of our God,
      Sweet reign of light and love!
    Shed peace, and hope, and joy abroad,
      And wisdom from above.

2   Over our spirits first
      Extend thy healing reign;
    There raise and quench the sacred thirst,
      That never pains again.

3   Come, kingdom of our God!
      And make the broad earth thine,
    Stretch o'er her lands and isles the rod
      That flowers with grace divine.

4   Soon may all tribes be blest
      With fruit from life's glad tree;
    And in its shade like brothers rest
      Sons of one family.

5   Come, kingdom of our God!
      And raise thy glorious throne
    In worlds by the undying trod,
      Where God shall bless his own.

The Kingdom of Christ.


1   Pour, blessed Gospel, glorious news for man!
      Thy stream of life o'er springless deserts roll:
    Thy bond of peace the mighty earth can span,
      And make one brotherhood from pole to pole.

2   On, piercing Gospel, on! of every heart,
      In every latitude, thou own'st the key:
    From their dull slumbers savage souls shall start,
      With all their treasures first unlocked by thee!

3   Tread, kingly Gospel, through the nations tread!
      With all the civil virtues in thy train:
    Be all to thy blest freedom captive led;
      And Christ, the true emancipator, reign!

4   Spread, giant Gospel, spread thy growing wings!
      Gather thy scattered ones from every land:
    Call home the wanderers to the King of kings;
      Proclaim them all thine own;--'t is Christ's command!

Christ's Triumph.


1   Hark! the song of jubilee,
      Loud as mighty thunders roar,
    Or the fulness of the sea,
      When it breaks upon the shore;--
    Hallelujah to the Lord!
      God omnipotent shall reign;
