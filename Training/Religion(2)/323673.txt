O bleeding Head, so wounded,
Reviled and put to scorn!
Death's pallid hue come o'er Thee
The glow of life decays,
Yet angel hosts adore Thee,
And tremble as they gaze.

2.
I see Thy strength and vigor
All fading in the strife,
And death, with cruel rigor,
Bereaving Thee of life;
O agony and dying!
O love to sinners free!
Jesus, all grace supplying,
O turn Thy face on me!

3.
In this Thy bitter passion,
Good Shepherd, think of me,
With Thy most sweet compassion,
Unworthy though I be;
Beneath Thy Cross abiding,
Forever would I rest,
In Thy dear love confiding,
And with Thy presence blest.

LENT AND PASSIONTIDE

At the Cross her station keeping
Stabat Mater

Jacopone da Todi. XIV Cent.
Traditional Melody from the Maintzesch Gesangbuch 1661
Harmonized by N. A. M.

Not too slow

1.
At the Cross her station keeping,
Stood the mournful Mother weeping,
Close to Jesus to the last.

2.
Through her heart, His sorrow sharing,
All His bitter anguish bearing,
Now at length the sword has passed.

3.
O that blessed one, grief laden,
Blessed Mother, Blessed Maiden,
Mother of the All-blest one.

4.
How she stood in desolation
Upward gazing on the passion
Of that deathless dying Son.

5.
Who could see, from tears refraining,
Christ's dear Mother uncomplaining
In so great a sorrow bowed?

6.
Who, unmoved, beheld her languish
Underneath His Cross of anguish,
'Mid the fierce unpitying crowd?

7.
For His people's sin th'All Holy
She beheld, the victim lowly,
Bleed in torments, bleed and die.

8.
Saw her well-beloved taken,
Saw her Child in death forsaken,
Heard his last expiring cry.

9.
Fount of love and sacred sorrow,
Mother! May my spirit borrow
Sadness from thy holy woe.

10.
May my spirit burn within me,
Love my God, and great love win me
Grace to please Him here below.


11.
Those five Wounds on Jesus smitten,
Mother, in my heart be written,
Deep as in thine own they be.

12.
Thou, my Savior's Cross who bearest,
Thou, Thy Son's rebuke who sharest,
Let me share them both with thee.

13.
In the Passion of my Maker
Be my sinful soul partaker,
Weep till death, and weep with thee.

14.
Mine with thee be that sad station,
There to watch the great Salvation,
Wrought upon th'atoning Tree.

15.
Virgin, thou of virgins fairest,
May the bitter woe thou sharest
Make on me impression deep.

16.
Thus Christ's dying may I carry,
With Him in His passion tarry,
And His wounds in mem'ry keep.

17.
May His wounds transfix me wholly,
May His Cross and Life Blood holy
Embriate my heart and mind.

18.
Thus inflamed with pure affection,
In the Virgin's Son protection
May I at the judgment find.

19.
When in death my limbs are failing,
Let Thy Mother's pray'r prevailing
Lift me, Jesus, to Thy throne.

20.
To my parting soul be given
Entrance through the gate of Heaven,
There confess me for Thine own.

Amen

LENT AND PASSIONTIDE

I see my Jesus crucified

Nicola A. Montani

Devoto

1.
I see my Jesus crucified,
His wounded Hands and Feet and Side,
His sacred Flesh all rent and torn,
His bloody crown of sharpest thorn.

2.
Those cruel nails, I drove them in,
Each time I pierced Him with my sin
That crown of thorns 'twas I who wove,
When I despised His gracious love.

3.
Then to those Feet I'll venture near,
And wash them with a contrite tear,
And ev'ry bleeding wound I see,
I'll think He bore them all for me.

4.
Deep graven on my sinful heart,
Oh, never may that form depart,
That with me always may abide
The thought of Jesus crucified.

O'erwhelmed in depths of woe
Saevo dolorum turbine

Tr. Rev. E. Caswall
Nicola A. Montani

Moderato

1.
O'erwhelmed in depths of woe,
Upon the Tree of scorn
Hangs the Redeemer of mankind,
With racking anguish torn.

2.
See! How the nails those Hands
And Feet so tender rend;
See! Down His Face, and Neck, and Breast,
His sacred Blood descend.

3.
Hark! With what awful cry,
His Spirit takes its flight;
That cry, it smote His Mother's heart
And wrapt her soul in night.

4.
Come, fall before His Cross,
Who shed for us His blood;
Who dies, the victim of pure love,
To make us Sons of God.

5.
Jesu! All praise to Thee,
Our joy and endless rest;
Be Thou our Guide while pilgrims here,
Our Crown amid the blest.

1.
All glory, laud, and honor
To Thee Redeemer, King,
To Whom the lips of children
Made sweet hosannas ring.

Refrain
All glory, laud, and honor,
To Thee Redeemer, King,
To Whom the lips of children
Made sweet hosannas ring.

2.
Thou art the King of Israel,
Thou David's royal Son,
Who in the Lord's name comest
The King and blessed One.

3.
The company of angels
Are praising Thee on high,
And mortal men and all things
Created make reply.

4.
The people of the Hebrews
With palms before them went;
To praise and pray'r and anthems
Before Thee we present.

5.
To Thee before Thy Passion
They sang their hymn of praise;
To Thee now high exalted
Our melody we raise.

6.
Thou didst accept their praises,
Accept the pray'rs we bring,
Who in all good delightest,
Thou good and gracious King.

"Ye Sons and daughters of the Lord" (No. 1)
O Filii et Filiae
Processional

Jean Tisserand (1494)
Tr. Rev. E. Caswall
Traditional Melody from
"Airs sur les Hymnes sacres, Odes et Noels," (Paris 1623)


Maestoso

Alleluia!  Alleluia!  Alleluia!

1.
Ye sons and daughters of the Lord!
The King of glory, King adored,
This day Himself from death restored. Alleluia!
Alleluia!  Alleluia!  Alleluia!

2.
All in the early morning grey
Went holy women on their way,
To see the tomb where Jesus lay. Alleluia!
Alleluia!  Alleluia!  Alleluia!

3.
Of spices pure a precious store
In their pure hands those women bore,
To anoint the Sacred Body o'er. Alleluia!
Alleluia!  Alleluia!  Alleluia!

4.
Then straightway One in white they see,
Who saith, "Ye seek the Lord; but He
Is ris'n, and gone to Galilee." Alleluia!
Alleluia!  Alleluia!  Alleluia!

5.
This told they Peter, told they John,
Who forthwith to the tomb are gone;
But Peter is by John outrun. Alleluia!
Alleluia!  Alleluia!  Alleluia!

6.
That selfsame night, while out of fear
The doors were shut, their Lord most dear
To His Apostles did appear. Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

7.
But Thomas when of this He heard,
Was doubtful of his brethren's word;
Wherefore again there comes the Lord. Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

8.
"Thomas, behold My Side" saith He;
"My Hands, My Feet, My Body see,
And doubt not, but believe in Me." Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

9.
When Thomas saw that wounded Side,
The truth no longer he denied;
"Thou art my Lord and God," he cried. Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

10.
Oh, blest are they who have not seen
Their Lord, and yet believe in Him:
Eternal life awaiteth them. Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

11.
Now let us praise the Lord most high,
And strive His Name to magnify
On this great day through earth and sky: Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

12.
Whose mercy ever runneth o'er,
Whom men and Angel Hosts adore,
To Him be glory ever more. Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

EASTERTIDE

Now at the Lamb's royal feast
Ad regias Agni dapes

Tr. Rev. E. Caswall
Nicola. A. Montani


Allegro moderato

1.
Now at the Lamb's royal feast,
In robes of saintly white, we sing,
Thro' the Red Sea in safety brought
By Jesus our immortal King.
O depth of love! For us He drains
The chalice of His agony;
For us a Victim on the Cross
He meekly lays Him down to die.

2.
And as th'avenging Angel pass'd
Of old the blood be-sprinkled door;
As the cleft sea a passage gave,
Then closed to whelm th'Egyptians o're;
So Christ, our Paschal Sacrifice,
Has brought us safe all perils thro',
While for unleavened bread He asks,
But heart sincere and purpose true.

3.
Hail, purest Victim Heav'n could find
The pow'rs of Hell to overthrow!
Who didst the bonds of Death unbind
Who dost the prize of Life bestow.
Hail, victor Christ! Hail, risen King!
To Thee alone belongs the crown;
Who has at the heav'nly gates unbarred,
And cast the Prince of darkness down.

4.
O Jesus! From the death of sin
Keep us, we pray; so shalt Thou be
The everlasting Paschal joy
Of all the souls newborn in Thee;
To God the Father, with the Son
