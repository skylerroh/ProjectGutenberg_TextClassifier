           The Hawaiian drama could lay hold of no worthier theme than
           that offered by the story of Pele. In this epic we find the
           natural and the supernatural, the everyday events of nature
           and the sublime phenomena of nature's wonderland, so
           interwoven as to make a story rich in strong human and deific
           coloring. It is true that the genius of the Hawaiian was not
           equal to the task of assembling the dissevered parts and of
           combining into artistic unity the materials his own
           imagination had spun. This very fact, however, brings us so
           much nearer to the inner workshop of the Hawaiian mind.

           The story of Pele is so long and complicated that only a
           brief abstract of it can be offered now:

           Pele, the goddess of the volcano, in her dreams and
           wanderings in spirit-form, met and loved the handsome Prince
           Lohiau. She would not be satisfied with mere spiritual
           intercourse; she demanded the sacrament of bodily presence.
           Who should be the ambassador to bring the youth from his
           distant home on Kauai? She begged her grown-up sisters to
           attempt the task. They foresaw the peril and declined the
           thankless undertaking. Hiiaka, the youngest and most
           affectionate, accepted the mission; but, knowing her
           sister's evil temper, strove to obtain from Pele a guaranty
           that her own forests and the life of her bosom friend Hopoe
           should be safeguarded during her absence.

           Hiiaka was accompanied by Wahine-oma'o--the woman in green--a
           woman as beautiful as herself. After many adventures they
           arrived at Haena and found Lohiau dead and in his sepulchre,
           a sacrifice to the jealousy of Pele. They entered the cave,
           and after ten days of prayer and incantation Hiiaka had the
           satisfaction of seeing the body of Lohiau warmed and animated
           by the reentrance of the spirit; and the company, now of
           three, soon started on the return to Kilauea.

           The time consumed by Hiiaka in her going and doing and
           returning had been so long that Pele was moved to
           unreasonable jealousy and, regardless of her promise to her
           faithful sister, she devastated with fire the forest parks of
           Hiiaka and sacrificed the life of Hiiaka's bosom friend, the
           innocent and beautiful Hopoe.

           Hiiaka and Lohiau, on their arrival at Kilauea, seated
           themselves on its ferny brink, and there, in the open view of
           Pele's court, Hiiaka, in resentment at the broken faith of
           her sister and in defiance of her power, invited and received
[Page 187] from Lohiau the kisses and dalliance which up to that time
           she had repelled. Pele, in a frenzy of passion, overwhelmed
           her errant lover, Lohiau, with fire, turned his body into a
           pillar of rock, and convulsed earth and sea. Only through the
           intervention of the benevolent peacemaking god Kane was the
           order of the world saved from utter ruin.

           The ancient Hawaiians naturally regarded the Pele hula with
           special reverence by reason of its mythological importance,
           and they selected it for performance on occasions of gravity
           as a means of honoring the kings and alii of the land. They
           would have considered its presentation on common occasions,
           or in a spirit of levity, as a great impropriety.

           In ancient times the performance of the hula Pele, like that
           of all other plays, was prefaced with prayer and sacrifice.
           The offering customarily used in the service of this hula
           consisted of salt crystals and of luau made from the delicate
           unrolled taro leaf. This was the gift demanded of every pupil
           seeking admission to the school of the hula, being looked
           upon as an offering specially acceptable to Pele, the patron
           of this hula. In the performance of the sacrifice teacher and
           pupil approached and stood reverently before the kuahu while
           the former recited a mele, which was a prayer to the goddess.
           The pupil ate the luau, the teacher placed the package of
           salt on the altar, and the service was complete.

           Both olapa and hoopaa took part in the performance of this
           hula. There was little or no moving about, but the olapa did
           at times sink down to a kneeling position. The performance
           was without instrumental accompaniment, but with abundant
           appropriate gestures. The subjects treated of were of such
           dignity and interest as to require no extraneous
           embellishment.

           Perusal of the mele which follows will show that the story of
           Pele dated back of her arrival in this group:


           _He Oli-O ka mele mua keia o ka, hula Pele_

                Mai Kahiki ka wahine, o Pele,
                Mai ka aina i Pola-pola,
                Mai ka punohu ula a Kane,
                Mai ke ao lalapa i ka lani,
            5   Mai ka opua lapa i Kahiki.

                Lapa-ku i Hawaii ka wahine, o Pele;
                Kalai i ka wa'a Houna-i-a-kea,
                Kou wa'a, e Ka-moho-alii.

[Page 188] 15   Noho a'e o Malau.

                Ia wai ka hope, ka uli o ka wa'a, e ne hoa 'lii?
                Ia Pele-honua-mea.
                A'ea'e kai hoe oluna o ka wa'a.

           20   O Ku ma, laua o Lono,
                Noho i ka honua aina,
                Kau aku i hoolewa moku.
                Hiiaka, noiau, he akua,
                Ku ae, hele a noho i ka hale o Pele.

           25   Huahua'i Kahiki, lapa uila, e Pele.
                E hua'i, e!

                         [Translation]

           _A Song--The first song of the hula Pele_

                From Kahiki came the woman, Pele,
                From the land of Pola-pola,
                From the red cloud of Kane,
                Cloud blazing in the heavens,
            5   Fiery cloud-pile in Kahiki.

                Eager desire for Hawaii seized the woman, Pele;
                She carved the canoe, Honna-i-a-kea,
                Your canoe, O Ka-moho-alii.
                They push the work on the craft to completion.
           10   The lashings of the god's canoe are done,
                The canoe of Kane, the world-maker.

                The tides swirl, Pele-honua-mea o'ermounts them;
                The god rides the waves, sails about the island;
                The host of little gods ride the billows;
           15   Malau takes his seat;
                One bales out the bilge of the craft.
                Who shall sit astern, be steersman, O, princes?
                Pele of the yellow earth.
                The splash of the paddles dashes o'er the canoe.

           20   Ku and his fellow, Lono,
                Disembark on solid land;
                They alight on a shoal.
                Hiiaka, the wise one, a god,
                Stands up, goes to stay at the house of Pele.

           25   Lo, an eruption in Kahiki!
                A flashing of lightning, O Pele!
                Belch forth, O Pele!

           Tradition has it that Pele was expelled from Kahiki by her
           brothers because of insubordination, disobedience, and
           disrespect to their mother, _Honua-mea_, sacred land. (If
           Pele in Kahiki conducted herself as she has done in Hawaii,
           rending and scorching the bosom of mother
           earth--Honua-Mea--it is not to be wondered that her brothers
           were anxious to get rid of her.) She voyaged north. Her
[Page 189] first stop was at the little island of Ka-ula, belonging to
           the Hawaiian group. She tunneled into the earth, but the
           ocean poured in and put a stop to her work. She had the same
           experience on Lehua, on Kiihau, and on the large island of
           Kauai. She then moved on to Oahu, hoping for better results;
           but though she tried both sides of the island, first mount
           Ka-ala--the fragrant--and then Konahuanui, she still found
           the conditions unsatisfactory. She passed on to Molokai,
           thence to Lanai, and to West Maui, and East Maui, at which
           last place she dug the immense pit of Hale-a-ka-la; but
           everywhere she was unsuccessful. Still journeying east and
           south, she crossed the wide Ale-nui-haha channel and came to
           Hawaii, and, after exploring in all directions, she was
           satisfied to make her home at Kilauea. Here is (_ka piko o ka
           honua_) the navel of the earth. Apropos of this effort of
           Pele to make a fire-pit for herself, see the song for the
           hula kuolo (p. 86), "A pit lies (far) to the east."

                    To Kauai, lifted in ether,
                    A floating flower at sea off Wailua--
                    That way Pele turns her gaze,
                    She's bidding adieu to Oahu,
                5   Loved land of new wine of the palm.       5
                    There comes a perfumed waft--mokihana--
                    The bath of the maid Hiiaka.
                    Scene it was once of Pele's contention,
                    Put by for future attention.
               10   Her foot now spurns the long-backed wave;       10
                    The phosphor burns like Pele's eye,
                    Or a meteor-flash in the sky.

           [Footnote 332: _Olewa_. Said to be the name of a wooded region
           high up on the mountain of Kauai. It is here treated as if it
           meant the heavens or the blue ether. Its origin is the same
           with the word _lewa_, the upper regions of the air.]

           [Footnote 333: _O Ahu_. In this instance the article still
           finds itself disunited from its substantive. To-day we have
           _Oahu_ and _Ola'a_.]

           growing season.]
[Page 190]
           The incidents and allusions in this mele belong to the story
           of Pele's journey in search of Lohiau, the lover she met in
           her dreams, and describe her as about to take flight from
           Oahu to Kauai (verse 4).

           Hiiaka's bath, _Wai auau o Hiiaka_ (verse 7), which was the
           subject of Pele's contention (verse 8), was a spring of water
           which Pele had planted at Huleia on her arrival from Kahiki.
           The ones with whom Pele had the contention were
           Kukui-lau-manienie and Kukui-lauhanahana, the daughters of
           Lima-loa, the god of the mirage. These two women lived at
           Huleia near the spring. Kamapua'a, the swinegod, their
           accepted lover, had taken the liberty to remove the spring
           from the rocky bed where Pele had planted it to a neighboring
           hill. Pele was offended and demanded of the two women:

           "Where is my spring of water?"

           "Where, indeed, is your spring? You belong to Hawaii. What
           have you to do with any spring on Kauai?" was their answer.

           "I planted a clean spring here on this rock," said Pele.

           "You have no water here," they insisted; "your springs are on
           Hawaii."

           "If I were not going in search of my husband Lohiau," said
           Pele, "I would set that spring back again in its old place."

           "You haven't the power to do that," said they. "The son of
           Kahiki-ula (Kama-puaa) moved it over there, and you can't
           undo his action."

           The eye of Pele, _He onohi no Pele_ (verse 11), is the
           phosphorescence which Pele's footfall stirs to activity in
           the ocean.

           The formal ending of this mele, _Elieli, kau mai_, is often
           found at the close of a mele in the hula Pele, and marks it
           as to all intents and purposes a prayer.

           _E waiho aku ana, o Ahu_ (verse 4). This is an instance of
           the separation of the article _o_ from the substantive _Ahu_,
           to which it becomes joined to form the proper name of the
           island now called Oahu.

           [Footnote 335: The figure in the second and third verses, of
           waves from Kahiki (_nalu mai Kahiki_) beating against the
           front of Kilauea (_Po-po'i aku la i ke alo o Kilauea_), seems
           to picture the trampling of the multitude splashing the mire
           as if it were, waves of ocean.]

           [Footnote 336: _Kukuena_. There is some uncertainty as to who
           this character was; probably the same as Haumea, the mother
           of Pele.]

                They bear the god's ax up the mountain;
                Trampling the mire, like waves from Kahiki
                That beat on the front of Kilauea.
                The people with offerings lift up a prayer;
            5   A woman strings wreaths in Olaa--
                Lehua grove mine bord'ring He-eia.
                And now Kukuena, mother god,
                Covers her loins with a pa-u of ti leaf;
                She mounts the altar; she sits.
           10   Behold us, your conclave of priests.
                Enter in, possess us!

           This has the marks of a Hawaiian prayer, and as such it is
           said to have been used in old times by canoe-builders when
           going up into the mountains in search of timber. Or it may
           have been recited by the priests and people who went up to
           fell the lehua tree from which to carve the Makahiki[337] idol;
           or, again, may it possibly have been recited by the company
           of hula folk who climbed the mountain in search of a tree to
           be set up in the halau as a representation of the god whom
           they wished to honor? This is a question the author can not
           settle. That it was used by hula folk is indisputable, but
           that would not preclude its use for other purposes.

                    At Wailua stands the main house-post;
                    This oracle harks to wild voices,
                    Tumult and clamor, O Ulu-po;
                    It utters no voice to entreaty.
                5   Alas for the prophet that's dumb!
                    But there drifts the incense of hala.
                    Mana sees the rain-whirl of Eleao.
                    The robe of Ka-u sways in the wind,
                    That dashes the waves 'gainst the sea-wall,
               10   At Honu-apo, windy Ka-u;
                    The Pai-ha'a palms strive with the gale.
                    Such weather is grievous to you:
                    The sea-scud is flying.
                    My little i-ao, O fly
               15   With the breeze Koolau!
                    Fly with the Moa'e-ku!
                    Look at the rain-mist fly!
                    Leap with the cataract, leap!
                    Plunge, now here, now there!
               20   Feet foremost, head foremost;
                    Leap with a glance and a glide!
                    Kauna, opens the dance; you win.
                    Rise, Hiiaka, arise!

           The meaning of this mele centers about a phenomenon that is
           said to have been observed at Ka-ipu-ha'a, near Wailua, on
           Kauai. To one standing on a knoll near the two cliffs Ikuwa
           and Mahoena (verse 5) there came, it is said, an echo from
           the murmur and clamor of the ocean and the moan of the wind,
           a confused mingling of nature's voices. The listener,
           however, got no echoing answer to his own call.

           The mele does not stick to the unities as we understand them.
           The poets of old Hawaii felt at liberty to run to the ends of
           their earth; and the auditor must allow his imagination to be
           transported suddenly from one island to another; in this
[Page 193] case, first from Wailua to Mana on the same island, where he
           is shown the procession of whirling rain clouds of Eleao
           (verse 7). Thence the poet carries him to Honuapo, Hawaii,
           and shows him the waves dashing against the ocean-walls and
           the clashing of the palm-fronds of Paiaha'a in the wind.

           The scene shifts back to Kauai, and one stands with the poet
           looking down on a piece of ocean where the people are wont to
           disport themselves. (Maka-iwa, not far from Ka-ipu-ha'a, is
           said to be such a place.) Verses 12 to 19 in the Hawaiian (13
           to 21 in the translation) describe the spirited scene.

           It is somewhat difficult to determine whether the Kauna
           mentioned in the next poem is the name of the woman or of the
           stormy cape. In the mind of a Hawaiian poet the inanimate and
           the animate are often tied so closely together in thought and
           in speech as to make it hard to decide which is intended.

           This mele, based on a story of amorous rivalry, relates to a
           contest which arose between two young women of rank regarding
           the favors of that famous warrior and general of Kamehameha,
           Kalaimoku, whom the successful intrigante described as _ka
           makua o makou_ (verse 8), our father, i.e., our guardian. The
           point of view is that of the victorious intrigante, and in
           speaking of her defeated rival she uses the ironical language
           of the sixth verse, _He kanaka ke koa no ka ehu ahiahi_
           meaning that her opponent's chance of success faded with the
           evening twilight, whereas her own success was crowned with
[Page 194] the glow of morning, _O ia nei ko ka ehu kakahiaka_ (verse
           7). The epithet _kanaka_ hints ironically that her rival is
           of lower rank than herself, though in reality the rank of her
           rival may have been superior to her own.

           The language, as pointed out by the author's informant, is
           marked with an elegance that stamps it as the product of a
           courtly circle.

           the rescue of their mother, Hina, who had been kidnaped by a
           marauding chief and carried from her home in Hilo to the bold
           headland of Haupu, Molokai. Niheu is generally stigmatized as
           _kolohe_ (verse 11), mischievous, for no other reason
           apparently than that he was an active spirit, full of
           courage, given to adventure and heaven-defying audacities,
           such as put the Polynesian Mawi and the Greek Prometheus in
           bad odor with the gods of their times. One of these offensive
           actions was Niheu's theft of a certain _ulu_, breadfruit,
           which one of the gods rolled with a noise like that of
           thunder in the underground caverns of the southern regions of
           the world. Niheu is represented as a great sport, an athlete,
           skilled in all the games of his people. The worst that could
           be said of him was that he had small regard for other
           people's rights and that he was slow to pay his debts of
           honor.]

           After the death of Lohiau, his best friend, Paoa, came before
           Pele determined to invite death by pouring out the vials of
           his wrath on the head of the goddess. The sisters of Pele
           sought to avert the impending tragedy and persuaded him to
           soften his language and to forego mere abuse. Paoa, a
           consummate actor, by his dancing, which has been perpetuated
           in the hula Pele, and by his skillfully-worded prayer-songs,
           one of which is given above, not only appeased Pele, but won
           her.

           The piece next appearing is also a song that was a prayer,
           and seems to have been uttered by the same mouth that,
           groaned forth the one given above.
