           along the coast of Puna, the middens, no doubt, of the
           old-time people. _Koele_ was a term applied to the opihi that

                               XXIX.--THE HULA KOLANI


           For the purpose of this book the rating of any variety of
           hula must depend not so much on the grace and rhythm of its
           action on the stage as on the imaginative power and dignity
           of its poetry. Judgedin this way, the _kolani_ is one of the
           most interesting and important of the hulas. Its performance
           seems to have made no attempt at sensationalism, yet it was
           marked by a peculiar elegance. This must have been due in a
           measure to the fact that only adepts--_olohe_--those of the
           most finished skill in the art of hula, took part in its
           presentation. It was a hula of gentle, gracious action, acted
           and sung while the performers kept a sitting position, and
           was without instrumental accompaniment. The fact that this
           hula was among the number chosen for presentation before the
           king (Kamehameha III) while on a tour of Oahu in the year
           1846 or 1847 is emphatic testimony as to the esteem in which
           it was held by the Hawaiians themselves.

           The mele that accompanied this hula when performed for the
           king's entertainment at Waimanalo was the following:

                He ua la, he ua,
                He ua pi'i mai;
                Noe-noe halau,
                Halau loa o Lono.
            5   O lono oe;
                Pa-a-a na pali
                I ka hana a Ikuwa--
                Poha ko-ele-ele.
                A Welehu ka malama,
           10   Noho i Makali'i;
                Li'i-li'i ka hana.
                Aia a e'e-u,
                He eu ia no ka la hiki.
                Hiki mai ka Lani,
           15   Nauweuwe ka honua,
                Ka hana a ke ola'i nui:
                Moe pono ole ko'u po--
                Na niho ai kalakala,
                Ka hana a ka Niuhi
           20   A mau i ke kai loa.
                He loa o ka hiki'na.
                A ua noa, a ua noa.
[Page 217]

                     [Translation]

                Lo, the rain, the rain!
                The rain is approaching;
                The dance-hall is murky,
                The great hall of Lono.
            5   Listen! its mountain walls
                Are stunned with the clatter,
                As when in October,
                Heaven's thunderbolts shatter.
                Then follows Welehu,
           10   The month of the Pleiads.
                Scanty the work then done,
                Save as one's driven.
                Spur comes with the sun,
                When day has arisen.
           15   Now comes the Heaven-born;
                The whole land doth shake,
                As with an earthquake;
                Sleep quits then my bed:
                How shall this maw be fed!
           20   Great maw of the shark--
                Eyes that gleam in the dark
                Of the boundless sea!
                Rare the king's visits to me.
                All is free, all is free!

           If the author of this Hawaiian idyl sought to adapt its
           descriptive imagery to the features of any particular
           landscape, it would almost seem as if he had in view the very
           region in which Kauikeaouli found himself in the year 1847 as
           he listened to the mele of this unknown Hawaiian Theocritus.
           Under the spell of this poem, one is transported to the
           amphitheater of Mauna-wili, a valley separated from Waimanalo
           only by a rampart of hills. At one's back are the abrupt
           walls of Konahuanui; at the right, and encroaching so as
           almost to shut in the front, stands the knife-edge of
           Olomana; to the left range the furzy hills of Ulamawao;
           while directly to the front, looking north, winds the green
           valley, whose waters, before reaching the ocean, spread out
           into the fish-ponds and duck swamps of Kailua. It would seem
           as if this must have been the very picture the idyllic poet
           had in mind. This smiling, yet rock-walled, amphitheater was
           the vast dance-hall of Lono--_Halau loa o Lono_ (verse
           4)--whose walls were deafened, stunned (_pa-a-a_, verse 6),
           by the tumult and uproar of the multitude that always
           followed in the wake of a king, a multitude whose night-long
           revels banished sleep: _Moe pono ole ko'u po_ (verse 17). The
           poet seems to be thinking of this same hungry multitude in
           verse 18, _Na niho ai kalakala_, literally the teeth that
           tear the food; also when he speaks of the Niuhi (verse 19), a
           mythical shark, the glow of whose eyes was said to be visible
[Page 218  for a great distance in the ocean, _A mau i ke
           kai loa_ (verse 20). _Ikuwa, Welehu, Makali'i_ (verses 7, 9,
           and 10). These were months in the Hawaiian year corresponding
           to a part of September, October and November, and a part of
           December. The Hawaiian year began when the Pleiades
           (_Makali'i_) rose at sunset (about November 20), and was
           divided into twelve lunar months of twenty-nine or thirty
           days each. The names of the months differed somewhat in the
           different parts of the group. The month _Ikuwa_ is said to
           have been named from its being the season of thunderstorms.
           This does not of itself settle the time of its occurrence,
           for the reason that in Hawaii the procession of the seasons
           and the phenomena of weather follow no definite order; that
           is, though electrical storms occur, there is no definite
           season of thunderstorms.

           _Maka-li'i_ (verse 10) was not only the name of a month and
           the name applied to the Pleiades, but was also a name given
           the cool, the rainy, season. The name more commonly given
           this season was _Hooilo_. The Makahiki period, continuing
           four months, occurred at this time of the year. This was a
           season when the people rested from unnecessary labor and
           devoted themselves to festivals, games, and special religious
           observances. Allusion is made to this avoidance of toil in
           the words _Li'ili'i ka hana_ (verse 11).

           One can not fail to perceive a vein of gentle sarcasm
           cropping up in this idyl, softened, however, by a spirit of
           honest good feeling. Witness the following: _Noe-noe_ (verse
           3), primarily meaning cloudy, conveys also the idea of
           agreeable coolness and refreshment. Again, while the
           multitude that follows the king is compared to the ravenous
           man-eating _Niuhi_ (verse 19), the final remark as to the
           rarity of the king's visits, _He loa o ka hiki'na_ (verse
           21), may be taken not only as a salve to atone for the
           satire, but as a sly self-gratulation that the affliction is
           not to be soon repeated.

                               XXX.--THE HULA KOLEA


           There was a peculiar class of hulas named after animals, in
           each one of which the song-maker developed some
           characteristic of the animal in a fanciful way, while the
           actors themselves aimed to portray the animal's movements in
           a mimetic fashion. To this class belongs the hula _kolea_.[411]
           It was a peculiar dance, performed, as an informant asserts,
           by actors who took the kneeling posture, all being placed in
           one row and facing in the same direction. There were gestures
           without stint, arms, heads, and bodies moving in a fashion
           that seemed to imitate in a far-off way the movements of the
           bird itself. There was no instrumental accompaniment to the
           music. The following mele is one that was given with this
           hula:

                Kolea kai piha![412]
                I aha mai nei?
                Ku-non[413] mai nei.
                E aha kakou?
            5   E ai kakou.[414]
                Nohea ka ai?[415]
                No Kahiki mai.[415]
                Hiki mai ka Lani,[415]
                Olina Hawaii,
           10   Mala'ela'e ke ala,
                Nou, e ka Lani.
                Puili pu ke aloha,
                Pili me ka'u manu.[416]
                Ka puana a ka moe?
           15   Moe oe a hoolana
[Page 220]      Ka hali'a i hiki mai;
                Ooe pu me a'u
                Noho pu i ka wai aliali.
                Hai'na ia ka pauna.
           20   O ka hua o ke kolea, aia i Kahiki.[417]
                Hiki mai kou aloha, mae'ele au.

           [Footnote 411: The plover.]

           [Footnote 412: _Kolea kai piha_. The kolea is a feeder along
           the shore, his range limited to a narrower strip as the tide
           rises. The snare was one of the methods used by the Hawaiians
           for the capture of this bird. In his efforts to escape when
           snared he made that futile bobbing motion with his head that
           must be familiar to every hunter.]

           [Footnote 413: Usually the bobbing motion, _ku-nou_, is the
           prelude to flight; but the snared bird can do nothing more, a
           fact which suggests to the poet the nodding and bowing of two
           lovers when they meet.]

           [Footnote 414: _E ai kakou_. Literally, let us eat. While this
           figure of speech often has a sensual meaning, it does not
           necessarily imply grossness. Hawaiian literalness and
           narrowness of vocabulary is not to be strained to the
           overthrow of poetical sentiment.]

           [Footnote 415: To the question _Nohea ka ai?_, whence the food?
           that is, the bird, the poet answers, _No Kahiki mai_, from
           Kahiki, from some distant region, the gift of heaven, it may
           be, as implied in the next line, _Hiki mai ka Lani_. The
           coming of the king, or chief, _Lani_, literally, the
           heaven-born, with the consummation of the love. Exactly what
           this connection is no one can say.]

           [Footnote 416: In the expression _Pili me ka'u manu_ the poet
           returns to his figure of a bird as representing a loved one.]

           [Footnote 417: _O ka hua o ke kolea, aia i Kahiki_. In
           declaring that the egg of the kolea is laid in a foreign
           land, Kahiki, the poet enigmatizes, basing his thought on
           some fancied resemblance between the mystery of love and the
           mystery of the kolea's birth.]

                        [Translation]

                A plover at the full of the sea--
                What, pray, is it saying to me?
                It keeps bobbing its noddy.
                To do what would you counsel?
            5   Why, eat its plump body!
                Whence comes the sweet morsel?
                From the land of Kahiki.
                When our sovereign appears,
                Hawaii gathers for play,
           10   Stumble-blocks cleared from the way--
                Fit rule of the king's highway.
                Let each one embrace then his love;
                For me, I'll keep to my dove.
                Hark now, the signal for bed!
           15   Attentive then to love's tread,
                While a wee bird sings in the soul,
                My love comes to me heart-whole--
                Then quaff the waters of bliss.
                Say what is the key to all this?
           20   The plover egg's laid in Kahiki.
                Your love, when it comes, finds me dumb.

           The plover--kolea--is a wayfarer in Hawaii; its nest-home is
           in distant lands, Kahiki. The Hawaiian poet finds in all this
           something that reminds him of the spirit of love.

                             XXXI.--THE HULA MANO


           The hula _mano_, shark-dance, as its name signifies, was a
           performance that takes class with the hula kolea, already
           mentioned, as one of the animal dances. But little can be
           said about the physical features of this hula as a dance,
           save that the performers took a sitting position, that the
           action was without sensationalism, and that there was no
           instrumental accompaniment. The cantillation of the mele was
           in the distinct and quiet tone and manner which the Hawaiians
           termed ko'i-honua.

           The last and only mention found of its performance in modern
           times was in the year 1847, during the tour, previously
           mentioned, which Kamehameha III made about Oahu. The place
           was the lonely and romantic valley of Waimea, a name already
           historic from having been the scene of the tragic death of
           Lieutenant Hergest (of the ship _Daedalus_) in 1792.

           [Footnote 418: _Lala-kea_. This proper name, as it seems once
           to have been, has now become rather the designation of a
           whole class of man-eating sea-monsters. The Hawaiians
           worshiped individual sharks as demigods, in the belief that
           the souls of the departed at death, or even before death,
           sometimes entered and took possession of them, and that they
           at times resumed human form. To this class belonged the
           famous shark Niuhi (verse 5).]

           [Footnote 419: _Papa-ku o Lono_. This was one of the underlying
           strata of the earth that must be passed before reaching
           _Milu_, the hades of the Hawaiians. The cosmogony of the
           southern Polynesians, according to Mr. Tregear, recognized
           ten _papa_, or divisions. "The first division was the earth's
           surface; the second was the abode of Rongo-ma-tane and
           Haumia-tiketike; ... the tenth was Meto, or Ameto, or
           Aweto, wherein the soul of man found utter extinction." (The
           Maori-Polynesian Comparative Dictionary, by Edward Tregear,
           F.R.G.S., etc., Wellington, New Zealand, 1891.)]

           [Footnote 420: Verses 8 and 9 are from an old proverb which the
           Hawaiians put into the following quatrain:

                A pua ka wiliwili,
                A nanahu ka mano;
                A pua ka wahine u'i,
                A nanahu ke kanawai.

                    [Translation]

                When flowers the wiliwili,
                Then bites the shark;
                When flowers a young woman.
                Then bites the law.

           The people came to take this old saw seriously and literally,
           and during the season when the wiliwili (Erythrina
           monosperma) was clothed in its splendid tufts of brick-red,
           mothers kept their children from swimming into the deep sea
           by setting before them the terrors of the shark.]

                            [Translation]

                                _Song_

                    Alas! I am seized by the shark, great shark!
                    Lala-kea with triple-banked teeth.
                    The stratum of Lono is gone,
                    Torn up by the monster shark,
                5   Niuhi with fiery eyes,
                    That flamed in the deep blue sea.
                    Alas! and alas!
                    When flowers the wili-wili tree,
                    That is the time when the shark-god bites.
                10  Alas! I am seized by the huge shark!
                    O blue sea, O dark sea,
                    Foam-mottled sea of Kane!
                    What pleasure I took in my dancing!
                    Alas! now consumed by the monster shark!

           Who would imagine that a Hawaiian would ever picture the god
           of love as a shark? As a bird, yes; but as a shark! What a
           light this fierce idyl casts on the imagination of the people
           of ancient Hawaii!

                             XXXII.--THE HULA ILIO


           The dog took his part and played his enthusiastic role in the
           domestic life of every Hawaiian. He did not starve in a
           fool's paradise, a neglected object of man's superstitious
           regard, as in Constantinople; nor did he vie with kings and
           queens in the length and purity of his pedigree, as in
           England; but in Hawaii he entered with full heart of sympathy
           into all of man's enterprises, and at his death bequeathed
           his body a sacrifice to men and gods. It was fitting that the
           Hawaiian poet should celebrate the dog and his altogether
           virtuous and altruistic services to mankind. The hula _ilio_
           may be considered as part of Hawaii's tribute to man's most
           faithful friend, the dog.

           The hula ilio was a classic performance that demanded of the
           actors much physical stir; they shifted their position, now
           sitting, now standing; they moved from place to place;
           indulged in many gestures, sometimes as if imitating the
           motions of the dog. This hula has long been out of
           commission. Like the two animal-hulas previously mentioned,
           it was performed without the aid of instrumental
           accompaniment.

           The allusions in this mele are to the mythical story that
           tells of Kane's drinking, revels on the heights about Waipi'o
           valley; how he and his fellows by the noise of their furious
           conching disturbed the prayers and rituals of King Liloa and
           his priests, Kane himself being the chief offender by his
           blowing on the conch-shell Kihapu, stolen from Liloa's temple
           of Paka'alana: its recovery by the wit and dramatic action of
           the gifted dog Puapua-lenalena. (See p. 131.)
