_material?_

As Mind they are real, but not as matter.  All beauty           6
and goodness are in and of Mind, emanating from God;
but when we change the nature of beauty and goodness
from Mind to matter, the beauty is marred, through a            9
false conception, and, to the material senses, evil takes
the place of good.

Has not the truth in Christian Science met a response           12
from Prof. S. P. Langley, the young American astronomer?
He says that "color is in _us_," not "in the rose;" and he
adds that this is not "any metaphysical subtlety," but a        15
fact "almost universally accepted, within the _last few_
_years_, by physicists."

_Is not the basis of Mind-healing a destruction of the evi-_    18
_dence of the material senses, and restoration of the true_
_evidence of spiritual sense?_

It is, so far as you perceive and understand this predi-        21
cate and postulate of Mind-healing; but the Science of
Mind-healing is best understood in practical demonstra-
tion.  The proof of what you apprehend, in the simplest         24
definite and absolute form of healing, can alone answer
this question of how much you understand of Christian
Science Mind-healing.   Not that all healing is Science,        1
by any means; but that the simplest case, healed in Science,
is as demonstrably scientific, in a small degree, as the most   3
difficult case so treated.

The infinite and subtler conceptions and consistencies
of Christian Science are set forth in my work Science and       6
Health.

_Is man material or spiritual?_

In Science, man is the manifest reflection of God, per-         9
feet and immortal Mind.  He is the likeness of God; and
His likeness would be lost if inverted or perverted.

According to the evidence of the so-called physical             12
senses, man is material, fallen, sick, depraved, mortal.
Science and spiritual sense contradict this, and they afford
the only true evidence of the being of God and man, the         15
material evidence being wholly false.

Jesus said of personal evil, that "the truth abode not
in him," because there is no material sense.  Matter, as        18
matter, has neither sensation nor personal intelligence.
As a pretension to be Mind, matter is a lie, and "the
father of lies;" Mind is not in matter, and Spirit cannot       21
originate its opposite, named matter.

According to divine Science, Spirit no more changes its
species, by evolving matter from Spirit, than natural           24
science, so-called, or material laws, bring about altera-
tion of species by transforming minerals into vegetables
or plants into animals, -- thus confusing and confounding       27
the three great kingdoms.  No rock brings forth an apple;       1
no pine-tree produces a mammal or provides breast-milk
for babes.                                                      3

To sense, the lion of to-day is the lion of six thousand
years ago; but in Science, Spirit sends forth its own harm-
less likeness.                                                  6

_How should I undertake to demonstrate Christian Science_
_in healing the sick?_

As I have given you only an epitome of the Principle,           9
so I can give you here nothing but an outline of the prac-
tice. Be honest, be true to thyself, and true to others;
then it follows thou wilt be strong in God, the eternal         12
good. Heal through Truth and Love; there is no other
healer.

In all moral revolutions, from a lower to a higher con-         15
dition of thought and action, Truth is in the minority and
error has the majority.  It is not otherwise in the field
of Mind-healing.  The man who calls himself a Christian         18
Scientist, yet is false to God and man, is also uttering
falsehood about good.  This falsity shuts against him the
Truth and the Principle of Science, but opens a way             21
whereby, through will-power, sense may say the unchris-
tian practitioner can heal; but Science shows that he makes
morally worse the invalid whom he is supposed to cure.          24

By this I mean that mortal mind should not be falsely
impregnated.  If by such lower means the health is seem-
ingly restored, the restoration is not lasting, and the patient 27
is liable to a relapse, -- "The last state of that man is       1
worse than the first."

The teacher of Mind-healing who is not a Christian,             3
in the highest sense, is constantly sowing the seeds of
discord and disease.  Even the truth he speaks is more
or less blended with error; and this error will spring up       6
in the mind of his pupil.  The pupil's imperfect knowl-
edge will lead to weakness in practice, and he will be a
poor practitioner, if not a malpractitioner.                    9

The basis of malpractice is in erring human will, and
this will is an outcome of what I call _mortal mind_, -- a
false and temporal sense of Truth, Life, and Love.  To          12
heal, in Christian Science, is to base your practice on
immortal Mind, the divine Principle of man's being; and
this requires a preparation of the heart and an answer          15
of the lips from the Lord.

The Science of healing is the Truth of healing.  If
one is untruthful, his mental state weighs against his          18
healing power; and similar effects come from pride,
envy, lust, and all fleshly vices.

The spiritual power of a scientific, right thought, with-       21
out a direct effort, an audible or even a mental argument,
has oftentimes healed inveterate diseases.

The thoughts of the practitioner should be imbued with          24
a clear conviction of the omnipotence and omnipresence
of God; that He is All, and that there can be none beside
Him; that God is good, and the producer only of good;           27
and hence, that whatever militates against health, har-
mony, or holiness, is an unjust usurper of the throne of        1
the controller of all mankind.  Note this, that if you have
power in error, you forfeit the power that Truth bestows,       3
