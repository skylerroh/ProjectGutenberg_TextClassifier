  No wisdom of my own.

3 I cannot do without thee,
  I do not know the way;
Thou knowest and thou leadest,
  And wilt not let me stray.

4 I cannot do without thee,
  For years are fleeting fast,
And soon, in solemn loneliness,
  The river must be passed.

_Absorbed in Christ._  (635)

Mine eyes and my desire
  Are ever to the Lord;
I love to plead his promises,
  And rest upon his word.

2 Lord, turn thee to my soul;
  Bring thy salvation near;
When will thy hand release my feet
  From sin's destructive snare?

3 When shall the sov'reign grace
  Of my forgiving God
Restore me from those dangerous ways
  My wand'ring feet have trod?

4 Oh, keep my soul from death,
  Nor put my hope to shame;
For I have placed my only trust
  In my Redeemer's name.

_At the Cross._  (694)

I am coming to the cross;
I am poor, and weak, and blind;
I am counting all but dross;
I shall thy salvation find.

Cho.--I am trusting, Lord, in thee,
      Blest Lamb of Calvary;
      Humbly at thy cross I bow;
      Save me, Jesus, save me now.

2 Long my heart has sighed for thee;
Long has evil reigned within;
Jesus sweetly speaks to me--
I will cleanse you from all sin.

3 Here I give my all to thee--
Friends, and time, and earthly store;
Soul and body thine to be--
Wholly thine--forevermore.

4 In the promises I trust;
Now I feel the blood applied;
I am prostrate in the dust;
I with Christ am crucified.

5 Jesus comes! he fills my soul!
Perfected in love I am!
I am ev'ry whit made whole;
Glory! glory to the Lamb!

275     I'll Live for Him. P.M.

_Dedication of Self._

My life, my love I give to thee,
  Thou Lamb of God, who died for me;
Oh, may I ever faithful be
  My Savior and my God.

Cho.--I'll live for him who died for me,
      How happy, then, my life shall be!
      I'll live for him who died for me,
      My Savior and my God.

2 I now believe thou dost receive,
  For thou hast died that I might live;
And now henceforth I'll trust in thee,
  My Savior and my God.

3 Oh, thou who died on Calvary,
  To save my soul and make me free,
I consecrate my life to thee,
  My Savior and my God.


276     Take My Heart, Dear Jesus. P.M.

_The Offered Heart._

Take my heart, dear Jesus,
Make it all thine own,
Let thy Holy Spirit
Break this heart of stone,
And make me all thine own.

Cho.--Take my heart, and let it be
      Ev'ry moment more like thee;
      At thy feet I bow;
      Take my heart just now,
      And make me all thine own.

2 Take my heart, dear Jesus,
Make it pure and clean;
Let thy blood, still flowing,
Wash away my sin,
And make me pure and clean.

3 Take my heart, dear Jesus,
Make it white as snow;
May the cleansing fountain,
May the precious flow,
Still keep me white as snow.

_Self-Dedication_

Take my life, and let it be
  Consecrated, Lord, to thee;
Take my hands and let them move
  At the impulse of thy love.

Cho.--Wash me in the Savior's precious blood, the precious blood,
      Cleanse me in its purifying flood, the healing flood,
      Lord, I give to thee my life and all, to be
      Thine, henceforth, eternally.

2 Take my feet, and let them be
  Swift and beautiful for thee;
Take my voice, and let me sing
  Always, only for my King

3 Take my lips, and let them be
  Filled with messages for thee;
Take my silver and my gold--
  Not a mite would I withhold.

4 Take my moments and my days,
  Let them flow in endless praise;
Take my intellect, and use
  Ev'ry pow'r as thou shalt choose.

5 Take my will, and make it thine;
  It shall be no longer mine;
Take my heart,--it is thine own,--
  It shall be thy royal throne.

6 Take my love,--my Lord, I pour
  At thy feet its treasure-store!
Take myself, and I will be
  Ever, only, all for thee!

_Nearness to Christ Desired._

Lord, weak and impotent I stand,
As fettered by an unseen hand;
Break thou the strong and subtle band,
  And draw me close to thee.

Cho.--Draw me close to thee, Savior,
      Draw me close to thee;
      Beneath thy wing do thou me hide,
      And draw me close to thee.

2 In vain I struggle to be free;
I would, but cannot, fly to thee;
Ope thou the prison door for me,
  And draw me close to thee.

3 Oh, bring me nearer, nearer still,
That thine own peace my soul may fill,
And I may rest in thy sweet will;
  Lord, draw me close to thee.

4 Here, Lord, I would forever bide,
And never wander from thy side;
Beneath thy wing do thou me hide,
  And draw me close to thee.

_Clinging to Christ._     (668)

O holy Savior! Friend unseen,
Since on thine arm thou bid'st me lean,
Help me, throughout life's changing scene,
  By faith to cling to thee!

Cho.--Help me cling to thee, Savior,
      Help me cling to thee!
      Help me, throughout life's changing scene,
      By faith to cling to thee!

2 Without a murmur I dismiss
My former dreams of earthly bliss;
My joy, my recompense be this,
  Each hour to cling to thee!

3 Though faith and hope are often tried,
I ask not, need not, aught beside;
So safe, so calm, so satisfied,
  The soul that clings to thee!

     Charlotte Elliott.

_Communion with Christ._

I am thine, O Lord, I have heard thy voice,
  And it told thy love to me;
But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
  And be closer drawn to thee.

Ref.--Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where thou hast died;
      Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
        To thy precious, bleeding side.

2 Consecrate me now to thy service, Lord,
  By the pow'r of grace divine;
Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,
  And my will be lost in thine.

3 O the pure delight of a single hour
  That before thy throne I spend,
When I kneel in pray'r, and with thee, my God,
  I commune as friend with friend.

4 There are depths of love that I cannot know
  Till I cross the narrow sea,
There are heights of joy that I may not reach
  Till I rest in peace with thee.

_Desire for Purity._

Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole;
I want thee forever to live in my soul;
Break down ev'ry idol, cast out ev'ry foe;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Cho.--Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow;
      Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

2 Lord Jesus, look down from thy throne in the skies,
And help me to make a complete sacrifice;
I give up myself and whatever I know--
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

3 Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;
I wait, blessed Lord, at thy crucified feet,
By faith for my cleansing, I see thy blood flow--
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

4 Lord Jesus, thou seest I patiently wait;
Come now, and within me a new heart create;
To those who have sought thee, thou never said'st no--
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

282     Are You Washed in the Blood? P.M.

_Resting in Christ's Merits._

Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing pow'r?
  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are you fully trusting in his grace this hour?
  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

Cho.--Are you washed in the blood,
      In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?
      Are your garments spotless, are they white as snow?
      Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

2 Are you walking daily by the Savior's side?
  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Do you rest each moment in the Crucified?
  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

3 When the Bridegroom cometh will your robes be white,
  Pure and white in the blood of the Lamb?
Will your soul be ready for the mansions bright?
  And be washed in the blood of the Lamb?

4 Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin,
  And be washed in the blood of the Lamb;
There's a fountain flowing for the soul unclean,
  Oh, be washed in the blood of the Lamb.

283     The Cleansing Wave. C.M.

_It Cleanseth Me._

Oh, now I see the crimson wave,
  The fountain deep and wide;
Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save,
  Points to his wounded side.

Cho.--The cleansing stream I see! I see!
      I plunge, and oh, it cleanseth me;
      Oh, praise the Lord! it cleanseth me,
      It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.

2 I rise to walk in heaven's own light,
  Above the world and sin,
With heart made pure, and garments white,
  And Christ enthroned within.

3 Amazing grace! 'tis heaven below
  To feel the blood applied;
And Jesus, only Jesus know,
  My Jesus crucified.

284     Beulah Land. L.M.

_Rest of Faith._

I've reached the land of corn and wine.
And all its riches freely mine;
Here shines undimmed one blissful day,
For all my night has passed away.

Cho.--O Beulah land, sweet Beulah land,
      As on thy highest mount I stand,
      I look away across the sea,
      Where mansions are prepared for me,
      And view the shining glory shore,
      My heaven, my home forevermore.

2 The Savior comes and walks with me,
And sweet communion here have we;
He gently leads me with his hand,
For this is heaven's border land.

3 A sweet perfume upon the breeze,
Is borne from ever vernal trees,
And flowers that never fading grow
Where streams of life forever flow.

4 The zephyrs seem to float to me,
Sweet sounds of heaven's melody,
As angels, with the white-robed throng,
Join in the sweet redemption song.

285     The Land of Beulah. 8s & 7s. D.

_Beulah Land._

I am dwelling on the mountain,
  Where the golden sunlight gleams
O'er a land whose wondrous beauty
  Far exceeds my fondest dreams;
Where the air is pure ethereal,
  Laden with the breath of flow'rs,
They are blooming by the fountain,
  'Neath the amaranthine bow'rs.

Cho.--Is not this land of Beulah,
        Blessed, blessed land of light?
      Where the flowers bloom forever,
        And the sun is always bright.

2 I can see far down the mountains,
  Where I wandered weary years,
Often hindered in my journey
  By the ghosts of doubts and fears;
Broken vows and disappointments,
  Thickly sprinkled all the way,
But the Spirit led unerring,
  To the land I hold to-day.

3 I am drinking at the fountain,
  Where I ever would abide;
For I've tasted life's pure river,
  And my soul is satisfied;
There's no thirsting for life's pleasures,
  Nor adorning, rich and gay,
For I've found a richer treasure.
  One that fadeth not away.

4 Tell me not of heavy crosses,
  Nor the burdens hard to bear,
For I've found this great salvation
  Makes each burden light appear;
And I love to follow Jesus,
  Gladly counting all but dross,
Worldly honors all forsaking
  For the glory of the cross.

5 Oh, the cross has wondrous glory!
  Oft I've proved this to be true;
When I'm in the way so narrow
  I can see a pathway thro';
And how sweetly Jesus whispers:
  Take the cross, thou need'st not fear,
For I've tried this way before thee.
  And the glory lingers near.

_Christ Incomparable._  (590)

Majestic sweetness sits enthroned
  Upon the Savior's brow;
His head with radiant glories crowned,
  His lips with grace o'erflow.

2 No mortal can with him compare
  Among the sons of men;
Fairer is he, than all the fair
  Who fill the heavenly train.

3 He saw me plunged in deep distress,
  And flew to my relief;
For me he bore the shameful cross,
  And carried all my grief.

4 To heaven, the place of his abode,
  He brings my weary feet;
Shows me the glories of my God,
  And makes my joys complete.

And sing I must, for Christ is mine!
  Christ shall my song employ.

2 Christ is my Prophet, Priest, and King;
  My Prophet full of light,
My great High Priest before the throne,
  My King of heavenly might.

3 Christ is my peace; he died for me,
  For me he gave his blood;
And, as my wondrous Sacrifice,
  Offered himself to God.

Oh, for a thousand tongues, to sing
  My great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of my God and King
  The triumphs of his grace.

2 My gracious Master, and my God,
  Assist me to proclaim--
To spread, through all the earth abroad,
  The honors of thy name.

3 Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
  That bids our sorrows cease;
'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
  'Tis life, and health, and peace.

4 He breaks the power of canceled sin,
  He sets the pris'ner free:
His blood can make the foulest clean--
  His blood availed for me.

5 He speaks--and, list'ning to his voice
  New life the dead receive;
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
  The humble poor believe.

6 Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,
  Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Savior come;
  And leap, ye lame, for joy.

2 O Lord! we cannot silent be;
  By love we are constrained
To offer our best thanks to thee,
  Our Savior, and our Friend.

3 Let every tongue thy goodness show,
  And spread abroad thy fame;
Let every heart with praise o'erflow,
  And bless thy sacred name.

4 Worship and honor, thanks and love,
  Be to our Jesus given,
By men below, by hosts above,
  By all in earth and heaven.

Awake, awake, the sacred song,
  To our incarnate Lord;
Let every heart and every tongue
  Adore th' eternal Word.

2 That awful Word, that sovereign Power,
  By whom the worlds were made;
Oh, happy morn--illustrious hour--
  Was once in flesh arrayed.

3 To dwell with misery here below,
  The Savior left the skies,
And sunk to wretchedness and woe,
  That worthless man might rise.

4 Adoring angels tuned their songs,
  To hail the joyful day;
With rapture, then, let human tongues
  Their grateful worship pay.

     Anne Steele, 1760
