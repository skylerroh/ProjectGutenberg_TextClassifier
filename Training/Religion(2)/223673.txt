CHRISTMAS

Silent night, Holy night

Fr. Gruber
  Arr. by Nicola A. Montani

Moderato

1.
Silent night, holy night!
Bethlehem sleeps yet what light
Floats around the holy pair;
Songs of Angels fill the air
Strains of heavenly peace,
Strains of heavenly peace.

2.
Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds first see the light,
Hear the Alleluias ring
Which the Angel chorus sing
"Christ the Savior has come
Christ the Savior has come!"

3.
Silent night, holy night!
Son of God! Oh, what light
Radiates from Thy manger bed
Over realms with darkness spread,
Thou in Bethlehem born,
Thou in Bethlehem born.

CHRISTMAS

A Virgin most pure, as the Prophets did tell
Ancient Carol

Traditional Melody
Arr. by N. A. M.
Slowly

1.
A Virgin most pure, as the Prophets did tell,
Hath brought forth a Saviour, as it hath befell,
To be our Redeemer from death, hell and sin,
Which Adam's transgression had wrapped us in.

Chorus
Rejoice and be merry, Set sorrow aside
Jesus our Saviour was born on this tide.

2.
In Bethlehem city in Jewry it was,
Where Joseph and Mary together did pass,
And there to be taxed with many one more.
For Caesar commanded the same should be so.

3.
But when they had entered the city so fair,
A number of people so mighty was there
That Mary and Joseph, whose substance was small,
Could procure in the Inn no lodging at all.

4.
Then they were constrained in a stable to lie,
Where oxen and asses they used there to tie;
Their lodging so simple they held it no scorn,
But against the next morning a Saviour was born.

5.
The King of glory to this world being brought
Small store of fine linen to wrap him was sought;
When Mary had swaddled her young Son so sweet,
Within an ox manger she laid Him to sleep.

6.
Then God sent an angel from heaven so high,
To certain poor shepherds in fields where they lie,
And charged them no longer in sorrow to stay,
Because that our Saviour was born on this day.

7.
Then presently after the shepherds did spy
A number of angels appear in the sky;
Who joyfully talked and sweetly did sing,
"To God be all glory, our heavenly King."

CHRISTMAS

Hark! the Herald Host is singing

E. Humperdinck
Joyously

1.
Hark! The herald host is singing,
Thro' the silent holy night,
Tidings of great joy they're bringing,
From yon starry azure height.
And each heart is filled with gladness,
At the message which they bring;
"Christ is born, forget all sadness,
Trust in Him, your Saviour King!"

2.
And behold the stars bright glowing,
Shed o'er earth their radiant light,
While from Angels' lips are flowing
Anthems thro' the holy night.
Bright each window now is glowing,
Lighted by the Christmas tree;
And each cheek with joy is glowing,
And each heart is filled with glee.

3.
Soft the messengers from heaven
Wing their flight from home to home;
Bearing lessons God hath given
Unto all the earth that roam.
"Welcome, welcome Christmas evening
Bringing peace and love to earth!"
Show your gratitude, rejoicing,
Christians in your Saviour's birth!

Sleep, Holy Babe
(For additional Christmas Hymns see Hymns Nos. 126 $ 127 and Latin Hymns).

Tr. Rev. E. Caswall
Traditional Melody

Semplice

1.
Sleep, Holy Babe,
Upon Thy Mothers breast!
Great Lord of earth and sea and sky,
How sweet it is to see Thee lie
In such a place of rest!

2.
Sleep, Holy Babe,
Thine Angels watch around;
All bending low with folded wings
Before th'Incarnate King of Kings,
In rev'rent awe profound.

3.
Sleep, Holy Babe,
While I with Mary gaze
In joy upon that Face awhile,
Upon the loving Infant smile,
Which there divinely plays.

4.
Sleep, Holy Babe,
O snatch Thy brief repose;
Too quickly will Thy slumber break,
And Thou to lengthened pains awake,
That death alone shall close.

THE MOST HOLY NAME

O Jesus, Thou the beauty art
Jesu, decus Angelicum

St. Bernard
Tr. Rev. E. Caswall
Nicola A. Montani

Andante religioso

1.
O Jesus, Thou the beauty art
Of Angel worlds above;
Thy name is music to the heart
Inflaming it with love
Celestial sweetness unalloy'd
Who eat Thee hunger still;
Who drink of Thee still feel a void
Which naught but Thee canst fill.

2.
O my sweet Jesus, hear the sighs
Which unto Thee I send;
To Thee mine inmost spirit cries,
My being's hope and end.
Stay with us Lord, with Thy light
Illume the soul's abyss;
Dispel the darkness of the night
And fill the world with bliss.

THE MOST HOLY NAME

To the Name that brings salvation
Processional

Dr. J. M. Neale
Nicola A. Montani

Moderato

1.
To the Name that brings salvation,
Honor, worship, let us pay
Which for many a generation
Hid in God's foreknowledge lay.
But with holy exultation
We may sing aloud today.

2.
Name of gladness, Name of pleasure,
By this tongue ineffable
Name of sweetness passing measure
To the ear delectable,
'Tis our safeguard and our treasure,
'Tis our help 'gainst sin and hell.

3.
'Tis the Name for adoration,
'Tis the Name of victory,
'Tis the Name for meditation
In this vale of misery,
'Tis the Name for veneration
By the citizens on high.

4.
'Tis the Name that whoso preaches
Finds it music to the ear;
Who in pray'r this Name beseeches
Sweetest comfort findeth near;
Who its perfect wisdom reacheth
Heav'nly joy possesseth here.

Jesus the very thought of Thee
Jesu, dulcis memoria

St. Bernard
Tr. Rev. E. Caswall
Traditional Melody

Religioso

1.
Jesus the very though of Thee,
With sweetness fills my breast;
But sweeter far Thy Face to see
And in Thy presence rest.

2.
Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame
Nor can the mem'ry find
A sweeter sound than Thy blest Name,
O Saviour of mankind.

3.
O Hope of ev'ry contrite heart,
O joy of all the meek,
To those who fall, how kind Thou art,
How good to those who seek.

4.
Jesus, our only joy be Thou,
As Thou our prize wilt be;
O Jesus, be our glory now
And through eternity.

LENT AND PASSIONTIDE

He Who once, in righteous vengeance
Ira justa conditoris

(Feast of the Precious Blood)

Tr. Rev. E. Caswall
J. Mohr
Arr. by N. A. M.

Moderato

1.
He who once, in righteous vengeance,
Whelm'd the world beneath the flood,
Once again in mercy cleansed it
With the stream of His own Blood,
Coming from His throne on high
On the painful cross to die.

2.
Blest with this all saving shower,
Earth her beauty straight resumed;
In the place of thorns and briers
Myrtles sprang and roses bloom'd
Bitter wormwood of the waste
Into honey changed its taste.

3.
When before the Judge we tremble,
Conscious of his broken laws,
May this Blood in that dread hour
Cry aloud and plead our cause;
Bid our guilty terrors cease,
Be our pardon and our peace.

"Man of Sorrows, wrapt in grief"

M. Bridges
From a Slovak Hymnal
Arr. by N. A. M.

Andante Mod

1.
Man of sorrows, wrapt in grief,
Bow Thine ear to our relief;
Thou for us the path hast trod
Of the dreadful wrath of God;
Thou the cup of fire hast drained
Till its light alone remained.
Lamb of Love! We look to Thee;
Hear our mournful litany.

2.
By the garden, fraught with woe,
Whither Thou full oft wouldst go;
By Thine agony of prayer
In the desolation there;
By the dire and deep distress
Of that myst'ry fathomless;
Lord, our tears in mercy see;
Hearken to our litany.

3.
By the chalice brimming o'er
With disgrace and torment sore;
By those lips which fain would pray
That it might but pass away;
By the Heart which drank it dry,
Lest a rebel race should die
Be Thy pity, Lord our plea;
Hear our solemn litany.

4.
Man of Sorrows! Let Thy grief
Purchase for us our relief;
Lord of Mercy! Bow Thine ear,
Slow to anger, swift to hear;
By the Cross's royal road
Lead us to the throne of God,
There for aye to sing to Thee
Heav'n's triumphant litany.

By the blood that flowed from Thee
Litany of the Passion

C. M. Caddell
Nicola. A. Montani

Lento ma non troppo

1.
By the blood that flowed from Thee
In Thy bitter agony;
By the scourge so meekly borne;
By Thy purple robe of scorn;

1st Chorus
Jesus, Saviour, hear our cry!

2d Chorus
Thou wert suff'ring once as we;

Tutti
We thy children sing to Thee.

2.
By the thorns that crowned Thy Head;
By Thy sceptre of a reed;
By Thy Footsteps faint and slow
Weighted beneath Thy Cross of woe,

3.
By the nails and pointed spear;
By Thy people's cruel jeer;
By Thy dying pray'r which rose
Begging mercy for Thy foes.

4.
By the darkness thick as night
Blotting out the sun from sight;
By the cry with which in death
Thou didst yield Thy parting Breath.

5.
By Thy weeping Mother's woe;
By the sword that pierced her through,
When, in anguish standing by,
On the Cross she saw Thee die.

Oh come and mourn with me awhile
Jesus Crucified

Father Faber
Nicola A. Montani
Andante religioso

1.
Oh come an mourn with me awhile!
See, Mary calls us to her side;
Oh come and let us mourn with her;
Jesus, our Love, is crucified!

2.
Have we no tears to shed for Him,
While soldiers scoff and Jews deride?
Ah! Look how patiently He hangs;
Jesus, our Love, is crucified!

3.
How fast His Hand and Feet are nailed;
His blessed Tongue with thirst is tied;
His failing eyes are blind with Blood;
Jesus, our Love, is crucified!

4.
Seven times He spoke, seven words of love,
And all three hours His silence cried
For mercy on the souls of men;
Jesus, our Love, is crucified!

5.
Death came, and Jesus meekly bowed;
His failing eyes He strove to guide
With mindful love to Mary's face,
Jesus, our Love, is crucified!

6.
Come take thy stand beneath the Cross
And let the blood from out that Side
Fall gently on thee, drop by drop,
Jesus, our Love, is crucified!
