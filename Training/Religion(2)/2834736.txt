If all men had an equal love for God, the supreme Good, they would then
all be of one heart and of one mind, and the sincerity and unanimity which
they would manifest in the love of God, would cordially unite them to each
other.

2. But instead of this, every man loves himself, and pursues the
inclinations of his own heart, so that hardly two can agree together. For
as he whose heart is set upon honor, cannot but hate and envy every one
that is preferred before him; so from these different interests and
inclinations, nothing can proceed but emulation, strife, and discord.
Moreover, as he that pursues his own will, and courts the esteem of men,
makes himself his own god, there must by consequence be as many of these
idols and false gods as there are proud, ambitious men in the world. Hence
arise envy, hatred, wars, and fightings, whilst every one is bent upon
increasing and defending his own grandeur, in opposition to that of his
neighbors. Hence it plainly appears that as the love of God is the bond of
peace and union; so self-love is the root and cause of all the discord and
contention that is in the world.



Chapter XXXV.


                    Showing How We Ought To Love God.


    _Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart,
    and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned._--1 TIM. 1:5.


There is no better way of convincing a man than by appealing to his own
conscience. There, as in a glass, we may read our duty much more plainly
than ten thousand teachers can instruct us. We have already shown that it
is a point of natural equity to love God above all things, and that he who
does otherwise, sets himself up as his own idol. And now, if any man
desire to know to what his duty to God obliges him, let him look into
himself, and examine his own heart, and conclude that whatsoever he would
have done for himself, _that_ he is obliged to do for God. Therefore, as
self-love is natural to us all, we must reverse that, and offer to God
that which we unjustly arrogate to ourselves, by loving him as we have
hitherto loved ourselves.

2. Wherefore, as thou now lovest thine own will, and endeavorest to
gratify it in all things, so thou must, for the future, prefer the will of
God to thine own will, and think it better to submit to God's good
pleasure than to humor and gratify thyself. Thou art in love with honor
and esteem, and wouldest have everybody bow to thy superior merit and
character; turn now this inclination of thine, and apply it to promote the
glory of God, and pray that all men may unite to do the same. As thou hast
hitherto been angry with every one that has opposed thee in thy pursuits
of glory, so oughtest thou now to oppose those that oppose the glory of
God.

3. Whilst thy heart is full of self-love, thou art greedy of praise, and
wouldest have everybody think and speak well of thee; do thou the same for
God; labor and pray that God may be glorified by all men, and that every
creature may praise and magnify His name. As thou art very industrious to
be thought a man of truth and honesty, and wouldest be very uneasy to be
counted a liar; so oughtest thou also cheerfully and industriously to
propagate and vindicate the truth and veracity of God. From all which it
appears that every man may read in the book of his own conscience the
obligation he is under to love and honor God rather than himself.



Chapter XXXVI.


                  Divine Joy, The Fruit Of Divine Love.


    _Let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice._--PS. 5:11.


The end and perfection of everything is the fruit it bears, or the effects
it produces, which are as various as the seeds from whence they spring.
Therefore, as there are two different seeds or roots in man, namely, the
love of God and the love of ourselves, which are diametrically opposite to
each other; so likewise are the fruits which they produce. Now the end and
fruit of all human actions is either joy or sorrow. Joy, as it is a good
fruit, must necessarily proceed from a good root; and sorrow, being evil,
must proceed from an evil root; that is, in short, all true joy must
proceed from the love of God, and all sorrow and anguish of mind from the
love of ourselves.

2. For as all joy arises from love, and depends upon it, such as is the
_love_, such also must be the _joy_. If the love be divine, the joy will
be divine; if earthly, the joy also will be earthly. Now so long as our
hearts are united to God by true love, they cannot but rejoice and be
happy in him. This is a foretaste of eternal life, in which both our love
and our joy shall be completed and perfected together. Therefore, as we
shall there live eternally unto God, so our love also shall be eternal;
and as our love shall be perfected, so it shall be united with a perfect,
absolute, infinite, and eternal good, being itself also perfect,
unchangeable, constant, and eternal. And from a love so pure, immaculate,
and heavenly, shall flow a river of joy, divine, pure, precious, full of
rapture, full of grace, glory, and immortality.

3. For eternal life itself is nothing but this eternal joy, with some
drops of which, faithful souls, even in this life, have been often
refreshed and comforted. This is the meaning of that passage in Canticles
2:4, "He brought me to the banqueting-house: stay me with flagons, comfort
me with apples." And whosoever has tasted of this joy, can have no relish
for worldly pleasures. But as that proceeds from the true love of God,
arising from faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, it follows, that if we desire
to obtain so great a good, and, by tasting some drops of this sweetness,
to enjoy this earnest and foretaste of everlasting life, it must be
obtained by a lively faith, operating by divine love. Whence St. Paul
tells us that "the love of Christ passeth knowledge." Eph. 3:19.

4. And as this divine love is not a thing _without_ us, but _within_ us,
it follows that this does not depend upon our external goods or
possessions, such as riches, honors, learning, meat, or drink, or any
other outward blessing; but that all these things are contained _in it_.
And as this love shall attain its full perfection in the other life, so
the peace and joy that flow from it, shall be perfect and everlasting.
This treasure a man shall have in himself, and no one shall take it from
him; he shall have a river of living pleasure rising up in himself,
independent of all external blessings and comforts. And as no man knoweth
this treasure, but he that has it; so he that has it, is in perfect ease;
he envies nobody, covets nothing, thirsts after nothing but the fulness
and perfection of divine love.

5. The first fruits of this treasure may be possessed by faithful souls
even in this life, without lessening the reversion in the next life; yea,
it rather increases and spreads itself to infinite degrees, so that though
all mankind should unite together in this divine love, they would be no
hinderance to each other, but would rather increase and improve their
united stock of love and joy. For the more earnestly any man loves God,
the greater is his joy. And if it be so in this world, how great shall our
joy be in the next, when God shall pour out the fulness of his joy and
love upon his elect, and He himself shall be "all in all." 1 Cor. 15:28.



Chapter XXXVII.


                     Of The Evil Fruits Of Self-Love.


    _Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: and let your laughter be
    turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness._--JAMES 4:9.


As true and divine joy proceeds from true and divine love, so nothing can
proceed from false love but false joy. For as self-love aims at nothing,
delights in nothing but honors, riches, and sensual and worldly pleasures,
all which are fading, perishing, and subject to a thousand casualties;
therefore the man whose heart is set upon them, cannot but be always
fearful, apprehensive, and jealous of every accident that may deprive him
of his happiness; so that his joys are never solid or lasting, but false
and perishing, mixed with fears and cares, and ending in disappointment
and sorrow. For as the seed is, such is the fruit.

2. Now we have already shown, that self-love is corrupt, impure, unjust,
abominable, and unnatural, the seed and root of all evil, the parent of
weakness, blindness, error, and death. And the fruit or joy arising from
it is of the same sort, unjust, impure, opposed to God, to our neighbor,
and to all righteousness; it rejoices in iniquity, and contempt of God.
And if it be a sin only to love anything which God hateth, how much more
grievous a sin must it be to delight and rejoice in it? Such a joy as
this, which is opposite to the nature of every creature, and contrary to
the nature and express will of God, cannot but end in everlasting sorrow,
death, and darkness.

3. For as divine joy brings us nearer and nearer to God; so carnal joy
carries us farther and farther from him. Divine joy makes us the friends
of God; but worldly joy makes us his enemies. The former confirms and
strengthens the will in the love of God, makes the conscience easy,
cheerful, and happy; the latter disquiets and torments the soul, making it
turbulent, restless, and uneasy. That may be obtained without labor or
charge; this requires both, and all too little to support and secure it.
The one produces, improves, and preserves love, peace, and friendship
among men; the other creates discord, contentions and quarrels, wars,
violence, and bloodshed. From the one all good, from the other all evil
things proceed. The one is a lively, salutary, and sober joy, full of
virtue, full of pleasure, and acceptable to God; the other is fleshly,
vicious, dishonest, base, and hated of God. The one increases our devout
longings after God and goodness; the other inflames our corrupt desires.
That enlightens the understanding, filling it with divine light and
wisdom; this darkens and blinds it, and fills it with ignorance and error.
That is true and substantial; this treacherous, deceitful, and false.



Chapter XXXVIII.


    Everlasting Sorrow And Death, The End Of Self-Love And Carnal Joy.


    _If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die._--ROM. 8:13.


As we have already shown everlasting joy to be the genuine fruit of divine
love; it follows, that without that love, we cannot be partakers of the
joy, but must sit down at the last in eternal anguish and distress. For
when the condemned sinner comes to reflect and consider, that by his own
fault, he has irrecoverably lost all the blessings of a happy eternity,
how great must his sorrow, how bitter must his grief be! Annihilation
itself would be to him a blessing; but alas! he wishes for it in vain, he
must bear his burden, and undergo his punishment to all eternity.

2. This must raise in him an eternal hatred and abhorrence of himself, and
all his adherent impurities and sin; which, whether he will or not, will
forever stare him in the face, revenging, as it were, upon him the past
sacrilege of his self-love.



Chapter XXXIX.


         All That We Have Must Be Offered And Consecrated To God.


    _O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord
    our maker._--PS. 95:6.


As we are assured that God is our Creator, Preserver, and loving Father,
to whom can we more reasonably pay our honor, duty, and service, than to
him? Whom shall we rather implore and pray to, whom shall we rather praise
and glorify, than him that made us? Whom shall we rather trust? In whom
shall we rather hope? Whom shall we rather love? In whom shall we rather
rejoice and be happy? Shall we not love him, who hath created us in his
own image? Shall we not honor him, who has exalted us above all creatures?
Shall we not devote ourselves entirely to him, who has given himself
entirely unto us? Who created us for the end that we might live, abide,
and rejoice with him forever? Shall we not love and honor him, who has
adopted us for his children?

2. Think, therefore, and consider with thyself, O man! that as God has
given thee a rational soul, so thou oughtest to consecrate all the powers
and faculties of it to his honor and service. He has given thee the
faculty of loving: therefore love him; he has given thee understanding:
endeavor to know him; he has given thee fear: therefore fear him; the
power of honoring: therefore honor him; the gift of prayer: therefore pray
to him; of praise and thanksgiving: therefore praise his name. He has
given thee the power of believing, hoping, and trusting: therefore depend,
and trust, and hope in him; of rejoicing: therefore rejoice and be glad in
him. Lastly, as all things are in him, and he has an infinite power of
doing all things, consider this with thyself, that if thou rest and
rejoice in him alone, thou shalt in him possess all things.

3. And hence arises the true and genuine worship of God. He that loves
him, honors him; he that loves him not, affronts him. So likewise he that
fears him, honors him; he that fears not, despises him. And all the other
vices and virtues are of the same nature. By obedience, God is honored,
and he is dishonored by disobedience; the same may be said of faith, hope,
charity, and gratitude.

4. From all this it appears, that there is nothing better, more honorable,
or more profitable for man, than to honor God; and nothing more base and
abominable than to dishonor him.



Chapter XL.


      He Can Never Praise And Glorify God, Who Seeks His Own Glory.


    _Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give
    glory._--PS. 115:1.


He that in all things seeks not the glory of God, and endeavors to promote
it, does not act like a creature of God, but directly opposes his Maker,
and all his designs, seeing he made all things for his own glory. And he
does even worse, who measures all things no otherwise than as they
contribute to the raising of his own glory and honor. Such a one usurps
the honor due to God alone, and, like the rebel Lucifer, sets himself in
God's throne.

2. And this he does not only in his own soul, but endeavors to lead others
into the same guilt, by filling their hearts, which ought to be thrones
and temples of God, with the same notions of love and honor to himself, as
he has entertained in his own mind; endeavoring as much as in him lies, to
dispossess his Maker and settle himself in his room. But what greater sin
can there be than this? Now as the consequence of this irregular loving
and honoring a man's self is, that it makes him the enemy of God, and
casts him out of his presence into the pit of destruction, it follows,
that he who would be the friend of God, must hate and deny himself.

3. Return, therefore, and repent, O man! believe in Christ and live in him
as a new creature, and he will receive thee and comfort thee. But to
others, who persist in their rebellion and continue in their corruptions,
he shall say at the last day: "I never knew you: depart from me, ye that
work iniquity!" Matt. 7:23. Moreover, as the love of Christ is our chief
good, our highest wisdom, and the perfection of our knowledge, and
self-love is perfectly opposite to it: let us be persuaded to cast out the
love of ourselves and of the world, that the love of Christ may enter into
our hearts. This is that love which perfects and accomplishes our
Christianity, and with this do thou, O God, refresh and satisfy our souls
for ever and ever. Amen.



Conclusion.


1. The title "True Christianity" is prefixed to these Four Books for the
reason that true faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, and the righteousness
which proceeds from faith, constitute the fountain from which the whole
Christian life must flow. I have, accordingly, written, not for heathens,
but for Christians; who have, it is true, adopted the Christian faith, but
whose life does not accord with it, and who deny, or will not understand,
the power of faith. 2 Tim. 3:5. I have written, not for unbelievers, but
for believers; not for those who are yet to be justified, but for those
who are already justified. Hence, this whole work on daily repentance and
Christian love, ought to be understood in no other sense, than that faith
must go before as a light in our path, and that it is the foundation of
all. Let no one, by any means, suppose that anything is here ascribed to
our carnal free will or to good works; our sole object is to persuade you,
as you are a Christian, and are anointed with the Spirit of God, to let
Christ live in you, and rule in you, and to let the Holy Spirit govern
you, in order that your Christianity may not be hypocrisy.

2. Hence, too, Part II. of this Fourth Book is not to be so understood, as
if we could love God from our own carnal will; for love is a fruit of the
Holy Spirit. This Part II. is, on the contrary, only intended to show
that, besides the Word of God, the Holy Scriptures, even our own heart and
conscience may teach us, from the book of nature, and the light of nature,
that we are bound to love God on account of his great love bestowed upon
us, and manifested through the means of all his creatures. Such an
argument, derived from nature, ought to convince every man, whether he be
a heathen or a Christian, a believer or an unbeliever; and no one can
refute it. For, granting that God has bestowed so many mercies on us, who
can deny that we are in gratitude obliged to so gracious a benefactor? And
as he calls and invites us to love him, by all the creatures which are
bestowed in common upon all mankind, who can deny that the love of God is
discovered to us in the book of nature, and that the heathens themselves
may be convinced by arguments drawn thence? "The works of the Lord are
great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein." Ps. 111:2. And,
"Thou Lord, hast made me glad through thy work; I will triumph in the
works of thy hands." Ps. 92:4. How can these works be more effectually
praised, than in this manner? The Lord God give us understanding and
wisdom, that we may know him and praise him for all his works, both here
and forevermore. Amen.
