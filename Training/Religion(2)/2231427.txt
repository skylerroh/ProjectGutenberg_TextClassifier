
Is a musician made by his teacher? He makes him-
self a musician by practising what he was taught. The
conscientious are successful. They follow faithfully; [20]
through evil or through good report, they work on to the
achievement of good; by patience, they inherit the prom-
ise. Be active, and, however slow, thy success is sure:
toil is triumph; and--thou hast been faithful over a few
things. [25]

The lives of great men and women are miracles of pa-
tience and perseverance. Every luminary in the constel-
lation of human greatness, like the stars, comes out in
the darkness to shine with the reflected light of God.

Material philosophy, human ethics, scholastic theology, [30]
and physics have not sufficiently enlightened mankind.
Human wrong, sickness, sin, and death still appear in

[Page 341.]

mortal belief, and they never bring out the right action [1]
of mind or body. When will the whole human race have
one God,--an undivided affection that leaves the unreal
material basis of things, for the spiritual foundation and
superstructure that is real, right, and eternal? [5]

First purify thought, then put thought into words,
and words into deeds; and after much slipping and
clambering, you will go up the scale of Science to the
second rule, and be made ruler over many things. Fidelity
finds its reward and its strength in exalted purpose. Seek- [10]
ing is not sufficient whereby to arrive at the results of
Science: you must strive; and the glory of the strife
comes of honesty and humility.

Do human hopes deceive? is joy a trembler? Then,
weary pilgrim, unloose the latchet of thy sandals; for the [15]
place whereon thou standest is sacred. By that, you may
know you are parting with a material sense of life and
happiness to win the spiritual sense of good. O learn to
lose with God! and you find Life eternal: you gain all.
To doubt this is implicit treason to divine decree. [20]

The parable of "the ten virgins" serves to illustrate
the evil of inaction and delay. This parable is drawn
from the sad history of Vesta,--a little girl of eight
years, who takes the most solemn vow of celibacy for thirty
years, and is subject to terrible torture if the lamp she [25]
tends is not replenished with oil day and night, so that the
flame never expires. The moral of the parable is pointed,
and the diction purely Oriental.

We learn from this parable that neither the cares of
this world nor the so-called pleasures or pains of mate- [30]
rial sense are adequate to plead for the neglect of spiritual
light, that must be tended to keep aglow the flame of

[Page 342.]

devotion whereby to enter into the joy of divine Science [1]
demonstrated.

The foolish virgins had no oil in their lamps: their
way was material; thus they were in doubt and dark-
ness. They heeded not their sloth, their fading warmth [5]
of action; hence the steady decline of spiritual light,
until, the midnight gloom upon them, they must borrow
the better-tended lamps of the faithful. By entering
the guest-chamber of Truth, and beholding the bridal
of Life and Love, they would be wedded to a higher [10]
understanding of God. Each moment's fair expect-
ancy was to behold the bridegroom, the One "altogether
lovely."

It was midnight: darkness profound brooded over
earth's lazy sleepers. With no oil in their lamps, no [15]
spiritual illumination to look upon him whom they had
pierced, they heard the shout, "The bridegroom cometh!"
But how could they behold him? Hear that human
cry: "Oh, lend us your oil! our lamps have gone out,--
no light! earth's fables flee, and heaven is afar [20]
off."

The door is shut. The wise virgins had no oil to spare,
and they said to the foolish, "Go to them that sell, and
buy for yourselves." Seek Truth, and pursue it. It should
cost you something: you are willing to pay for error [25]
and receive nothing in return; but if you pay the price of
Truth, you shall receive _all_.

"The children of this world are in their generation
wiser than the children of light;" they watch the market,
acquaint themselves with the etiquette of the exchange, [30]
and are ready for the next move. How much more should
we be faithful over the few things of Spirit, that are able

[Page 343.]

to make us wise unto salvation! Let us watch and pray [1]
that we enter not into the temptation of ease in sin; and
let us not forget that others before us have laid upon the
altar all that we have to sacrifice, and have passed to
their reward. Too soon we cannot turn from disease [5]
in the body to find disease in the mortal mind, and its cure,
in working for God. Thought must be made better, and
human life more fruitful, for the divine energy to move
it onward and upward.

Warmed by the sunshine of Truth, watered by the [10]
heavenly dews of Love, the fruits of Christian Science
spring upward, and away from the sordid soil of self and
matter. Are we clearing the gardens of thought by up-
rooting the noxious weeds of passion, malice, envy, and
strife? Are we picking away the cold, hard pebbles of [15]
selfishness, uncovering the secrets of sin and burnishing
anew the hidden gems of Love, that their pure perfection
shall appear? Are we feeling the vernal freshness and
sunshine of enlightened faith?

The weeds of mortal mind are not always destroyed [20]
by the first uprooting; they reappear, like devastating
witch-grass, to choke the coming clover. O stupid gar-
dener! watch their reappearing, and tear them away from
their native soil, until no seedling be left to propagate--
and rot.

Among the manifold soft chimes that will fill the haunted [25]
chambers of memory, this is the sweetest: "Thou hast
been faithful!"

[Page 344.]




True Philosophy And Communion


It is related of Justin Martyr that, hearing of a Pythag- [2]
orean professor of ethics, he expressed the wish to be-
come one of his disciples. "Very well," the teacher
replied; "but have you studied music, astronomy, and [5]
geometry, and do you think it possible for you to under-
stand aught of that which leads to bliss, without hav-
ing mastered the sciences that disengage the soul from
objects of sense, so rendering it a fit habitation for
the intelligences?" On Justin's confessing that he had [10]
not studied those branches, he was dismissed by the
professor.

Alas for such a material science of life! Of what
avail would geometry be to a poor sinner struggling with
temptation, or to a man with the smallpox? [15]

Ancient and modern philosophies are spoiled by lack
of Science. They would place Soul wholly inside of body,
intelligence in matter; and from error of premise would
seek a correct conclusion. Such philosophy can never
demonstrate the Science of Life,--the Science which [20]
Paul understood when he spoke of willingness "to be
absent from the body, and present with the Lord." Such
philosophy is far from the rules of the mighty Nazarene
Prophet. His words, living in our hearts, were these:
"Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as [25]
a little child, shall in no wise enter therein." Not through
astronomy did he point out the way to heaven and the
reign of harmony.

We need the spirit of St. Paul, when he stood on Mars'
hill at Athens, bringing Christianity for the first time [30]

[Page 345.]

into Europe. The Spirit bestows spiritual gifts, God's [1]
presence and providence. St. Paul stood where Socrates
had stood four hundred years before, defending himself
against the charge of atheism; in the place where De-
mosthenes had pleaded for freedom in immortal strains [5]
of eloquence.

We need the spirit of the pious Polycarp, who, when
the proconsul said to him, "I will set the beasts upon
you, unless you yield your religion," replied: "Let them
come; I cannot change from good to bad." Then they [10]
bound him to the stake, set fire to the fagots, and his
pure and strong faith rose higher through the baptism
of flame.

Methinks the infidel was blind who said, "Christianity
is fit only for women and weak men;" but even infidels [15]
may disagree. Bonaparte declared, "Ever since the
reign of Christianity began the loftiest intellects have had
a practical faith in God." Daniel Webster said, "My
heart has always assured and reassured me that Chris-
tianity must be a divine reality." [20]

To turn the popular indignation against an advanced
form of religion, the pagan slanderers affirmed that
Christians took their infants to a place of worship in
order to offer them in sacrifice,--a baptism not of
water but of blood, thus distorting or misapprehending [25]
the purpose of Christian sacraments. Christians met
in midnight feasts in the early days, and talked of the
crucified Saviour; thence arose the rumor that it was
a part of Christian worship to kill and eat a human
being. [30]

Really, Christianity turned men away from the thought
of fleshly sacrifice, and directed them to spiritual attain-

[Page 346.]

ments. Life, not death, was and is the very centre of [1]
its faith. Christian Science carries this thought even
higher, and insists on the demonstration of moral and
spiritual healing as eminent proof that God is understood
and illustrated. [5]




Origin Of Evil


The origin of evil is the problem of ages. It confronts
each generation anew. It confronts Christian Science.
The question is often asked, If God created only the
good, whence comes the evil? [10]

To this question Christian Science replies: Evil never
did exist as an entity. It is but a belief that there is an
opposite intelligence to God. This belief is a species of
idolatry, and is not more true or real than that an image
graven on wood or stone is God. [15]

The mortal admission of the reality of evil perpetuates
faith in evil; and the Scriptures declare that "to whom
ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye
are." This leading, self-evident proposition of Christian
Science, that, good being real, its opposite is necessarily [20]
unreal, needs to be grasped in all its divine requirements.




Truth Versus Error


"A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures
of silver." It is a rule in Christian Science never to re-
peat error unless it becomes requisite to bring out Truth. [25]
Then lift the curtain, let in the light, and countermand

[Page 347.]

this first command of Solomon, "Answer not a fool accord- [1]
ing to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him,"

A distant rumbling and quivering of the earth foretell
the internal action of pent-up gas. To avoid danger from
this source people have to escape from their houses to the [5]
open space. A conical cloud, hanging like a horoscope
in the air, foreshadows a cyclone. To escape from this
calamity people prepare shelter in caves of the earth.

They who discern the face of the skies cannot always
discern the mental signs of these times, and peer through [10]
the opaque error. Where my vision begins and is clear,
theirs grows indistinct and ends.

There are diversities of operation by the same spirit.
Two individuals, with all the goodness of generous na-
tures, advise me. One says, Go this way; the other [15]
says, Take the opposite direction! Between the two I
stand still; or, accepting the premonition of one of them,
I follow his counsel, take a few steps, then halt. A true
sense not unfamiliar has been awakened. I see the way
now. The guardians of His presence go before me. I [20]
enter the path. It may be smooth, or it may be rugged;
but it is always straight and narrow; and if it be up-
hill all the way, the ascent is easy and the summit can
be gained.

God is responsible for the mission of those whom He [25]
has anointed. Those who know no will but His take
His hand, and from the night He leads to light. None
can say unto Him, What doest Thou?

_The Christian Science Journal_ was the oldest and
only authenticated organ of Christian Science up to [30]
1898. Loyal Scientists are targets for envy, rivalry,
slander; and whoever hits this mark is well paid by the

[Page 348.]

umpire. But the Scientists aim highest. They press for- [1]
ward towards the mark of a high calling. They recog-
nize the claims of the law and the gospel. They know
that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he reap. They
infringe neither the books nor the business of others; and [5]
with hearts overflowing with love for God, they help on the
brotherhood of men. It is not _mine_ but _Thine_ they seek.

When God bids one uncover iniquity, in order to
exterminate it, one should lay it bare; and divine Love
will bless this endeavor and those whom it reaches. [10]
"Nothing is hid that shall not be revealed."

It is only a question of time when God shall reveal His
rod, and show the plan of battle. Error, left to itself,
accumulates. Hence, Solomon's transverse command:
"Answer a fool according, to his folly, lest he be wise in [15]
his own conceit."

To quench the growing flames of falsehood, once in
about seven years I have to repeat this,--that I use no
drugs whatever, not even coffea (coffee), thea (tea), cap-
sicum (red pepper); though every day, and especially at [20]
dinner, I indulge in homoeopathic doses of _Natrum muri-_
_aticum_ (common salt).

When I found myself under this new _regime_ of medi-
cine, the medicine of Mind, I wanted to satisfy my curi-
osity as to the effect of drugs on one who had lost all [25]
faith in them. Hence I tried several doses of medicine,
and so proved to myself that drugs have no beneficial
effect on an individual in a proper state of mind.

I have by no means encouraged students of the Massa-
chusetts Metaphysical College to enter medical schools, [30]
and afterwards denied this and objected to their entering
those schools. A student who consulted me on this sub-

[Page 349.]

ject, received my consent and even the offer of pecuniary [1]
assistance to take lessons outside of my College, provided
he received these lessons of a certain regular-school physi-
cian, whose instructions included about twelve lessons,
three weeks' time, and the surgical part of midwifery. I [5]
have students with the degree of M. D., who are skilful
obstetricians. Such a course with such a teacher would
not necessitate essential materialization of a student's
thought, nor detract from the metaphysical mode of
obstetrics taught in my College. [10]

This student had taken the above-named course in
obstetrics when he consulted me on the feasibility of enter-
ing a medical school; and to this I objected on the ground
that it was inconsistent with Christian Science, which he
claimed to be practising; but I was willing, and said [15]
so, that, notwithstanding my objection, he should do as
he deemed best, for I claim no jurisdiction over any stu-
dents. He entered the medical school, and several other
students with him. My counsel to all of them was in
substance the same as the foregoing, and some of these [20]
students have openly acknowledged this.

In answer to a question on the following subject, I
will state that I preached four years, and built up the
church, before I would accept the slightest remuneration.
When the church had sufficient members and means to [25]
pay a salary, and refused to give me up or to receive my
gratuitous services, I accepted, for a time, fifteen dollars
each Sunday when I preached. I never received more
than this; and the contributions, when I preached,
doubled that amount. I have accepted no pay from my [30]
church for about three years, and believe that I have
put into the church-fund about two thousand dollars of

[Page 350.]

my own contributions. I hold receipts for $1,489.50 paid [1]
in, and the balance was never receipted for.

I temporarily organized a secret society known as the
P. M., the workings whereof were not "terrible and too
shocking to relate." By and with advice of the very [5]
student who brings up the question of this society, it
was formed. The P. M. (Private Meeting) Society met
only twice. The first subject given out for considera-
tion was this: "There is no Animal Magnetism." There
was no advice given, no mental work, and there were [10]
no transactions at those meetings which I would hesitate
to have known. On the contrary, our deliberations
were, as usual, Christian, and like my public instruction.
The second P. M. convened in about one week from the
first. The subject given out at that meeting was, in sub- [15]
stance, "God is All; there is none beside Him." This
proved to be our last meeting. I dissolved the society,
and we have not met since. If harm could come from
the consideration of these two topics, it was because of
the misconception of those subjects in the mind that [20]
handled them. An individual state of mind sometimes
occasions effects on patients which are not in harmony
with Science and the soundness of the argument used.
Hence it prevents the normal action, and the benefit that would otherwise
            accrue. [25]

I issue no arguments, and cause none to be used in
mental practice, which consign people to suffering. On
the contrary, I cannot serve two masters; therefore I
teach the use of such arguments only as promote health
and spiritual growth. My life, consecrated to humanity [30]
through nameless suffering and sacrifice, furnishes its
own proof of my practice.

[Page 351.]

I have sometimes called on students to test their ability [1]
and meet the mental malpractice, so as to lift the burdens
imposed by students.

The fact is, that for want of time, and for the purpose
of blessing even my enemies, I neglect myself. I never [5]
have practised by arguments which, perverted, are the
weapons of the silent mental malpractice. I have no skill
in occultism; and I could not if I would, and would not
if I could, harm any one through the mental method of
Mind-healing, or in any manner. [10]

The late much-ado-about-nothing arose solely from
mental malicious practice, and the audible falsehood
designed to stir up strife between brethren, for the purpose
of placing Christian Science in the hands of aspirants
for place and power. These repeated attempts of mad [15]
ambition may retard our Cause, but they never can place
it in the wrong hands and hold it there, nor benefit
mankind by such endeavors.




Fallibility Of Human Concepts


Evil counterfeits good: it says, "I am Truth," though [20]
it is a lie; it says, "I am Love,"--but Love is spirit-
ual, and sensuous love is material, wherefore it is hate
instead of Love; for the five senses give to mortals pain,
sickness, sin, and death,--pleasure that is false, life that
leads unto death, joy that becomes sorrow. Love that is [25]
not the procurator of happiness, declares itself the anti-
pode of Love; and Love divine punishes the joys of this
false sense of love, chastens its affection, purifies it, and
turns it into the opposite channels.

Material life is the antipode of spiritual life; it mocks [30]

[Page 352.]

the bliss of spiritual being; it is bereft of permanence and [1]
peace.

When human sense is quickened to behold aright the
error,--the error of regarding Life, Truth, Love as
material and not spiritual, or as both material and spirit- [5]
ual,--it is able for the first time to discern the Science
of good. But it must first see the error of its present
erroneous course, to be able to behold the facts of Truth
outside of the error; and, _vice versa_, when it discovers
the truth, this uncovers the error and quickens the true [10]
consciousness of God, good. May the human shadows of
thought lengthen as they approach the light, until they
are lost in light and no night is there!

In Science, sickness is healed upon the same Principle
and by the same rule that sin is healed. To know the [15]
supposed bodily belief of the patient and what has claimed
to produce it, enables the practitioner to act more under-
standingly in destroying this belief. Thus it is in heal-
ing the moral sickness; the malicious mental operation
must be understood in order to enable one to destroy [20]
it and its effects. There is not sufficient spiritual power
in the human thought to heal the sick or the sinful.
Through the divine energies alone one must either get
out of himself and into God so far that his consciousness
is the reflection of the divine, or he must, through argu- [25]
ment and the human consciousness of both evil and good,
overcome evil.

The only difference between the healing of sin and the
healing of sickness is, that sin must be _un_covered before
it can be destroyed, and the moral sense be aroused to [30]
reject the sense of error; while sickness must be cov-
ered with the veil of harmony, and the consciousness be

[Page 353.]

allowed to rejoice in the sense that it has nothing to mourn [1]
over, but something to forget.

Human concepts run in extremes; they are like the
action of sickness, which is either an excess of action or
not action enough; they are fallible; they are neither [5]
standards nor models.

If one asks me, Is my concept of you right? I reply, The
human concept is always imperfect; relinquish your human
concept of me, or of any one, and find the divine, and you
have gained the right one--and never until then. People [10]
give me too much attention of the misguided, fallible sort,
and this misrepresents one through malice or ignorance.

My brother was a manufacturer; and one day a work-
man in his mills, a practical joker, set a man who applied
for work, in the overseer's absence, to pour a bucket of [15]
water every ten minutes on the regulator. When my
brother returned and saw it, he said to the jester, "You
must pay that man." Some people try to tend folks, as
if they should steer the regulator of mankind. God makes
_us_ pay for tending the action that He adjusts. [20]

The regulator is governed by the principle that makes
the machinery work rightly; and because it _is_ thus gov-
erned, the folly of tending it is no mere jest. The divine
Principle carries on His harmony.

Now turn from the metaphor of the mill to the Mother's [25]
four thousand children, most of whom, at about three
years of scientific age, set up housekeeping alone. Certain
students, being too much interested in themselves to think
of helping others, go their way. They do not love Mother,
but pretend to; they constantly go to her for help, interrupt [30]
the home-harmony, criticise and disobey her; then "return
to their vomit,"--world worship, pleasure seeking, and

[Page 354.]

sense indulgence,--meantime declaring they "never dis- [1]
obey Mother"! It exceeds my conception of human
nature. Sin in its very nature is marvellous! Who but a
moral idiot, sanguine of success in sin, can steal, and lie
and lie, and lead the innocent to doom? History needs it, [5]
and it has the grandeur of the loyal, self-forgetful, faith-
ful Christian Scientists to overbalance this foul stuff.

When the Mother's love can no longer promote peace
in the family, wisdom is not "justified of her children."
When depraved reason is preferred to revelation, error [10]
to Truth, and evil to good, and sense seams sounder than
Soul, the children are tending the regulator; they are
indeed losing the knowledge of the divine Principle and
rules of Christian Science, whose fruits prove the nature
of their source. A little more grace, a motive made pure, [15]
a few truths tenderly told, a heart softened, a character
subdued, a life consecrated, would restore the right action
of the mental mechanism, and make manifest the move-
ment of body and soul in accord with God.

Instead of relying on the Principle of all that really [20]
exists,--to govern His own creation,--self-conceit, igno-
rance, and pride would regulate God's action. Expe-
rience shows that humility is the first step in Christian
Science, wherein all is controlled, not by man or laws
material, but by wisdom, Truth, and Love. [25]


    Go gaze on the eagle, his eye on the sun,
    Fast gathering strength for a flight well begun,
    As rising he rests in a liberty higher
    Than genius inflated with worldly desire.

    No tear dims his eye, nor his pinions lose power [30]
    To gaze on the lark in her emerald bower--
    Whenever he soareth to fashion his nest,
    No vision more bright than the dream in his breast.


[Page 355.]




The Way


The present stage of progress in Christian Science pre- [2]
sents two opposite aspects,--a full-orbed promise, and
a gaunt want. The need, however, is not of the letter,
but the spirit. [5]

Less teaching and good healing is to-day the acme of
"well done;" a healing that is not guesswork,--chronic
recovery ebbing and flowing,--but instantaneous cure.
This absolute demonstration of Science must be revived.
To consummate this _desideratum_, mortal mind must pass [10]
through three stages of growth.

First, self-knowledge. The physician must know him-
self and understand the mental state of his patient. Error
found out is two-thirds destroyed, and the last third
pierces itself, for the remainder only stimulates and gives [15]
scope to higher demonstration. To strike out right and
left against the mist, never clears the vision; but to lift
your head above it, is a sovereign panacea. Mental dark-
ness is senseless error, neither intelligence nor power, and
its victim is responsible for its supposititious presence. [20]
"Cast the beam out of thine own eye." Learn what in
thine own mentality is unlike "the anointed," and cast
it out; then thou wilt discern the error in thy patient's
mind that makes his body sick, and remove it, and rest
like the dove from the deluge. [25]

"Physician, heal thyself." Let no clouds of sin gather
and fall in mist and showers from thine own mental
atmosphere. Hold thy gaze to the light, and the iris of
faith, more beautiful than the rainbow seen from my
window at the close of a balmy autumnal day, will span [30]
thy heavens of thought.

[Page 356.]

A radiant sunset, beautiful as blessings when they take [1]
their flight, dilates and kindles into rest. Thus will a
life corrected illumine its own atmosphere with spiritual
