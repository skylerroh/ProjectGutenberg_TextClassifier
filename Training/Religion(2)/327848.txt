
    O Lover of mankind,
      To Thee all glory be,
    For Thou didst give not death, but life,
      When hanging on the tree.

    When Lazarus rose at Christ's command,
      And God was glorified of men,
      The children cried Hosanna then,
    But Judas would not understand.

                            {Echos ho autos}

    When seated with Thy chosen band
      Thou didst to Thy disciples say
      That one, O Christ, would Thee betray,
    But Judas would not understand.

                               {ho autos}

    The sop revealed the traitor's hand,
      In answer to the question made;
      They saw by whom Thou wert betrayed,
    But Judas would not understand.

                               {ho autos}

    The Jews, O Christ, Thy life demand,
      'Twas purchased for a price like this--
      For silver pieces and a kiss,
    But Judas would not understand.

                               {ho autos}

    Thou, with Thine own unstained hand,
      Didst wash the feet, and humbly teach
      That such a task becometh each,
    But Judas would not understand.

                               {ho autos}

    'Watch thou and pray,' was Thy command,
      Lest, thoughtless, the disciples fall
      Beneath the tempter's bitter thrall;
    But Judas would not understand.

    The wily Judas watches near
      The Master's path to-day,
    That he may into wicked hands
      The Eternal Lord betray,
    Who in the desert lone and dread
    Supplied the multitudes with bread.

                                   II

    To-day the wicked one denies
      His Teacher and his Friend--
    Once a disciple, he betrays
      His Master in the end.
    For silver, see the Lord is sold,
    Who manna gave in days of old.

    To-day the Jews on Calvary
      A cruel Cross have raised,
    And nailed upon that Cross, their Lord
      Have wickedly abased,
    Who made a pathway through the sea
    And led them from captivity.

                                   IV

    To-day the spear is lifted high
      And thrust into His side,
    Who for His people raised His hand
      And wounded Egypt's pride;
    They give Him vinegar and gall,
    Who showered down manna on them all.

    O Thou who cloth'st Thyself complete
      With light as with a garment fair,
      Thou bor'st the cruel, vulgar stare,
    Unrobed before the judgment-seat.

                                   II

    Thou gav'st the hand its subtle power,
      But with the hand, O Lord of grace,
      Upon Thy pallid, careworn face,
    They smote Thee in that evil hour.

                                   III

    They nailed the Lord of Glory high,
      And while He hung in awful pain,
      The temple veil was rent in twain,
    The sun refused to see Him die.

    For all the good performed by Thee,
      O Christ, the Hebrews deemed it meet
      To bear Thee from the judgment-seat
    And nail Thee to the cruel tree;
      They gave Thee vinegar and gall--
      But render justice to them all.

                               {ho autos}

    'Twas not enough they should betray
      And nail Thee to the Cross to die;
      They wagged their heads and passed Thee by,
    And mocked Thee on that woful day;
      In vain they strove against Thee, Lord--
      Give Thou to them their due reward.

                               {ho autos}

    The quaking earth inspires no dread,--
      The temple veil asunder fell,
      The rocks were rent--still they rebel,
    E'en when the graves gave up their dead;
      But vain they strove against Thee, Lord--
      Give Thou to them their due reward.

                                    I

    When Thou wert crucified by men,
    O Christ, for Thy companion then
    Thou didst accept the base and vile,
    Whose hand was stained with blood the while;
    O, number us with him, we pray!
    Thou who art good and kind alway.

                                   II

                               {ho autos}

    Few were his words, but Thou didst hear;
    His faith was great, and Thou wert near;
    And first of men, with glad surprise,
    He entered opened Paradise.
    Be Thou for evermore adored!
    The needy's prayer was not abhorred.

    Our evening prayers attend,
      O Thou that holy art;
    In mercy full forgiveness send
      To every contrite heart;
    For Thou hast risen to set us free,
    And all mankind rejoice in Thee.

    Encompass Zion round,
      Ye people, tell His fame;
    Let Resurrection joy abound,
      And glory to His name;
    He is our Lord, who from the grave
    Arose our sinning souls to save.

      Ye people, come, adore,
    And worship Him with grateful praise
      Who lives for evermore;
    He is our God, who from the grave
    Arose our sinning souls to save.

                                   IV

    Lord, by Thy Passion Thou
      Sav'st men from passions base,
    And by Thy Resurrection, now
      Dost from corruption raise.
    Glory to Thee we humbly bring,
    O Christ, who art our Heavenly King.

    Now we see the sun descending,
      Now declines the evening light,
    And in hymns we praise the Father,
      Son and Spirit, God of Might.

    Worthy of unending praises,
      Christ the Son of God art Thou;
    For Thy gift of life eternal,
      See the world adores Thee now.

    We have heard the wondrous story
      Of the Resurrection morn;
    We have seen its matchless glory,
      Christ the risen Lord adorn.
          Let us worship and adore Him,
