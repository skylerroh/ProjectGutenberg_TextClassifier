because he was so stiff and sore. Then he hobbled up toward the doorway
to see if old Granny Fox had left any breakfast outside for him.

It was dark, very dark. Reddy was puzzled. Could it be that he had
gotten up before daylight--that he hadn't slept as long as he thought?
Perhaps he had slept the whole day through, and it was night again. My,
how hungry he was!

"I hope Granny has caught a fine, fat chicken for me," thought Reddy,
and his mouth watered.

Just then he ran bump into something. "Wow!" screamed Reddy Fox, and
clapped both hands to his nose. Something was sticking into it. It was
one of the sharp little spears that Prickly Porky hides in his coat.
Reddy Fox knew then why the old house was so dark. Prickly Porky was
blocking up the doorway.



CHAPTER XXVIII: Prickly Porky Enjoys Himself

   A boasting tongue, as sure as fate,
   Will trip its owner soon or late.
     --Old Granny Fox.

Prickly Porky the Porcupine was enjoying himself. There was no doubt
about that. He was stretched across the doorway of that old house, the
very house in which old Granny Fox had been born. When he had lain down
on the doorstep for a nap and sun-bath, he had thought that the old
house was still deserted. Then he had fallen asleep, only to be wakened
by Reddy Fox, who bad been asleep in the old house and who couldn't get
out because Prickly Porky was in the way.

Now Prickly Porky does not love Reddy Fox, and the more Reddy begged and
scolded and called him names, the more Prickly Porky chuckled. It was
such a good joke to think that he had trapped Reddy Fox, and he made up
his mind that he would keep Reddy in there a long time just to tease him
and make him uncomfortable. You see Prickly Porky remembered how often
Reddy Fox played mean tricks on little meadow and forest folks who are
smaller and weaker than himself.

"It will do him good. It certainly will do him good," said Prickly
Porky, and rattled the thousand little spears hidden in his long coat,
for he knew that the very sound of them would make Reddy Fox shiver with
fright.

Suddenly Prickly Porky pricked up his funny little short ears. He heard
the deep voice of Bowser the Hound, and it was coming nearer and nearer.
Prickly Porky chuckled again.

"I guess Mr. Bowser is going to have a surprise; I certainly think he
is," said Prickly Porky as he made all the thousand little spears stand
out from his long coat till he looked like a funny great chestnut burr.

Bowser the Hound did have a surprise. He was hunting Reddy Fox, and he
almost ran into Prickly Porky before he saw him. The very sight of those
thousand little spears sent little cold chills chasing each other down
Bowser's backbone clear to the tip of his tail, for he remembered how he
had gotten some of them in his lips and mouth once upon a time, and
how it had hurt to have them pulled out. Ever since then he had had the
greatest respect for Prickly Porky.

"Wow!" yelped Bowser the Hound, stopping short. "I beg your pardon,
Prickly Porky, I beg your pardon, I didn't know you were taking a nap
here."

All the time Bowser the Hound was backing away as fast as he could. Then
he turned around, put his tail between his legs and actually ran away.

Slowly Prickly Porky unrolled, and his little eyes twinkled as he
watched Bowser the Hound run away.

 "Bowser's very big and strong;
   His voice is deep; his legs are long;
  His bark scares some almost to death.
   But as for me he wastes his breath;
  I just roll up and shake my spears
   And Bowser is the one who fears."

So said Prickly Porky, and laughed aloud. Just then he heard a light
footstep and turned to see who was coming. It was old Granny Fox. She
had seen Bowser run away, and now she was anxious to find out if Reddy
Fox were safe.

"Good morning," said Granny Fox, taking care not to come too near.

"Good morning," replied Prickly Porky, hiding a smile.

"I'm very tired and would like to go inside my house; had you just as
soon move?" asked Granny Fox.

"Oh!" exclaimed Prickly Porky, "is this your house? I thought you lived
over on the Green Meadows."

"I did, but I've moved. Please let me in," replied Granny Fox.

"Certainly, certainly. Don't mind me, Granny Fox. Step right over me,"
said Prickly Porky, and smiled once more, and at the same time rattled
his little spears.

Instead of stepping over him, Granny Fox backed away.



CHAPTER XXIX: The New Home In The Old Pasture

   Who keeps a watch upon his toes
   Need never fear he'll bump his nose.
     --Old Granny Fox.

Now there is nothing like being shut in alone in the dark to make one
think. A voice inside of Reddy began to whisper to him. "If you hadn't
tried to be smart and show off you wouldn't have brought all this
trouble on yourself and Old Granny Fox," said the voice.

"I know it," replied Reddy right out loud, forgetting that it was only a
small voice inside of him.

"What do you know?" asked Prickly Porky. He was still keeping Reddy in
and Granny out and he had overheard what Reddy said.

"It is none of your business!" snapped Reddy.

Reddy could hear Prickly Porky chuckle. Then Prickly Porky repeated as
if to himself in a queer cracked voice the following:

 "Rudeness never, never pays,
  Nor is there gain in saucy ways.
  It's always best to be polite
  And ne'er give way to ugly spite.
  If that's the way you feel inside
  You'd better all such feelings hide;
  For he must smile who hopes to win,
  And he who loses best will grin."

Reddy pretended that he hadn't heard. Prickly Porky continued to chuckle
for a while and finally Reddy fell asleep. When he awoke it was to find
that Prickly Porky had left and old Granny Fox had brought him something
to eat.

Just as soon as Reddy Fox was able to travel he and Granny had moved
to the Old Pasture. The Old Pasture is very different from the Green
Meadows or the Green Forest. Yes, indeed, it is very, very different.
Reddy Fox thought so. And Reddy didn't like the change,--not a bit. All
about were great rocks, and around and over them grew bushes and
young trees and bull-briars with long ugly thorns, and blackberry and
raspberry canes that seemed to have a million little hooked hands,
reaching to catch in and tear his red coat and to scratch his face and
hands. There were little open places where wild-eyed young cattle fed
on the short grass. They had made many little paths all crisscross among
the bushes, and when you tried to follow one of these paths you never
could tell where you were coming out.

No, Reddy Fox did not like the Old Pasture at all. There was no long,
soft green grass to lie down in. And it was lonesome up there. He missed
the little people of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest. There was
no one to bully and tease. And it was such a long, long way from Farmer
Brown's henyard that old Granny Fox wouldn't even try to bring him a fat
hen. At least, that's what she told Reddy.

The truth is, wise old Granny Fox knew that the very best thing she
could do was to stay away from Farmer Brown's for a long time. She knew
that Reddy couldn't go down there, because he was still too lame and
sore to travel such a long way, and she hoped that by the time Reddy
was well enough to go, he would have learned better than to do such
a foolish thing as to try to show off by stealing a chicken in broad
daylight, as he had when he brought all this trouble on them.

Down on the Green Meadows, the home of Granny and Reddy Fox had been on
a little knoll, which you know is a little low hill, right where they
could sit on their doorstep and look all over the Green Meadows. It had
been very, very beautiful down there. They had made lovely little paths
through the tall green meadow grass, and the buttercups and daisies had
grown close up to their very doorstep. But up here in the Old Pasture
Granny Fox had chosen the thickest clump of bushes and young trees she
could find, and in the middle was a great pile of rocks. Way in among
these rocks Granny Fox had dug their new house. It was right down under
the rocks. Even in the middle of the day jolly, round, red Mr. Sun could
hardly find it with a few of his long, bright beams. All the rest of the
time it was dark and gloomy there.

No, Reddy Fox didn't like his new home at all, but when he said so old
Granny Fox boxed his ears.

"It's your own fault that we've got to live here now," said she. "It's
the only place where we are safe. Farmer Brown's boy never will find
this home, and even if he did he couldn't dig into it as he did into our
old home on the Green Meadows. Here we are, and here we've got to stay,
all because a foolish little Fox thought himself smarter than anybody
else and tried to show off."

Reddy hung his head. "I don't care!" he said, which was very, very
foolish, because, you know, he did care a very great deal.

And here we will leave wise Old Granny Fox and Reddy, safe, even if
they do not like their new home. You see, Lightfoot the Deer is getting
jealous. He thinks there should be some books about the people of the
Green Forest, and that the first one should be about him. And because we
all love Lightfoot the Deer, the very next book is to bear his name.
