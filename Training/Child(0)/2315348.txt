The "Athenaeum" says:--"There is no more practical way of communicating
elementary information than that which has been adopted in this series.
When we see contained in 124 small pages (as in _Fast in the Ice_) such
information as a man of fair education should possess about icebergs,
northern lights, Esquimaux, musk-oxen, bears, walruses, &c., together
with all the ordinary incidents of an Arctic voyage woven into a clear
connected narrative, we must admit that a good work has been done, and
that the author deserves the gratitude of those for whom the books are
especially designed, and also of young people of all classes."
