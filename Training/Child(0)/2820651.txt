          name Maiden's Heart. You much pious. You buy
          beans. Pay good. Me wants one speckled shirt.
          Crowded Owl want one speckled shirt, too. You send
          two speckled shirts. You good Big Little Man. You

                             "MAIDEN'S HEART, Cheyenne Chief.

          "Written by me, James R. Chalott, this seventh day
          of March, 187-, at the dictation of the
          above-mentioned Maiden's Heart. He has requested
          me to add that he wants the speckles to be red,
          and as large as you can get them."

During the morning, most of our party met to bid each other good-bye.
Corny, Rectus and I were standing together, having our little winding-up
talk, when Rectus asked Corny if she had kept her gray bean, the
insignia of our society.

"To be sure I have," she said, pulling it out from under her cloak. "I
have it on this little chain which I wear around my neck. I've worn it
ever since I got it. And I see you each have kept yours on your
watch-guards."

"Yes," I said, "and they're the only things of the kind we saved from
the burning 'Tigris.' Going to keep yours?"

"Yes, indeed," said Corny, warmly.

"So shall I," said I.

"And I, too," said Rectus.

And then we shook hands, and parted.


THE END.

his last book together with several that have never appeared in serial
form. It is more fully and richly illustrated than any previous book
with his own inimitable drawings. There will be many full page

delightful marginal sketches characteristic of this artist's latest
works.

A vigorous story for boys dealing with one of the most romantic episodes

great achievement, is ably set forth.

American classic for young readers, the publishers have reduced the
price of the New Amsterdam edition from $2.50 to $1.50, retaining all of
Mr. Doggett's illustrations. No handsomer or more appropriate gift book
for boy or girl can be found than this story of life in Holland, the
vitality and popularity of which seem to increase year by year.

Mr. Hemstreet becomes in this charming young people's work the annalist
as well as the antiquary of the city of his affection. He recounts its
picturesque history with a most sympathetic pen. No New York boy or girl
can gain elsewhere so readily and pleasantly the familiarity with the
city they should know most about.

Pacific, together with descriptions of the Indian tribes of the region
makes fascinating material.

          Illustrated by H. C. Edwards. $1.00 net.=

Boy life in a New England village forty or fifty years ago has never
been portrayed more faithfully or more vividly than in this wholesome
tale of Lem Parker and his chums. Full of fun and adventure, the story
has that atmosphere of reality that makes the strongest appeal to boys.
