            "Washed your mittens!
            Oh, you're good kittens!
          But I smell a rat close by;
                Hush, hush! Mee-ow, mee-ow."
          "We smell a rat close by,
                Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow."

THE MOON

ELIZA LEE FOLLEN

        O look at the moon!
          She is shining up there;
        O mother, she looks
          Like a lamp in the air.

        Last week she was smaller,
          And shaped like a bow;
        But now she's grown bigger,
          And round as an O.

        Pretty moon, pretty moon,
          How you shine on the door,
        And make it all bright
          On my nursery floor!

        You shine on my playthings,
          And show me their place,
        And I love to look up
          At your pretty bright face.

        And there is a star
          Close by you, and maybe
        That small twinkling star
          Is your little baby.

RUNAWAY BROOK

ELIZA LEE FOLLEN

        "Stop, stop, pretty water!"
          Said Mary one day,
        To a frolicsome brook
          That was running away.

        "You run on so fast!
          I wish you would stay;
        My boat and my flowers
          You will carry away.

        "But I will run after:
          Mother says that I may;
        For I would know where
          You are running away."

        So Mary ran on;
          But I have heard say,
        That she never could find
          Where the brook ran away.

DING DONG! DING DONG!

ELIZA LEE FOLLEN

          Ding dong! ding dong!
          I'll sing you a song;
        'Tis about a little bird;
          He sat upon a tree,
          And he sang to me,
        And I never spoke a word.

          Ding dong! ding dong!
          I'll sing you a song;
        'Tis about a little mouse;
          He looked very cunning,
          As I saw him running
        About my father's house.

          Ding dong! ding dong!
          I'll sing you a song
        About my little kitty;
          She's speckled all over,
          And I know you'll love her,
        For she is very pretty.

        Mrs. Prentiss (1818-1878) was the author of
        _The Susy Books_, published from 1853 to 1856,
        forerunners of many series of such juvenile
        publications. The following poem has retained
        its hold on the affections of children.


THE LITTLE KITTY

ELIZABETH PRENTISS

        Once there was a little kitty
          Whiter than snow;
        In a barn she used to frolic,
          Long time ago.

        In the barn a little mousie
          Ran to and fro;
        For she heard the kitty coming,
          Long time ago.

        Two eyes had little kitty
          Black as a sloe;
        And they spied the little mousie,
          Long time ago.

        Four paws had little kitty,
          Paws soft as dough;
        And they caught the little mousie,
          Long time ago.

        Nine teeth had little kitty,
          All in a row;
        And they bit the little mousie,
          Long time ago.

        When the teeth bit little mousie,
          Little mouse cried, "Oh!"
        But she got away from kitty,
          Long time ago.

        Mrs. Hale (1788-1879), left a widow with five
        children to support, devoted herself to a
        literary career. She wrote fiction, edited the
        _Ladies' Magazine_ of Boston, afterward the
        _Ladies' Book_ of Philadelphia, compiled a book
        of poetical quotations, and biographies of
        celebrated women. Most of her work was
        ephemeral in character, and she lives for us in
        the one poem that follows. It is usually
        printed without the last stanza which is here
        restored. Younger children, as a rule, do not
        object to such moralizing.


MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB

SARA J. HALE

        Mary had a little lamb,
          Its fleece was white as snow,
        And everywhere that Mary went,
          The lamb was sure to go.

        He followed her to school one day,
          That was against the rule;
        It made the children laugh and play,
          To see a lamb at school.

        And so the Teacher turned him out,
          But still he lingered near,
        And waited patiently about,
          Till Mary did appear:

        And then he ran to her, and laid
          His head upon her arm,
        As if he said, "I'm not afraid,
          You'll save me from all harm."

        "What makes the lamb love Mary so?"
          The eager children cry--
        "Oh, Mary loves the lamb, you know,"
          The Teacher did reply.

        And you each gentle animal
          In confidence may bind,
        And make them follow at your will,
          If you are only kind.

        Theodore Tilton (1835-1907) was a very
        brilliant New York orator, poet, and
        journalist. His poetry, published in a complete
        volume in 1897, contains some really
        distinguished verse. He is largely known to the
        new generation, however, by some stanzas from
        the following poem, which are usually found in
        readers and poetic compilations for children.
        The entire poem is given here. Does our "Swat
        the fly" campaign of recent years negate the
        kindly attitude emphasized in the poem?


BABY BYE

THEODORE TILTON

        Baby bye,
        Here's a fly;
        Let us watch him, you and I.
            How he crawls
            Up the walls,
            Yet he never falls!
        I believe with six such legs
        You and I could walk on eggs.
            There he goes
            On his toes,
            Tickling baby's nose.

        Spots of red
        Dot his head;
        Rainbows on his back are spread;
            That small speck
            Is his neck;
            See him nod and beck.
        I can show you, if you choose,
        Where to look to find his shoes,--
            Three small pairs,
            Made of hairs;
            These he always wears.

        Black and brown
        Is his gown;
        He can wear it upside down;
            It is laced
            Round his waist;
            I admire his taste.
        Yet though tight his clothes are made
        He will lose them, I'm afraid,
            If to-night
            He gets sight
            Of the candle-light.

        In the sun
        Webs are spun;
        What if he gets into one?
            When it rains
            He complains
            On the window-panes.
        Tongue to talk have you and I;
        God has given the little fly
            No such things,
            So he sings
            With his buzzing wings.

        He can eat
        Bread and meat;
        There's his mouth between his feet.
            On his back
            Is a pack
            Like a pedler's sack.
        Does the baby understand?
        Then the fly shall kiss her hand;
            Put a crumb
            On her thumb,
            Maybe he will come.

        Catch him? No,
        Let him go,
        Never hurt an insect so;
            But no doubt
            He flies out
            Just to gad about.
        Now you see his wings of silk
        Drabbled in the baby's milk;
            Fie, oh fie,
            Foolish fly!
            How will he get dry?

        All wet flies
        Twist their thighs,
        Thus they wipe their head and eyes;
            Cats, you know,
            Wash just so,
            Then their whiskers grow.
        Flies have hair too short to comb,
        So they fly bareheaded home;
            But the gnat
            Wears a hat,
            Do you believe that?

        Flies can see
        More than we.
        So how bright their eyes must be!
            Little fly,
            Ope your eye;
            Spiders are near by.
        For a secret I can tell,--
        Spiders never use flies well.
            Then away!
            Do not stay.
            Little fly, good-day!

        Prominent among American writers who have
        contributed to the happiness of children is
        Lucy Larcom (1826-1893). One of a numerous
        family, she worked as a child in the Lowell
        mills, later taught school in Illinois, was one
        of the editors of _Our Young Folks_, and wrote
        a most fascinating autobiography called _A New
        England Girlhood_. Several of her poems are
        still used in schools. The one that follows is,
        perhaps, the most popular of these. It is
        semi-dramatic, and the three voices of the poem
        can be easily discovered. Miss Larcom's finest
        poem is the one entitled "Hannah Binding
        Shoes."


THE BROWN THRUSH

LUCY LARCOM

        There's a merry brown thrush sitting up in the tree,
        He's singing to me! He's singing to me!
        And what does he say, little girl, little boy?
        "Oh, the world's running over with joy!
         Don't you hear? Don't you see?
         Hush! Look! In my tree
        I'm as happy as happy can be!"

        And the brown thrush keeps singing, "A nest do you see,
        And five eggs hid by me in the juniper tree?
        Don't meddle! Don't touch! little girl, little boy,
        Or the world will lose some of its joy!
          Now I'm glad! Now I'm free!
          And I always shall be,
        If you never bring sorrow to me."

        So the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree,
        To you and to me, to you and to me.
        And he sings all the day, little girl, little boy,
        "Oh, the world's running over with joy!"
          But long it won't be,
          Don't you know? don't you see?
        Unless we are as good as can be.

        Mrs. Child (1802-1880) was the editor of the
        first monthly for children in the United
        States, the _Juvenile Miscellany_. She wrote
        and compiled several works for children, and
        her optimistic outlook has led someone to speak
        of her as the "Apostle of Cheer." She wrote a
        novel, _Hobomak_ (1821), which is still spoken
        of with respect, and she was a prominent figure
        in the anti-slavery agitation. The two poems
        following have held their own with children for
        reasons easily recognized.


THANKSGIVING DAY

LYDIA MARIA CHILD

        Over the river and through the wood,
          To grandfather's house we go;
            The horse knows the way
            To carry the sleigh
          Through the white and drifted snow.

        Over the river and through the wood--
          Oh, how the wind does blow!
            It stings the toes
            And bites the nose,
          As over the ground we go.

        Over the river and through the wood,
          To have a first-rate play.
            Hear the bells ring,
            "Ting-a-ling-ding!"
          Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day!

        Over the river and through the wood,
          Trot fast, my dapple-gray!
            Spring over the ground,
            Like a hunting-hound!
          For this is Thanksgiving Day.

        Over the river and through the wood,
          And straight through the barnyard gate.
            We seem to go
            Extremely slow,
          It is so hard to wait!

        Over the river and through the wood--
          Now grandmother's cap I spy!
            Hurrah for the fun!
            Is the pudding done?
          Hurrah for pumpkin-pie!

WHO STOLE THE BIRD'S NEST?

LYDIA MARIA CHILD

        "To-whit! to-whit! to-whee!
        Will you listen to me?
        Who stole four eggs I laid,
        And the nice nest I made?"

        "Not I," said the cow, "Moo-oo!
        Such a thing I'd never do.
        I gave you a wisp of hay,
        But didn't take your nest away.
        Not I," said the cow, "Moo-oo!
        Such a thing I'd never do."

        "To-whit! to-whit! to-whee!
        Will you listen to me?
        Who stole four eggs I laid,
        And the nice nest I made?"

        "Bob-o'-link! Bob-o'-link!
        Now what do you think?
        Who stole a nest away
        From the plum-tree, to-day?"

        "Not I," said the dog, "Bow-wow!
        I wouldn't be so mean, anyhow!
        I gave the hairs the nest to make,
        But the nest I did not take.
        Not I," said the dog, "Bow-wow!
        I'm not so mean, anyhow."

        "To-whit! to-whit! to-whee!
        Will you listen to me?
        Who stole four eggs I laid,
        And the nice nest I made?"

        "Bob-o'-link! Bob-o'-link!
        Now what do you think?
        Who stole a nest away
        From the plum-tree, to-day?"

        "Coo-coo! Coo-coo! Coo-coo!
        Let me speak a word, too!
        Who stole that pretty nest
        From little yellow-breast?"

        "Not I," said the sheep; "oh, no!
        I wouldn't treat a poor bird so.
        I gave wool the nest to line,
        But the nest was none of mine.
        Baa! Baa!" said the sheep; "oh, no,
        I wouldn't treat a poor bird so."

        "To-whit! to-whit! to-whee!
        Will you listen to me?
        Who stole four eggs I laid,
        And the nice nest I made?"

        "Bob-o'-link! Bob-o'-link!
        Now what do you think?
        Who stole a nest away
        From the plum-tree, to-day?"

        "Coo-coo! Coo-coo! Coo-coo!
        Let me speak a word, too!
        Who stole that pretty nest
        From little yellow-breast?"

        "Caw! Caw!" cried the crow;
        "I should like to know
        What thief took away
        A bird's nest to-day?"

        "Cluck! Cluck!" said the hen;
        "Don't ask me again,
        Why, I haven't a chick
        Would do such a trick.
        We all gave her a feather,
        And she wove them together.
        I'd scorn to intrude
        On her and her brood.
        Cluck! Cluck!" said the hen,
        "Don't ask me again."

        "Chirr-a-whirr! Chirr-a-whirr!
        All the birds make a stir!
        Let us find out his name,
        And all cry 'For shame!'"

        "I would not rob a bird,"
        Said little Mary Green;
        "I think I never heard
        Of anything so mean."

        "It is very cruel, too,"
        Said little Alice Neal;
        "I wonder if he knew
        How sad the bird would feel?"

        A little boy hung down his head,
        And went and hid behind the bed,
        For he stole that pretty nest
        From poor little yellow-breast;
        And he felt so full of shame,
        He didn't like to tell his name.

        "Susan Coolidge" was the pseudonym used
        by Sarah C. Woolsey (1845-1905). She
        wrote numerous tales and verses for young
        people, and her series of _Katy Books_ was
        widely known and enjoyed. The poem
        that follows is a very familiar one, and its
        treatment of its theme may be compared
        with that in Henry Ward Beecher's little
        prose apologue (No. 249).


HOW THE LEAVES CAME DOWN

"SUSAN COOLIDGE"

        I'll tell you how the leaves came down:
          The great Tree to his children said,
        "You're getting sleepy, Yellow and Brown,
          Yes, very sleepy, little Red;
          It is quite time to go to bed."

        "Ah!" begged each silly, pouting leaf,
          "Let us a little longer stay;
        Dear Father Tree, behold our grief!
          'Tis such a very pleasant day,
          We do not want to go away."

        So, just for one more merry day
          To the great Tree the leaflets clung,
        Frolicked and danced and had their way
          Upon the autumn breezes swung,
          Whispering all their sports among,

        "Perhaps the great Tree will forget
          And let us stay until the spring,
        If we all beg and coax and fret."
          But the great Tree did no such thing;
          He smiled to hear their whispering.

        "Come, children all, to bed," he cried;
          And ere the leaves could urge their prayer,
        He shook his head, and far and wide,
          Fluttering and rustling everywhere,
          Down sped the leaflets through the air.

        I saw them; on the ground they lay,
          Golden and red, a huddled swarm,
        Waiting till one from far away,
          White bedclothes heaped up on her arm,
          Should come to wrap them safe and warm.

        The great bare Tree looked down and smiled.
          "Good-night, dear little leaves," he said;
        And from below each sleepy child
          Replied, "Good-night," and murmured,
          "It is _so_ nice to go to bed."


        The poems for young readers produced by the
        sisters Alice Cary (1820-1871) and Phoebe Cary
        (1824-1871) constitute the most successful body
        of juvenile verse yet produced in this country.
        One of Alice Cary's poems, "An Order for a
        Picture," is of a very distinguished quality,
        but as its appeal is largely to mature readers,
        two of Phoebe Cary's poems of simpler quality
        are chosen for use here. The first of these
        marks, by means of three illustrations within
        the range of children's observation, a very
        common defect of child nature and is, by the
        force of these illustrations, a good lesson in
        practical ethics. The appeal of the second is
        to that inherent ideal of disinterested heroism
        which is so strong in children. The setting of
        the story amidst the ever-present threat of the
        sea affords a good chance for the teacher to do
        effective work in emphasizing the geographical
        background. This should be done, however, not
        as geography merely, but with the attention on
        the human elements involved.

THEY DIDN'T THINK

PHOEBE CARY

        Once a trap was baited
          With a piece of cheese;
        Which tickled so a little mouse
          It almost made him sneeze;
        An old rat said, "There's danger,
          Be careful where you go!"
        "Nonsense!" said the other,
          "I don't think you know!"
        So he walked in boldly--
          Nobody in sight;
        First he took a nibble,
          Then he took a bite;
        Close the trap together
          Snapped as quick as wink,
        Catching mousey fast there,
          'Cause he didn't think.

        Once a little turkey,
          Fond of her own way,
        Wouldn't ask the old ones
          Where to go or stay;
        She said, "I'm not a baby,
          Here I am half-grown;
        Surely, I am big enough
          To run about alone!"
        Off she went, but somebody
          Hiding saw her pass;
        Soon like snow her feathers
          Covered all the grass.
        So she made a supper
          For a sly young mink,
        'Cause she was so headstrong
          That she wouldn't think.

        Once there was a robin
          Lived outside the door,
        Who wanted to go inside
          And hop upon the floor.
        "Ho, no," said the mother,
          "You must stay with me;
        Little birds are safest
          Sitting in a tree."
        "I don't care," said Robin,
          And gave his tail a fling,
        "I don't think the old folks
          Know quite everything."
        Down he flew, and Kitty seized him.
          Before he'd time to blink.
        "Oh," he cried, "I'm sorry,
          But I didn't think."

        Now my little children,
          You who read this song,
        Don't you see what trouble
          Comes of thinking wrong?
        And can't you take a warning
          From their dreadful fate
        Who began their thinking
          When it was too late?
        Don't think there's always safety
          Where no danger shows,
        Don't suppose you know more
          Than anybody knows;
        But when you're warned of ruin,
          Pause upon the brink,
        And don't go under headlong,
          'Cause you didn't think.

THE LEAK IN THE DIKE

A Story of Holland

PHOEBE CARY

        The good dame looked from her cottage
          At the close of the pleasant day,
        And cheerily called to her little son
          Outside the door at play:
        "Come, Peter, come! I want you to go,
          While there is light to see,
        To the hut of the blind old man who lives
          Across the dike, for me;
        And take these cakes I made for him--
          They are hot and smoking yet;
        You have time enough to go and come
          Before the sun is set."

        Then the good-wife turned to her labor,
          Humming a simple song,
        And thought of her husband, working hard
          At the sluices all day long;
        And set the turf a-blazing,
          And brought the coarse black bread;
        That he might find a fire at night,
          And find the table spread.

        And Peter left the brother,
          With whom all day he had played,
        And the sister who had watched their sports
          In the willow's tender shade;
        And told them they'd see him back before
          They saw a star in sight,
        Though he wouldn't be afraid to go
          In the very darkest night!

        For he was a brave, bright fellow,
          With eye and conscience clear;
        He could do whatever a boy might do,
          And he had not learned to fear.
        Why, he wouldn't have robbed a bird's nest,
          Nor brought a stork to harm,
        Though never a law in Holland
          Had stood to stay his arm!

        And now, with his face all glowing,
          And eyes as bright as the day
        With the thoughts of his pleasant errand,
          He trudged along the way;
        And soon his joyous prattle
          Made glad a lonesome place--
        Alas! if only the blind old man
          Could have seen that happy face!
        Yet he somehow caught the brightness
          Which his voice and presence lent;
        And he felt the sunshine come and go
          As Peter came and went.

        And now, as the day was sinking,
          And the winds began to rise,
        The mother looked from her door again,
          Shading her anxious eyes;
        And saw the shadows deepen
          And birds to their homes come back,
        But never a sign of Peter
          Along the level track.
        But she said: "He will come at morning,
          So I need not fret or grieve--
        Though it isn't like my boy at all
          To stay without my leave."

        But where was the child delaying?
          On the homeward way was he,
        And across the dike while the sun was up
          An hour above the sea.
        He was stopping now to gather flowers,
          Now listening to the sound,
        As the angry waters dashed themselves
          Against their narrow bound.

        "Ah! well for us," said Peter,
          "That the gates are good and strong,
        And my father tends them carefully,
          Or they would not hold you long!
        You're a wicked sea," said Peter;
          "I know why you fret and chafe;
        You would like to spoil our lands and homes;
          But our sluices keep you safe!"

        But hark! Through the noise of waters
          Comes a low, clear, trickling sound;
        And the child's face pales with terror,
          And his blossoms drop to the ground.
        He is up the bank in a moment,
          And stealing through the sand,
        He sees a stream not yet so large
          As his slender, childish hand.

        '_Tis a leak in the dike!_ He is but a boy,
          Unused to fearful scenes;
        But, young as he is, he has learned to know
          The dreadful thing that means.
        _A leak in the dike!_ The stoutest heart
          Grows faint that cry to hear,
        And the bravest man in all the land
          Turns white with mortal fear.
        For he knows the smallest leak may grow
          To a flood in a single night;
        And he knows the strength of the cruel sea
          When loosed in its angry might.

        And the boy! He has seen the danger,
          And, shouting a wild alarm,
        He forces back the weight of the sea
          With the strength of his single arm!
        He listens for the joyful sound
          Of a footstep passing nigh;
        And lays his ear to the ground, to catch
          The answer to his cry.
        And he hears the rough winds blowing,
          And the waters rise and fall,
        But never an answer comes to him,
          Save the echo of his call.
        He sees no hope, no succor,
          His feeble voice is lost;
        Yet what shall he do but watch and wait,
          Though he perish at his post!

        So, faintly calling and crying
          Till the sun is under the sea;
        Crying and moaning till the stars
          Come out for company;
        He thinks of his brother and sister,
          Asleep in their safe warm bed;
        He thinks of his father and mother,
          Of himself as dying--and dead;
        And of how, when the night is over,
          They must come and find him at last:
        But he never thinks he can leave the place
          Where duty holds him fast.

        The good dame in the cottage
          Is up and astir with the light,
        For the thought of her little Peter
          Has been with her all night.
        And now she watches the pathway,
          As yester eve she had done;
        But what does she see so strange and black
          Against the rising sun?
        Her neighbors are bearing between them
          Something straight to her door;
        Her child is coming home, but not
          As he ever came before!

        "He is dead!" she cries; "my darling!"
          And the startled father hears,
        And comes and looks the way she looks,
          And fears the thing she fears:
        Till a glad shout from the bearers
          Thrills the stricken man and wife--
        "Give thanks, for your son has saved our land,
          And God has saved his life!"
        So, there in the morning sunshine
          They knelt about the boy;
        And every head was bared and bent
          In tearful, reverent joy.

        'Tis many a year since then; but still,
          When the sea roars like a flood,
        Their boys are taught what a boy can do
          Who is brave and true and good.
        For every man in that country
          Takes his son by the hand,
        And tells him of little Peter,
          Whose courage saved the land.

        They have many a valiant hero,
          Remembered through the years:
        But never one whose name so oft
          Is named with loving tears.
        And his deed shall be sung by the cradle,
          And told to the child on the knee,
        So long as the dikes of Holland
          Divide the land from the sea!

        The world's greatest writer of verse for
        children, Robert Louis Stevenson, was born in
        Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1850. After he was
        twenty-five years old he spent much of the rest
        of his short life traveling in search of
        health. From 1889 to the time of his death in
        1894 he resided in Samoa. The verses given here
        (Nos. 282-295) are taken from his famous book,
        _A Child's Garden of Verses_, which, says
        Professor Saintsbury, "is, perhaps, the most
        perfectly natural book of the kind. It was
        supplemented later by other poems for children;
        and some of his work outside this, culminating
        in the widely known epitaph

          Home is the sailor, home from sea,
          And the hunter home from the hill,

        has the rarely combined merits of simplicity,
        sincerity, music, and strength." One of the
        best of Stevenson's poems for children outside
        the _Child's Garden of Verses_ is the
        powerfully dramatic story called _Heather Ale_.
        In attempting to solve the secret of
        Stevenson's supremacy, Edmund Gosse calls
        attention to the "curiously candid and
        confidential attitude of mind" in these poems,
        to the "extraordinary clearness and precision
        with which the immature fancies of eager
        childhood" are reproduced, and particularly, to
        the fact that they give us "a transcript of
        that child-mind which we have all possessed and
        enjoyed, but of which no one, except Mr.
        Stevenson, seems to have carried away a
        photograph." It is this ability to hand on a
        photographic transcript of the child's way of
        seeing things that, according to Mr. Gosse,
        puts Stevenson in a class which contains only
        two other members, Hans Christian Andersen in
        nursery stories, and Juliana Horatia Ewing in
        the more realistic prose tale. Children find
        expressed in these poems their own active
        fancies. It has been objected to them that the
        child pictured there is a lonely child, but
        every child, like every mature person, has an
        inner world of dreams and experiences in which
        he delights now and then to dwell. The presence
        of the qualities mentioned put at least two of
        Stevenson's prose romances among the most
        splendid adventure stories for young people,
        _Treasure Island_ and _Kidnapped_. Perhaps no
        book is more popular among pupils of the
        seventh and eighth grades than the former. It
        has been called a "sublimated dime novel," that
        is, it has all the decidedly attractive
        features of the "dime novel" plus the fine art
        of story-telling which is always lacking in
        that sensational type of story.

WHOLE DUTY OF CHILDREN

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

        A child should always say what's true,
        And speak when he is spoken to,
        And behave mannerly at table;
        At least as far as he is able.



283


THE COW

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

        The friendly cow all red and white,
          I love with all my heart:
        She gives me cream with all her might,
          To eat with apple-tart.

        She wanders lowing here and there,
          And yet she cannot stray,
        All in the pleasant open air,
          The pleasant light of day;

        And blown by all the winds that pass
          And wet with all the showers,
        She walks among the meadow grass
          And eats the meadow flowers.



284


TIME TO RISE

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

        A birdie with a yellow bill
        Hopped upon the window-sill,
        Cocked his shining eye and said:
        "Ain't you 'shamed, you sleepy-head?"



285


RAIN

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

        The rain is raining all around,
          It falls on field and tree,
        It rains on the umbrellas here,
          And on the ships at sea.



286


A GOOD PLAY

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

        We built a ship upon the stairs
        All made of the back-bedroom chairs,
        And filled it full of sofa pillows
        To go a-sailing on the billows.

        We took a saw and several nails,
        And water in the nursery pails;
        And Tom said, "Let us also take
        An apple and a slice of cake;"--
        Which was enough for Tom and me
        To go a-sailing on, till tea.

        We sailed along for days and days,
        And had the very best of plays;
        But Tom fell out and hurt his knee,
        So there was no one left but me.



287


THE LAMPLIGHTER

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

        My tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky;
        It's time to take the window to see Leerie going by;
        For every night at tea-time and before you take your seat,
        With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street.

        Now Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea,
        And my papa's a banker and as rich as he can be;
        But I, when I am stronger and can choose what I'm to do,
        O Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the lamps with you!

        For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door,
        And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more;
        And O! before you hurry by with ladder and with light,
        O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him to-night!



288


THE LAND OF NOD

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

        From breakfast on through all the day
        At home among my friends I stay,
        But every night I go abroad
        Afar into the land of Nod.

        All by myself I have to go,
        With none to tell me what to do--
        All alone beside the streams
        And up the mountain sides of dreams.

        The strangest things are there for me,
        Both things to eat and things to see,
        And many frightening sights abroad,
        Till morning in the land of Nod.

        Try as I like to find the way,
        I never can get back by day,
        Nor can remember plain and clear
        The curious music that I hear.



289


THE LAND OF STORY-BOOKS

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

        At evening when the lamp is lit,
        Around the fire my parents sit;
        They sit at home and talk and sing,
        And do not play at anything.

        Now, with my little gun, I crawl
        All in the dark along the wall,
        And follow round the forest track
        Away behind the sofa back.

        There, in the night, where none can spy,
        All in my hunter's camp I lie,
        And play at books that I have read
        Till it is time to go to bed.

        These are the hills, these are the woods,
        These are my starry solitudes;
        And there the river by whose brink
        The roaring lion comes to drink.

        I see the others far away
        As if in firelit camp they lay,
        And I, like to an Indian scout,
        Around their party prowled about.

        So when my nurse comes in for me,
        Home I return across the sea,
        And go to bed with backward looks
        At my dear Land of Story-books.



290


MY BED IS A BOAT

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

        My bed is like a little boat;
          Nurse helps me in when I embark:
        She girds me in my sailor's coat
          And starts me in the dark.

        At night, I go on board and say
          Good-night to all my friends on shore;
        I shut my eyes and sail away
          And see and hear no more.

        And sometimes things to bed I take,
          As prudent sailors have to do;
        Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake,
          Perhaps a toy or two.

        All night across the dark we steer;
          But when the day returns at last,
        Safe in my room, beside the pier,
          I find my vessel fast.



291


MY SHADOW

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

        I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,
        And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.
        He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
        And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.

        The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow--
        Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
        For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,
        And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.

        He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,
        And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.
        He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;
        I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!

        One morning, very early, before the sun was up,
        I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;
        But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,
        Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.

THE SWING

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

        How do you like to go up in a swing,
          Up in the air so blue?
        Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing
          Ever a child can do!

        Up in the air and over the wall,
          Till I can see so wide,
        Rivers and trees and cattle and all
          Over the countryside--

        Till I look down on the garden green,
          Down on the roof so brown--
        Up in the air I go flying again,
          Up in the air and down!



293


WHERE GO THE BOATS?

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

        Dark brown is the river,
          Golden is the sand.
        It flows along forever
          With trees on either hand.

        Green leaves a-floating,
          Castles of the foam,
        Boats of mine a-boating--
          Where will all come home?

        On goes the river
          And out past the mill,
        Away down the valley,
          Away down the hill.

        Away down the river,
          A hundred miles or more,
        Other little children
          Shall bring my boats ashore.

THE WIND

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

        I saw you toss the kites on high
        And blow the birds about the sky;
        And all around I heard you pass,
        Like ladies' skirts across the grass--
          O wind, a-blowing all day long,
          O wind, that sings so loud a song!

        I saw the different things you did,
        But always you yourself you hid.
        I felt you push, I heard you call,
        I could not see yourself at all--
          O wind, a-blowing all day long,
          O wind, that sings so loud a song!

        O you that are so strong and cold,
        O blower, are you young or old?
        Are you a beast of field and tree,
        Or just a stronger child than me?
          O wind, a-blowing all day long,
          O wind, that sings so loud a song!



295


WINDY NIGHTS

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

        Whenever the moon and stars are set,
          Whenever the wind is high,
        All night long in the dark and wet
          A man goes riding by.
        Late in the night when the fires are out,
        Why does he gallop and gallop about?

        Whenever the trees are crying aloud,
          And ships are tossed at sea,
        By, on the highway, low and loud,
          By at the gallop goes he.
        By at the gallop he goes, and then
        By he comes back at the gallop again.

SPINNING TOP

FRANK DEMPSTER SHERMAN

        When I spin round without a stop
        And keep my balance like the top,
        I find that soon the floor will swim
        Before my eyes; and then, like him,
        I lie all dizzy on the floor
        Until I feel like spinning more.

FLYING KITE

FRANK DEMPSTER SHERMAN

        I often sit and wish that I
        Could be a kite up in the sky,
        And ride upon the breeze, and go
        Whatever way it chanced to blow.
        Then I could look beyond the town,
        And see the river winding down,
        And follow all the ships that sail
        Like me before the merry gale,
        Until at last with them I came
        To some place with a foreign name.

KING BELL

FRANK DEMPSTER SHERMAN

        Long ago there lived a King
          A mighty man and bold,
        Who had two sons, named Dong and Ding,
          Of whom this tale is told.

        Prince Ding was clear of voice, and tall,
          A Prince in every line;
        Prince Dong, his voice was very small,
          And he but four feet nine.

        Now both these sons were very dear
          To Bell, the mighty King.
        They always hastened to appear
          When he for them would ring.

        Ding never failed the first to be,
          But Dong, he followed well,
        And at the second summons he
          Responded to King Bell.

        This promptness of each royal Prince
          Is all of them we know,
        Except that all their kindred since
          Have done exactly so.

        And if you chance to know a King
          Like this one of the dong,
        Just listen once--and there is Ding;
          Again--and there is Dong.

DAISIES

FRANK DEMPSTER SHERMAN

        At evening when I go to bed
        I see the stars shine overhead;
        They are the little daisies white
        That dot the meadows of the Night.

        And often while I'm dreaming so,
        Across the sky the Moon will go;
        It is a lady, sweet and fair,
        Who comes to gather daisies there.

        For, when at morning I arise,
        There's not a star left in the skies;
        She's picked them all and dropped them down
        Into the meadows of the town.

WYNKEN, BLYNKEN, AND NOD

EUGENE FIELD

        Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night
          Sailed off in a wooden shoe,--
        Sailed on a river of crystal light
          Into a sea of dew.
        "Where are you going, and what do you wish?"
          The old moon asked the three.
        "We have come to fish for the herring fish
          That live in this beautiful sea;
          Nets of silver and gold have we!"
              Said Wynken,
              Blynken,
              And Nod.

        The old moon laughed and sang a song,
          As they rocked in the wooden shoe;
        And the wind that sped them all night long
          Ruffled the waves of dew.
        The little stars were the herring fish
          That lived in that beautiful sea--
        "Now cast your nets wherever you wish,
          Never afeard are we!"
          So cried the stars to the fishermen three,
              Wynken,
              Blynken,
              And Nod.

        All night long their nets they threw
          To the stars in the twinkling foam,--
        Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe,
          Bringing the fishermen home:
        'Twas all so pretty a sail, it seemed
          As if it could not be;
        And some folk thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
          Of sailing that beautiful sea;
          But I shall name you the fishermen three:
              Wynken,
              Blynken,
              And Nod.

        Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,
          And Nod is a little head,
        And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
          Is a wee one's trundle-bed;
        So shut your eyes while Mother sings
          Of wonderful sights that be,
        And you shall see the beautiful things
          As you rock in the misty sea
          Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:--
               Wynken,
               Blynken,
               And Nod.

THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE

EUGENE FIELD

        Have you ever heard of the Sugar-Plum Tree?
          'Tis a marvel of great renown!
        It blooms on the shore of the Lollypop sea
          In the garden of Shut-Eye Town;
        The fruit that it bears is so wondrously sweet
          (As those who have tasted it say)
        That good little children have only to eat
          Of that fruit to be happy next day.

        When you've got to the tree, you would have a hard time
          To capture the fruit which I sing;
        The tree is so tall that no person could climb
          To the boughs where the sugar-plums swing!
        But up in that tree sits a chocolate cat,
          And a gingerbread dog prowls below--
        And this is the way you contrive to get at
          Those sugar-plums tempting you so:

        You say but the word to that gingerbread dog
          And he barks with such terrible zest
        That the chocolate cat is at once all agog,
          As her swelling proportions attest.
        And the chocolate cat goes cavorting around
          From this leafy limb unto that,
        And the sugar-plums tumble, of course, to the ground--
          Hurrah for that chocolate cat!

        There are marshmallows, gumdrops, and peppermint canes
          With stripings of scarlet or gold,
        And you carry away of the treasure that rains,
          As much as your apron can hold!
        So come, little child, cuddle closer to me
          In your dainty white nightcap and gown,
        And I'll rock you away to that Sugar-Plum Tree
          In the garden of Shut-Eye Town.

THE DUEL

EUGENE FIELD

        The gingham dog and the calico cat
        Side by side on the table sat;
        'Twas half past twelve, and (what do you think!)
        Nor one nor t'other had slept a wink!
          The old Dutch clock and the Chinese plate
          Appeared to know as sure as fate
        There was going to be a terrible spat.
          (_I wasn't there; I simply state
          What was told to me by the Chinese plate!_)

        The gingham dog went "Bow-wow-wow!"
        And the calico cat replied "Mee-ow!"
        The air was littered, an hour or so,
        With bits of gingham and calico,
          While the old Dutch clock in the chimney place
          Up with its hands before its face,
        For it always dreaded a family row!
          (_Now mind: I'm only telling you
          What the old Dutch clock declares is true!_)

        The Chinese plate looked very blue,
        And wailed, "Oh, dear! what shall we do!"
        But the gingham dog and the calico cat
        Wallowed this way and tumbled that,
          Employing every tooth and claw
          In the awfullest way you ever saw--
        And, oh! how the gingham and calico flew!
          (_Don't fancy I exaggerate--
          I got my news from the Chinese plate!_)

        Next morning, where the two had sat
        They found no trace of dog or cat:
        And some folks think unto this day
        That burglars stole that pair away!
          But the truth about the cat and pup
          Is this: they ate each other up!
        Now what do you really think of that!
          (_The old Dutch clock it told me so,
          And that is how I came to know._)

        James Whitcomb Riley was born in Greenfield,
        Indiana, in 1849, and died at Indianapolis in
        1916. His success was largely due to his
        ability to present homely phases of life in the
        Hoosier dialect. "The Raggedy Man" is a good
        illustration of this skill. In his prime Mr.
        Riley was an excellent oral interpreter of his
        own work, and his personifications of the
        Hoosier types in his poems in recitals all over
        the country had much to do with giving him an
        understanding body of readers. He had much of
        the power in which Stevenson was so
        supreme--that power of remembering accurately
        and giving full expression to the points of
        view of childhood. The perennial fascination of
        the circus as in "The Circus Day Parade"
        illustrates this particularly well. "The
        Treasures of the Wise Man" represents another
        class of Mr. Riley's poems in which he
        moralizes in a fashion that makes people
        willing to be preached at. It may be said very
        truly that most of his poems have their chief
        attraction in enabling older readers to recall
        the almost vanished thrilling delights of
        youth, but poems that do that are generally
        found to interest children also.


THE TREASURES OF THE WISE MAN[1]

JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY

      O the night was dark and the night was late,
      And the robbers came to rob him;
      And they picked the locks of his palace gate,
      The robbers that came to rob him--
      They picked the locks of his palace gate,
      Seized his jewels and gems of state,
      His coffers of gold and his priceless plate--
      The robbers that came to rob him.

      But loud laughed he in the morning red!--
      For of what had the robbers robbed him?--
      Ho! hidden safe, as he slept in bed,
      When the robbers came to rob him,--
      They robbed him not of a golden shred
      Of the childish dreams in his wise old head--
      "And they're welcome to all things else," he said,
      When the robbers came to rob him.

THE CIRCUS-DAY PARADE[1]

JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY

        Oh, the Circus-Day parade! How the bugles played and played!
        And how the glossy horses tossed their flossy manes, and neighed,
        As the rattle and the rhyme of the tenor-drummer's time
        Filled all the hungry hearts of us with melody sublime!

        How the grand band-wagon shone with a splendor all its own,
        And glittered with a glory that our dreams had never known!
        And how the boys behind, high and low of every kind,
        Marched in unconscious capture, with a rapture undefined!

        How the horsemen, two and two, with their plumes of white and blue,
        And crimson, gold and purple, nodding by at me and you,
        Waved the banners that they bore, as the Knights in days of yore,
        Till our glad eyes gleamed and glistened like the spangles that
            they wore!

        How the graceless-graceful stride of the elephant was eyed,
        And the capers of the little horse that cantered at his side!
        How the shambling camels, tame to the plaudits of their fame,
        With listless eyes came silent, masticating as they came.

        How the cages jolted past, with each wagon battened fast,
        And the mystery within it only hinted of at last
        From the little grated square in the rear, and nosing there
        The snout of some strange animal that sniffed the outer air!

        And, last of all, The Clown, making mirth for all the town,
        With his lips curved ever upward and his eyebrows ever down,
        And his chief attention paid to the little mule that played
        A tattoo on the dashboard with his heels, in the parade.

        Oh! the Circus-Day parade! How the bugles played and played!
        And how the glossy horses tossed their flossy manes and neighed,
        As the rattle and the rhyme of the tenor-drummer's time
        Filled all the hungry hearts of us with melody sublime!

THE RAGGEDY MAN[2]

JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY

        O The Raggedy Man! He works fer Pa;
        An' he's the goodest man ever you saw!
