        wealth, which he did not in the least covet....
        He was left a poor orphan in Ohio at seventeen
        years of age, and soon after heard of a rich
        uncle, who lived near Boston. He sets off on
        the long journey to Boston, finds his uncle, an
        eccentric old man, is hospitably received by
        him, but seeks employment in a humble way, and
        proves that he is a persevering and plucky
        young man."--_Boston Home Journal._


=The Kelp Gatherers=: A STORY OF THE MAINE COAST. By J. T. TROWBRIDGE.
Illustrated. $1.00.

        This book is full of interesting information
        upon the plant life of the seashore, and the
        life of marine animals; but it is also a bright
        and readable story, with all the hints of
        character and the vicissitudes of human life,
        in depicting which the author is an
        acknowledged master.


=The Scarlet Tanager=, AND OTHER BIPEDS. By J. T. TROWBRIDGE.
Illustrated. $1.00.

        Every new story which Mr. TROWBRIDGE begins is
        followed through successive chapters by
        thousands who have read and re-read many times
        his preceding tales. One of his greatest charms
        is his absolute truthfulness. He does not
        depict little saints, or incorrigible rascals,
        but just _boys_. This same fidelity to nature
        is seen in his latest book, "The Scarlet
        Tanager, and Other Bipeds." There is enough
        adventure in this tale to commend it to the
        liveliest reader, and all the lessons it
        teaches are wholesome.


=THE SILVER MEDAL STORIES. 6 volumes.=

=The Silver Medal=, AND OTHER STORIES. By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated.
$1.25.

        There were some schoolboys who had turned
        housebreakers, and among their plunder was a
        silver medal that had been given to one John
        Harrison by the Humane Society for rescuing
        from drowning a certain Benton Barry. Now
        Benton Barry was one of the wretched
        housebreakers. This is the summary of the
        opening chapter. The story is intensely
        interesting in its serious as well as its
        humorous parts.


=His Own Master.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

        "This is a book after the typical boy's own
        heart. Its hero is a plucky young fellow, who,
        seeing no chance for himself at home,
        determines to make his own way in the world....
        He sets out accordingly, trudges to the far
        West, and finds the road to fortune an
        unpleasantly rough one."--_Philadelphia
        Inquirer._

        "We class this as one of the best stories for
        boys we ever read. The tone is perfectly
        healthy, and the interest is kept up to the
        end."--_Boston Home Journal._


=Bound in Honor.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

        This story is of a lad, who, though not guilty
        of any bad action, had been an eye-witness of
        the conduct of his comrades, and felt "Bound in
        Honor" not to tell.

        "The glimpses we get of New England character
        are free from any distortion, and their
        humorous phases are always entertaining. Mr.
        TROWBRIDGE'S brilliant descriptive faculty is
        shown to great advantage in the opening chapter
        of the book by a vivid picture of a village
        fire, and is manifested elsewhere with equally
        telling effect."--_Boston Courier._


=The Pocket Rifle.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

        "A boy's story which will be read with avidity,
        as it ought to be, it is so brightly and
        frankly written, and with such evident
        knowledge of the temperaments and habits, the
        friendships and enmities of schoolboys."--_New
        York Mail._

        "This is a capital story for boys. TROWBRIDGE
        never tells a story poorly. It teaches honesty,
        integrity, and friendship, and how best they
        can be promoted. It shows the danger of hasty
        judgment and circumstantial evidence; that
        right-doing pays, and dishonesty
        never."--_Chicago Inter-Ocean._


=The Jolly Rover.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

        "This book will help to neutralize the ill
        effects of any poison which children may have
        swallowed in the way of sham-adventurous
        stories and wildly fictitious tales. 'The Jolly
        Rover' runs away from home, and meets life as
        it is, till he is glad enough to seek again his
        father's house. Mr. TROWBRIDGE has the power of
        making an instructive story absorbing in its
        interest, and of covering a moral so that it is
        easy to take."--_Christian Intelligencer._


=Young Joe=, AND OTHER BOYS. By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

        "Young Joe," who lived at Bass Cove, where he
        shot wild ducks, took some to town for sale,
        and attracted the attention of a portly
        gentleman fond of shooting. This gentleman went
        duck shooting with Joe, and their adventures
        were more amusing to the boy than to the
        amateur sportsman.

        There are thirteen other short stories in the
        book which will be sure to please the young
        folks.

=The Vagabonds:= AN ILLUSTRATED POEM. By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Cloth. $1.50.

"The Vagabonds" are a strolling fiddler and his dog. The fiddler has
been ruined by drink, and his monologue is one of the most pathetic and
effective pieces in our literature.



=THE TIDE-MILL STORIES. 6 volumes.=


=Phil and His Friends.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

        The hero is the son of a man who from drink got
        into debt, and, after having given a paper to a
        creditor authorizing him to keep the son as a
        security for his claim, ran away, leaving poor
        Phil a bond slave. The story involves a great
        many unexpected incidents, some of which are
        painful, and some comic. Phil manfully works
        for a year, cancelling his father's debt, and
        then escapes. The characters are strongly
        drawn, and the story is absorbingly
        interesting.


=The Tinkham Brothers' Tide-Mill.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated.
$1.25.

        "The Tinkham Brothers" were the devoted sons of
        an invalid mother. The story tells how they
        purchased a tide-mill, which afterwards, by the
        ill-will and obstinacy of neighbors, became a
        source of much trouble to them. It tells also
        how, by discretion and the exercise of a
        peaceable spirit, they at last overcame all
        difficulties.

        "Mr. TROWBRIDGE'S humor, his fidelity to
        nature, and story-telling power lose nothing
        with years; and he stands at the head of those
        who are furnishing a literature for the young,
        clean and sweet in tone, and always of interest
        and value."--_The Continent._


=The Satin-wood Box.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

        "Mr. TROWBRIDGE has always a purpose in his
        writings, and this time he has undertaken to
        show how very near an innocent boy can come to
        the guilty edge and yet be able by fortunate
        circumstances to rid himself of all suspicion
        of evil. There is something winsome about the
        hero; but he has a singular way of falling into
        bad luck, although the careful reader will
        never feel the least disposed to doubt his
        honesty.... It is the pain and perplexity which
        impart to the story its intense
        interest."--_Syracuse Standard._


=The Little Master.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

        This is the story of a schoolmaster, his
        trials, disappointments, and final victory. It
        will recall to many a man his experience in
        teaching pupils, and in managing their
        opinionated and self-willed parents. The story
        has the charm which is always found in Mr.
        TROWBRIDGE'S works.

        "Many a teacher could profit by reading of this
        plucky little schoolmaster."--_Journal of
        Education._


=His One Fault.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

        "As for the hero of this story, 'His One Fault'
        was absent-mindedness. He forgot to lock his
        uncle's stable door, and the horse was stolen.
        In seeking to recover the stolen horse, he
        unintentionally stole another. In trying to
        restore the wrong horse to his rightful owner,
        he was himself arrested. After no end of comic
        and dolorous adventures, he surmounted all his
        misfortunes by downright pluck and genuine good
        feeling. It is a noble contribution to juvenile
        literature."--_Woman's Journal._


=Peter Budstone.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

        "TROWBRIDGE'S other books have been admirable
        and deservedly popular, but this one, in our
        opinion, is the best yet. It is a story at once
        spirited and touching, with a certain dramatic
        and artistic quality that appeals to the
        literary sense as well as to the story-loving
        appetite. In it Mr. TROWBRIDGE has not lectured
        or moralized or remonstrated; he has simply
        shown boys what they are doing when they
        contemplate hazing. By a good artistic impulse
        we are not shown the hazing at all; when the
        story begins, the hazing is already over, and
        we are introduced immediately to the results.
        It is an artistic touch also that the boy
        injured is not hurt because he is a fellow of
        delicate nerves, but because of his very
        strength, and the power with which he resisted
        until overcome by numbers, and subjected to
        treatment which left him insane. His insanity
        takes the form of harmless delusion, and the
        absurdity of his ways and talk enables the
        author to lighten the sombreness without
        weakening the moral, in a way that ought to win
        all boys to his side."--_The Critic._



=THE TOBY TRAFFORD SERIES. 3 volumes.=

=The Fortunes of Toby Trafford.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated.
$1.25.

        "If to make children's stories as true to
        nature as the stories which the masters of
        fiction write for children of a larger growth
        be an uncommon achievement, and one that is
        worthy of wide recognition, that recognition
        should be given to Mr. J. T. TROWBRIDGE for his
        many achievements in this difficult walk of
        literary art. Mr. TROWBRIDGE has a good
        perception of character, which he draws with
        skill; he has abundance of invention, which he
        never abuses; and he has, what so many American
        writers have not, an easy, graceful style,
        which can be humorous, or pathetic, or
        poetic."--_R. H. Stoddard in New York Mail._


=Father Brighthopes:= AN OLD CLERGYMAN'S VACATION. By J. T. TROWBRIDGE.
Illustrated. $1.25.

        This book was published in the early fifties by
        Phillips, Sampson & Co., of which firm Mr. Lee
        (of Lee and Shepard) was then a member. It was
        very favorably received, and was followed by
        other stories,--a long series of them,--still
        lengthening, and which, it is hoped, may be
        prolonged indefinitely. Recently a new edition
        has appeared, and for a preface the author has
        related with touching simplicity the account of
        his first experience in authorship.

        It is well known that Mr. TROWBRIDGE is
        primarily a poet. Some beautiful poems of his
        were printed in the early numbers of the
        _Atlantic Monthly_ (in company with poems by
        LONGFELLOW, EMERSON, LOWELL, and HOLMES), and
        were well received. "At Sea" is a gem that has
        become classic. The poetic faculty has not been
        without use to the story-writer. The perception
        of beauty in nature and in human nature is
        always evident even in his realistic prose. But
        his poetic gift never leads him into
        sentimentality, and his characters are true
        children of men, with natural faults as well as
        natural gifts and graces. His stories are
        intensely _human_, with a solid basis, and with
        an instinctive dramatic action. He has never
        written an uninteresting book.


=Woodie Thorpe's Pilgrimage=, AND OTHER STORIES. By J. T. TROWBRIDGE.
Illustrated. $1.25.

        "The scenes are full of human interest and
        lifelikeness, and will please many an old
        reader, as well as the younger folks for whose
        delectation it is intended. As in all the books
        of this author the spirit is manly, sincere,
        and in the best sense moral. There is no
        'goody' talk and no cant, but principles of
        truthfulness, integrity, and self-reliance are
        quietly inculcated by example. It is safe to
        say that any boy will be the better for reading
        books like this."--_St. Botolph._
