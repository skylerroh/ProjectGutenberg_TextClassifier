
THE FICKLENESS OF A ROMAN MOB

From "Julius Caesar" Act I. Scene i.

_Enter_ FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, _and certain Commoners over the Stage._


_Flav._ Hence! home, you idle creatures, get you home.
Is this a holiday? What! know you not,
Being mechanical, you ought not walk
Upon a labouring day without the sign
Of your profession?--Speak, what trade art thou?                       5

_1 Cit._ Why, sir, a carpenter.

_Mar._ Where is thy leather apron, and thy rule?
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?--
You, sir, what trade are you?

_2 Cit._ Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am               10
but, as you would say, a cobbler.

_Mar._ But what trade are thou? Answer me directly.

_2 Cit._ A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe
conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.

_Mar._ What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave,                    15
what trade?

_2 Cit._ Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me;
yet, if you be out, sir, I can mend you.

_Mar._ What mean'st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fellow?

_2 Cit._ Why, sir, cobble you.                                        20

_Flav._ Thou art a cobbler, art thou?

_2 Cit._ Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl.
I meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's
matters, but with all. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon to
old shoes; when they are in great danger, I re-cover                  25
them. As proper men as ever trod upon neat's leather
have gone upon my handiwork.

_Flav._ But wherefore art not in thy shop to-day?
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?

_2 Cit._ Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get                  30
myself into more work.  But, indeed, sir, we make
holiday to see Caesar, and to rejoice in his triumph.

_Mar._ Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
What tributaries follow him to Rome,
To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?                         35
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
O, you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
Have you climbed up to walls and battlements,
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,                          40
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
The livelong day, with patient expectation,
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome;
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
Have you not made an universal shout,                                 45
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
To hear the replication of your sounds
Made in her concave shores?
And do you now put on your best attire?
And do you now cull out a holiday?                                    50
And do you now strew flowers in his way
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?
Be gone!
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague                               55
That needs must light on this ingratitude.

_Flav._ Go, go, good countrymen, and for this fault
Assemble all the poor men of your sort;
Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
Into the channel, till the lowest stream                              60
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.

[_Exeunt all the Commoners_]

See, whe'r their basest metal be not moved!
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
This way will I. Disrobe the images,                                  65
If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.

_Mar._ May we do so?
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.

_Flav._ It is no matter; let no images
Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,                            70
And drive away the vulgar from the streets;
So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
Who else would soar above the view of men,                            75
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.

SIR PETER AND LADY TEAZLE

From "The School for Scandal"


_Sir Peter._--Lady Teazle, Lady Teazle, I'll not bear it!

_Lady Teazle._--Sir Peter, Sir Peter, you may bear it or not, as you
please; but I ought to have my own way in everything, and, what's
more, I will, too. What though I was educated in the country, I know
very well that women of fashion in London are accountable to nobody
after they are married.

_Sir Peter._--Very well, ma'am, very well; so a husband is to have no
influence, no authority?

_Lady Teazle._--Authority! No, to be sure: if you wanted authority
over me, you should have adopted me and not married me: I am sure you
were old enough.

_Sir Peter._--Old enough!--ay, there it is. Well, well, Lady Teazle,
though my life may be made unhappy by your temper, I'll not be ruined
by your extravagance!

_Lady Teazle._--My extravagance! I'm sure I'm not more extravagant
than a woman of fashion ought to be.

_Sir Peter._--No, no, madam, you shall throw away no more sums on such
unmeaning luxury. To spend as much to furnish your dressing room with
flowers in winter as would suffice to turn the Pantheon into a
greenhouse, and give a fete champetre at Christmas!

_Lady Teazle._--And am I to blame, Sir Peter, because flowers are dear
in cold weather? You should find fault with the climate, and not with
me. For my part, I'm sure I wish it was spring all the year round,
and that roses grew under our feet!

_Sir Peter._--Oons! madam--if you had been born to this, I shouldn't
wonder at your talking thus; but you forget what your situation was
when I married you.

_Lady Teazle._--No, no, I don't; 'twas a very disagreeable one, or I
should never have married you.

_Sir Peter._--Yes, yes, madam, you were then in somewhat a humbler
style--the daughter of a plain country squire. Recollect, Lady Teazle,
when I saw you first sitting at your tambour, in a pretty figured
linen gown, with a bunch of keys at your side, your hair combed smooth
over a roll, and your apartment hung round with fruits in worsted, of
your own working.

_Lady Teazle._--Oh, yes! I remember it very well, and a curious life I
led. My daily occupation to inspect the dairy, superintend the
poultry, make extracts from the family receipt book, and comb my aunt
Deborah's lap-dog.

_Sir Peter._--Yes, yes, ma'am, 'twas so indeed.

_Lady Teazle._--And then, you know, my evening amusements! To draw
patterns for ruffles, which I had not materials to make up; to play
Pope Joan with the curate; to read a sermon to my aunt; or to be stuck
down to an old spinet to strum my father to sleep after a fox chase.

_Sir Peter._--I am glad you have so good a memory. Yes, madam, these
were the recreations I took you from; but now you must have your
coach--_vis-a-vis_--and three powdered footmen before your chair; and,
in the summer, a pair of white cats to draw you to Kensington Gardens.
No recollection, I suppose, when you were content to ride double,
behind the butler, on a docked coach horse.

_Lady Teazle._--No--I swear I never did that: I deny the butler and
the coach horse.

_Sir Peter._--This, madam, was your situation; and what have I done
for you? I have made you a woman of fashion, of fortune, of rank,--in
short, I have made you my wife.

_Lady Teazle._--Well, then, and there is but one thing more you can
make me to add to the obligation, that is--

_Sir Peter._--My widow, I suppose?

_Lady Teazle._--Hem! hem!

_Sir Peter._--I thank you, madam--but don't flatter yourself, for,
though your ill conduct may disturb my peace of mind, it shall never
break my heart, I promise you: however, I am equally obliged to you
for the hint.

_Lady Teazle._--Then why will you endeavour to make yourself so
disagreeable to me, and thwart me in every little elegant expense.

_Sir Peter._--Oons! madam, I say, had you any of these little elegant
expenses when you married me?

_Lady Teazle._--Lud, Sir Peter! would you have me be out of the
fashion?

_Sir Peter._--The fashion, indeed! what had you to do with the fashion
before you married me?

_Lady Teazle._--For my part, I should think you would like to have
your wife thought a woman of taste.

_Sir Peter._--Ay--there again--taste! Zounds! madam, you had no taste
when you married me!

_Lady Teazle._--That's very true, indeed, Sir Peter! and, after
having married you, I should never pretend to taste again, I allow.
But now, Sir Peter, since we have finished our daily jangle, I presume
I may go to my engagement at Lady Sneerwell's.

_Sir Peter._--Ay, there's another precious circumstance--a charming
set of acquaintance you have made there.

_Lady Teazle._--Nay, Sir Peter, they are all people of rank and
fortune, and remarkably tenacious of reputation.

_Sir Peter._--Yes, they are tenacious of reputation with a vengeance;
for they don't choose anybody should have a character but themselves!
Such a crew! Ah! many a wretch has rid on a hurdle who has done less
mischief than these utterers of forged tales, coiners of scandal, and
clippers of reputation.

_Lady Teazle._--What! would you restrain the freedom of speech?

_Sir Peter._--Ah! they have made you just as bad as any one of the
society.

_Lady Teazle._--Why, I believe I do bear a part with a tolerable
grace.

_Sir Peter._--Grace indeed!

_Lady Teazle._--But I vow I bear no malice against the people I abuse:
when I say an ill-natured thing, 'tis out of pure good humour: and I
take it for granted they deal exactly the same with me. But, Sir
Peter, you know you promised to come to Lady Sneerwell's too.

_Sir Peter._--Well, well, I'll call in, just to look after my own
character.

_Lady Teazle._--Then, indeed, you must make haste after me, or you'll
be too late. So good-bye to ye. (_Exit_)

_Sir Peter._--So--I have gained much by my intended expostulation!
Yet with what a charming air she contradicts everything I say, and how
pleasantly she shows her contempt for my authority! Well, though I
can't make her love me, there is great satisfaction in quarrelling
with her; and I think she never appears to such advantage as when she
is doing everything in her power to plague me. _(Exit_)

THE PARTING OF MARMION AND DOUGLAS

From "Marmion"


  Not far advanced was morning day,
  When Marmion did his troop array
      To Surrey's camp to ride;
  He had safe-conduct for his band,
  Beneath the royal seal and hand,                                     5
      And Douglas gave a guide.

  The ancient Earl, with stately grace,
  Would Clara on her palfrey place,
  And whispered in an undertone,
  "Let the hawk stoop, his prey is flown."                            10
  The train from out the castle drew,
  But Marmion stopped to bid adieu:
  "Though something I might plain," he said,
  "Of cold respect to stranger guest,
  Sent hither by your King's behest,                                  15
      While in Tantallon's towers I stayed;
  Part we in friendship from your land,
  And, noble earl, receive my hand."

  But Douglas round him drew his cloak,
  Folded his arms, and thus he spoke:                                 20
  "My manors, halls, and bowers, shall still
  Be open, at my Sovereign's will,
  To each one whom he lists, howe'er
  Unmeet to be the owner's peer.
  My castles are my King's alone,                                     25
  From turret to foundation-stone:
  The hand of Douglas is his own;
  And never shall, in friendly grasp,
  The hand of such as Marmion clasp."

  Burned Marmion's swarthy cheek like fire,                           30
  And shook his very frame for ire;
      And--"This to me," he said,
  "An't were not for thy hoary beard,
  Such hand as Marmion's had not spared
      To cleave the Douglas' head!                                    35
  And, first, I tell thee, haughty peer,
  He who does England's message here,
  Although the meanest in her state,
  May well, proud Angus, be thy mate:
  And, Douglas, more I tell thee here,                                40
      Even in thy pitch of pride
  Here in thy hold, thy vassals near
  (Nay, never look upon your lord,
  And lay your hands upon your sword,)
      I tell thee, thou'rt defied!                                    45
  And if thou saidst, I am not peer
  To any lord in Scotland here,
  Lowland or Highland, far or near,
      Lord Angus, thou hast lied!"

  On the Earl's cheek the flush of rage                               50
  O'ercame the ashen hue of age:
  Fierce he broke forth: "And darest thou, then,
  To beard the lion in his den,
      The Douglas in his hall?
  And hopest thou hence unscathed to go?--                            55
  No, by Saint Bride of Bothwell, no!--
  Up drawbridge, grooms!--what, Warder, ho!
      Let the portcullis fall."

  Lord Marmion turned,--well was his need,--
  And dashed the rowels in his steed,                                 60
  Like arrow through the archway sprung,
  The ponderous grate behind him rung:
  To pass there was such scanty room,
  The bars, descending, grazed his plume.

  The steed along the drawbridge flies,                               65
  Just as it trembles on the rise;
  Nor lighter does the swallow skim
  Along the smooth lake's level brim:
  And when Lord Marmion reached his band,
  He halts, and turns with clenched hand,                             70
  And shout of loud defiance pours,
  And shook his gauntlet at the towers.

  "Horse! horse!" the Douglas cried, "and chase!"
  But soon he reined his fury's pace:
  "A royal messenger he came,                                         75
  Though most unworthy of the name.
  A letter forged! Saint Jude to speed!
  Did ever knight so foul a deed!
  At first, in heart, it liked me ill,
  When the King praised his clerkly skill.                            80
  Thanks to Saint Bothan, son of mine,
  Save Gawain, ne'er could pen a line.
  Saint Mary mend my fiery mood!
  Old age ne'er cools the Douglas blood;
  I thought to slay him where he stood.                               85
