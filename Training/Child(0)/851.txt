"If we could only find a house!" sighed Priscilla. "Look over there at
Kingsport, Anne--houses, houses everywhere, and not one for us."

"Stop it, Pris. 'The best is yet to be.' Like the old Roman, we'll find
a house or build one. On a day like this there's no such word as fail in
my bright lexicon."

They lingered in the park until sunset, living in the amazing miracle
and glory and wonder of the springtide; and they went home as usual, by
way of Spofford Avenue, that they might have the delight of looking at
Patty's Place.

"I feel as if something mysterious were going to happen right away--'by
the pricking of my thumbs,'" said Anne, as they went up the slope.
"It's a nice story-bookish feeling. Why--why--why! Priscilla Grant, look
over there and tell me if it's true, or am I seein' things?"

Priscilla looked. Anne's thumbs and eyes had not deceived her. Over the
arched gateway of Patty's Place dangled a little, modest sign. It said
"To Let, Furnished. Inquire Within."

"Priscilla," said Anne, in a whisper, "do you suppose it's possible that
we could rent Patty's Place?"

"No, I don't," averred Priscilla. "It would be too good to be
true. Fairy tales don't happen nowadays. I won't hope, Anne. The
disappointment would be too awful to bear. They're sure to want more for
it than we can afford. Remember, it's on Spofford Avenue."

"We must find out anyhow," said Anne resolutely. "It's too late to call
this evening, but we'll come tomorrow. Oh, Pris, if we can get this
darling spot! I've always felt that my fortunes were linked with Patty's
Place, ever since I saw it first."




Chapter X

Patty's Place


The next evening found them treading resolutely the herring-bone walk
through the tiny garden. The April wind was filling the pine trees with
its roundelay, and the grove was alive with robins--great, plump, saucy
fellows, strutting along the paths. The girls rang rather timidly, and
were admitted by a grim and ancient handmaiden. The door opened directly
into a large living-room, where by a cheery little fire sat two other
ladies, both of whom were also grim and ancient. Except that one looked
to be about seventy and the other fifty, there seemed little
difference between them. Each had amazingly big, light-blue eyes behind
steel-rimmed spectacles; each wore a cap and a gray shawl; each was
knitting without haste and without rest; each rocked placidly and looked
at the girls without speaking; and just behind each sat a large white
china dog, with round green spots all over it, a green nose and green
ears. Those dogs captured Anne's fancy on the spot; they seemed like the
twin guardian deities of Patty's Place.

For a few minutes nobody spoke. The girls were too nervous to find
words, and neither the ancient ladies nor the china dogs seemed
conversationally inclined. Anne glanced about the room. What a dear
place it was! Another door opened out of it directly into the pine grove
and the robins came boldly up on the very step. The floor was spotted
with round, braided mats, such as Marilla made at Green Gables, but
which were considered out of date everywhere else, even in Avonlea. And
yet here they were on Spofford Avenue! A big, polished grandfather's
clock ticked loudly and solemnly in a corner. There were delightful
little cupboards over the mantelpiece, behind whose glass doors
gleamed quaint bits of china. The walls were hung with old prints and
silhouettes. In one corner the stairs went up, and at the first low turn
was a long window with an inviting seat. It was all just as Anne had
known it must be.

By this time the silence had grown too dreadful, and Priscilla nudged
Anne to intimate that she must speak.

"We--we--saw by your sign that this house is to let," said Anne faintly,
addressing the older lady, who was evidently Miss Patty Spofford.

"Oh, yes," said Miss Patty. "I intended to take that sign down today."

"Then--then we are too late," said Anne sorrowfully. "You've let it to
some one else?"

"No, but we have decided not to let it at all."

"Oh, I'm so sorry," exclaimed Anne impulsively. "I love this place so. I
did hope we could have got it."

Then did Miss Patty lay down her knitting, take off her specs, rub them,
put them on again, and for the first time look at Anne as at a human
being. The other lady followed her example so perfectly that she might
as well have been a reflection in a mirror.

"You LOVE it," said Miss Patty with emphasis. "Does that mean that
you really LOVE it? Or that you merely like the looks of it? The girls
nowadays indulge in such exaggerated statements that one never can tell
what they DO mean. It wasn't so in my young days. THEN a girl did not
say she LOVED turnips, in just the same tone as she might have said she
loved her mother or her Savior."

Anne's conscience bore her up.

"I really do love it," she said gently. "I've loved it ever since I saw
it last fall. My two college chums and I want to keep house next year
instead of boarding, so we are looking for a little place to rent; and
when I saw that this house was to let I was so happy."

"If you love it, you can have it," said Miss Patty. "Maria and I decided
today that we would not let it after all, because we did not like any of
the people who have wanted it. We don't HAVE to let it. We can afford to
go to Europe even if we don't let it. It would help us out, but not for
gold will I let my home pass into the possession of such people as have
come here and looked at it. YOU are different. I believe you do love it
and will be good to it. You can have it."

"If--if we can afford to pay what you ask for it," hesitated Anne.

Miss Patty named the amount required. Anne and Priscilla looked at each
other. Priscilla shook her head.

"I'm afraid we can't afford quite so much," said Anne, choking back her
disappointment. "You see, we are only college girls and we are poor."

"What were you thinking you could afford?" demanded Miss Patty, ceasing
not to knit.

Anne named her amount. Miss Patty nodded gravely.

"That will do. As I told you, it is not strictly necessary that we
should let it at all. We are not rich, but we have enough to go to
Europe on. I have never been in Europe in my life, and never expected or
wanted to go. But my niece there, Maria Spofford, has taken a fancy
to go. Now, you know a young person like Maria can't go globetrotting
alone."

"No--I--I suppose not," murmured Anne, seeing that Miss Patty was quite
solemnly in earnest.

"Of course not. So I have to go along to look after her. I expect to
enjoy it, too; I'm seventy years old, but I'm not tired of living yet.
I daresay I'd have gone to Europe before if the idea had occurred to me.
We shall be away for two years, perhaps three. We sail in June and
we shall send you the key, and leave all in order for you to take
possession when you choose. We shall pack away a few things we prize
especially, but all the rest will be left."

"Will you leave the china dogs?" asked Anne timidly.

"Would you like me to?"

"Oh, indeed, yes. They are delightful."

A pleased expression came into Miss Patty's face.

"I think a great deal of those dogs," she said proudly. "They are over
a hundred years old, and they have sat on either side of this fireplace
ever since my brother Aaron brought them from London fifty years ago.
Spofford Avenue was called after my brother Aaron."

"A fine man he was," said Miss Maria, speaking for the first time. "Ah,
you don't see the like of him nowadays."

"He was a good uncle to you, Maria," said Miss Patty, with evident
emotion. "You do well to remember him."

"I shall always remember him," said Miss Maria solemnly. "I can see him,
this minute, standing there before that fire, with his hands under his
coat-tails, beaming on us."

Miss Maria took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes; but Miss Patty
came resolutely back from the regions of sentiment to those of business.

"I shall leave the dogs where they are, if you will promise to be very
careful of them," she said. "Their names are Gog and Magog. Gog looks
to the right and Magog to the left. And there's just one thing more. You
don't object, I hope, to this house being called Patty's Place?"

"No, indeed. We think that is one of the nicest things about it."

"You have sense, I see," said Miss Patty in a tone of great
satisfaction. "Would you believe it? All the people who came here to
rent the house wanted to know if they couldn't take the name off the
gate during their occupation of it. I told them roundly that the name
went with the house. This has been Patty's Place ever since my brother
Aaron left it to me in his will, and Patty's Place it shall remain until
I die and Maria dies. After that happens the next possessor can call it
any fool name he likes," concluded Miss Patty, much as she might have
said, "After that--the deluge." "And now, wouldn't you like to go over
the house and see it all before we consider the bargain made?"

Further exploration still further delighted the girls. Besides the
big living-room, there was a kitchen and a small bedroom downstairs.
Upstairs were three rooms, one large and two small. Anne took an
especial fancy to one of the small ones, looking out into the big
pines, and hoped it would be hers. It was papered in pale blue and had
a little, old-timey toilet table with sconces for candles. There was a
diamond-paned window with a seat under the blue muslin frills that would
be a satisfying spot for studying or dreaming.

"It's all so delicious that I know we are going to wake up and find it a
fleeting vision of the night," said Priscilla as they went away.

"Miss Patty and Miss Maria are hardly such stuff as dreams are made of,"
laughed Anne. "Can you fancy them 'globe-trotting'--especially in those
shawls and caps?"

"I suppose they'll take them off when they really begin to trot," said
Priscilla, "but I know they'll take their knitting with them everywhere.
They simply couldn't be parted from it. They will walk about Westminster
Abbey and knit, I feel sure. Meanwhile, Anne, we shall be living in
Patty's Place--and on Spofford Avenue. I feel like a millionairess even
now."

"I feel like one of the morning stars that sang for joy," said Anne.

Phil Gordon crept into Thirty-eight, St. John's, that night and flung
herself on Anne's bed.

"Girls, dear, I'm tired to death. I feel like the man without a
country--or was it without a shadow? I forget which. Anyway, I've been
packing up."

"And I suppose you are worn out because you couldn't decide which things
to pack first, or where to put them," laughed Priscilla.

"E-zackly. And when I had got everything jammed in somehow, and my
landlady and her maid had both sat on it while I locked it, I discovered
I had packed a whole lot of things I wanted for Convocation at the very
bottom. I had to unlock the old thing and poke and dive into it for an
hour before I fished out what I wanted. I would get hold of something
that felt like what I was looking for, and I'd yank it up, and it would
be something else. No, Anne, I did NOT swear."

"I didn't say you did."

"Well, you looked it. But I admit my thoughts verged on the profane. And
I have such a cold in the head--I can do nothing but sniffle, sigh
and sneeze. Isn't that alliterative agony for you? Queen Anne, do say
something to cheer me up."

"Remember that next Thursday night, you'll be back in the land of Alec
and Alonzo," suggested Anne.

Phil shook her head dolefully.

"More alliteration. No, I don't want Alec and Alonzo when I have a
cold in the head. But what has happened you two? Now that I look at
you closely you seem all lighted up with an internal iridescence. Why,
you're actually SHINING! What's up?"

"We are going to live in Patty's Place next winter," said Anne
triumphantly. "Live, mark you, not board! We've rented it, and Stella
Maynard is coming, and her aunt is going to keep house for us."

Phil bounced up, wiped her nose, and fell on her knees before Anne.

"Girls--girls--let me come, too. Oh, I'll be so good. If there's no room
for me I'll sleep in the little doghouse in the orchard--I've seen it.
Only let me come."

"Get up, you goose."

"I won't stir off my marrow bones till you tell me I can live with you
next winter."

Anne and Priscilla looked at each other. Then Anne said slowly, "Phil
dear, we'd love to have you. But we may as well speak plainly. I'm
poor--Pris is poor--Stella Maynard is poor--our housekeeping will have
to be very simple and our table plain. You'd have to live as we would.
Now, you are rich and your boardinghouse fare attests the fact."

"Oh, what do I care for that?" demanded Phil tragically. "Better a
dinner of herbs where your chums are than a stalled ox in a lonely
boardinghouse. Don't think I'm ALL stomach, girls. I'll be willing to
live on bread and water--with just a LEETLE jam--if you'll let me come."

"And then," continued Anne, "there will be a good deal of work to be
done. Stella's aunt can't do it all. We all expect to have our chores to
do. Now, you--"

"Toil not, neither do I spin," finished Philippa. "But I'll learn to do
things. You'll only have to show me once. I CAN make my own bed to begin
with. And remember that, though I can't cook, I CAN keep my temper.
That's something. And I NEVER growl about the weather. That's more. Oh,
please, please! I never wanted anything so much in my life--and this
floor is awfully hard."

"There's just one more thing," said Priscilla resolutely. "You, Phil,
as all Redmond knows, entertain callers almost every evening. Now, at
Patty's Place we can't do that. We have decided that we shall be at home
to our friends on Friday evenings only. If you come with us you'll have
to abide by that rule."

"Well, you don't think I'll mind that, do you? Why, I'm glad of it.
I knew I should have had some such rule myself, but I hadn't enough
decision to make it or stick to it. When I can shuffle off the
responsibility on you it will be a real relief. If you won't let me cast
in my lot with you I'll die of the disappointment and then I'll come
back and haunt you. I'll camp on the very doorstep of Patty's Place and
you won't be able to go out or come in without falling over my spook."

Again Anne and Priscilla exchanged eloquent looks.

"Well," said Anne, "of course we can't promise to take you until we've
consulted with Stella; but I don't think she'll object, and, as far as
we are concerned, you may come and glad welcome."

"If you get tired of our simple life you can leave us, and no questions
asked," added Priscilla.
