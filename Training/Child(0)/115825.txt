"I'M GOING TO."

PART I.


Once upon a time, there was a little boy, whose name was Johnny.
"Johnny," said his mamma, one day, "will you bring me an armful of
wood?"

"Yes," said Johnny, "I'm going to"; but just then he heard Carlo, the
dog, barking at a chipmunk over in the meadow, so he ran off as fast as
he could go.

Now this was not the first time that Johnny had said to his mamma, "Yes,
I'm going to." He never thought of that wood again until about
dinner-time, when he began to feel hungry.

When he got back, he found that dinner was over, and papa and mamma had
gone to ride. He found a piece of bread and butter, and sat down on a
Large rock, with his back against the stump of a tree, to eat it.

When it was all gone, Johnny began to think what he should do next. He
closed his eyes as people are apt to do when they think.

Presently he heard a score of voices about him. One was saying, "Wait a
bit"; another, "Pretty soon"; another, "In a minute"; another, "By and
by"; and still another, louder than the rest, kept screaming as loud as
it could, "Going to, going to, going to," till Johnny thought they were
crazy.

"Who in the world are you?" said he, in great surprise, "and what are
you making such a noise about?"

"We are telling our names," said they; "didn't you ask us to tell our
names?"

"No," said Johnny, "I didn't."

"O what a story!" cried they all in a breath.

[Illustration]

"Let's shake him for it," said one.

"No, let us carry him to the king," said another.

So they began to spin about him like so many spiders; for each one of
them carried a long web, and when that gets wound around a boy or a
girl, it is a very difficult thing to get rid of.

In a few minutes they had him all wound up--hands and feet, nose and
eyes, all tied up tight. Then they took him among them, and flew away
with him, miles and miles, over the hills, and up to a big cave in the
mountain. There he heard ever so many more voices, and it was noisier
than ever.

"Where am I?" he said, as soon as he could speak.

"O you're safe at home," answered Wait-a-bit, for he seemed to be the
spokesman; "and they have been expecting you for some time."

"This isn't my home," said Johnny, feeling very miserable and beginning
to cry.

"O yes, it is," said a chorus of voices. "This is just where such folks
as you belong. There are many of your fellows here, and you won't be
lonesome a bit."

They had begun to unwind the web from his eyes now, so he opened them
and looked about him. O what a wretched place it was!

Against the sides of the cave, stood long rows of boys and girls, with
very sorry faces, all of them saying over as fast as they could speak,
"Going to, going to!" "Wait a bit, wait a bit!" "Pretty soon, pretty
soon!" "In a minute, in a minute!" studying the names just as hard as if
they were lessons.

There were Delays, and Tardys, and Put-offs, with ever so many more; and
in a corner by themselves, and looking more unhappy than all the rest,
were the poor little fellows whose names were "Too late."

Directions for Reading.--Pupils should read loud enough for all the
class to hear them.

The words forming a _quotation_ should usually be spoken in a louder
tone than the other words in the lesson, as--

_"Johnny,"_ said his mamma, one day, _"will you bring me an armful of
wood?"_


       *       *       *       *       *


Language Lesson.--Divide into syllables, accent, and mark the sounds
of the letters in the following words: _Carlo, armful, mountain,
unwind_.

What two words can be used for each of the following: _I'm, didn't,
let's, you're, isn't, won't?_

What other words could be used instead of _got_ (page 16, line 4)?[02]

Proper names should begin with capital letters: as, _Johnny, Carlo_.

Give three other words used as proper names in this lesson.

pro cras' ti na tor, _one who puts off doing any thing_.

res o lu'tions, _promises made to one's self; resolves_.

yon'der, _there; in that place_.

mon'strous, _of great size_.

"I'M GOING TO."

PART II.


"O dear, dear! Where am I?" said Johnny in despair. "Please let me out!
I want my mamma!"

"No, you don't," said Wait-a-bit. "You don't care much about her, and
this is really where you belong. This is the kingdom of Procrastination,
and yonder comes the king."

"The kingdom of what?" said Johnny, who had never heard such a long word
in his life before.

But just then he heard a heavy foot-fall, and a great voice that sounded
like a roar, saying, "Has he come? Did you get him?"

"Yes, here he is," said Wait-a-bit, "and he'd just been saying it a
little while before we picked him up."

Johnny looked up and saw a monstrous giant, with a bright green body and
red legs, and a yellow head and two horrid coal-black eyes.

"Let me have him," said the giant. So he took him up just as if he had
been a rag-baby, and looked him all over, turning him from side to side,
and from head to feet.

O but Johnny was frightened, and expected every moment to be swallowed!

"Let's see," said the giant; "he always says 'Pretty soon.' No, that
isn't it. What is it, my fine fellow, that you always say to your mamma
when she asks you to do any thing for her?

"It isn't 'Pretty soon,' nor 'In a minute.' What is it? They all mean
about the same thing, to be sure, and bring every body to me in the end;
but I must know exactly, or I can't put you in the right place."

Johnny hung his head, and did not want to tell; but an extra hard poke
of the giant's big finger made him open his mouth and say with shame,
that he always said, "I'm going to."

"O that's it!" said the giant. "Well, then, you stand there."

So he unwound a bit of the web from his fingers--just enough so that he
could hold the Procrastinator's Primer--and stood him at the end of a
long row of children, who were saying over and over again, just as fast
as they could speak, "Going to, going to, going to, going to," just
that, and nothing else in the world.

Johnny was tired and hungry by this time, and longed to see his mamma,
thinking that, if he could only get back: to her, he would always mind
the very moment she told him to do any thing.

He made a great many good resolutions while he stood there. At last the
giant called him to come and say his lesson.

"You shall have a short one to-day," said he, "and need say it only a
thousand times, because it is your first day here. To-morrow, you must
say it a million."

Johnny tried to step forward, but the web was still about his feet, so
he fell with, a bang to the floor.

Just then he opened his eyes to find that he had rolled from the rock
to the grass, and that mamma was calling him in a loud voice to come to
supper, and this time he didn't say, "I'm going to."


       *       *       *       *       *


Directions for Reading.--The words in quotation marks should be read in
the same manner as in Lesson I.

Read words in dark type in the following sentences with more force than
the other words:

    "Has he _come?_ Did you _get_ him?"

Words that are read more forcibly than other words in a sentence are
called _emphatic words_.

Which are the _emphatic words_ in the following sentences?

    "You shall have a short one to-day."

    "I must know exactly."


       *       *       *       *       *


Language Lesson.--Divide into syllables, accent, and mark the sounds
of the letters in the following words: _extra, primer, moment,
coal-black_.


       *       *       *       *       *




LESSON III.


remark'able, _worthy of notice; unusual_.

moist'ure, _wetness; that which makes wet_.

absorbed', _sucked up; drunk up_.

with'er, _lose freshness_.

starched, _stiffened, as starch_.

germ, _that from which the plant grows; bud_.

hand'some, _pleasing in appearance; very pretty_.

clasped, _surrounded; inclosed_.


       *       *       *       *       *




THE BEAN AND THE STONE.


"I think I ought to be doing something in the world!" said a little
voice out in the garden.

"Pray, what can you do?" asked another and somewhat stronger voice.

"I think I can grow," answered the little voice.

If you had seen the owner of the little voice, perhaps you would not
have thought him any thing remarkable.

It is true he had on a clean white coat, so smooth and shining that it
looked as if it had been newly starched and ironed, and inside of this,
he hugged two stout packages.

The coat had only one fastening; but that fastening extended down the
back, and was a curious thing to see.
