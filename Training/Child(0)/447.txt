Cliffie Wright that A is A. He never knew it before. Isn't it something
to have started a soul along a path that may end in Shakespeare and
Paradise Lost?"

Mrs. Lynde came up later on with more encouragement. That good lady had
waylaid the schoolchildren at her gate and demanded of them how they
liked their new teacher.

"And every one of them said they liked you splendid, Anne, except
Anthony Pye. I must admit he didn't. He said you 'weren't any good,
just like all girl teachers.' There's the Pye leaven for you. But never
mind."

"I'm not going to mind," said Anne quietly, "and I'm going to make
Anthony Pye like me yet. Patience and kindness will surely win him."

"Well, you can never tell about a Pye," said Mrs. Rachel cautiously.
"They go by contraries, like dreams, often as not. As for that DonNELL
woman, she'll get no DonNELLing from me, I can assure you. The name is
DONnell and always has been. The woman is crazy, that's what. She has a
pug dog she calls Queenie and it has its meals at the table along with
the family, eating off a china plate. I'd be afraid of a judgment if I
was her. Thomas says Donnell himself is a sensible, hard-working man,
but he hadn't much gumption when he picked out a wife, that's what."

All Sorts and Conditions of Men . . . and women


A September day on Prince Edward Island hills; a crisp wind blowing
up over the sand dunes from the sea; a long red road, winding through
fields and woods, now looping itself about a corner of thick set
spruces, now threading a plantation of young maples with great feathery
sheets of ferns beneath them, now dipping down into a hollow where a
brook flashed out of the woods and into them again, now basking in
open sunshine between ribbons of golden-rod and smoke-blue asters;
air athrill with the pipings of myriads of crickets, those glad little
pensioners of the summer hills; a plump brown pony ambling along the
road; two girls behind him, full to the lips with the simple, priceless
joy of youth and life.

"Oh, this is a day left over from Eden, isn't it, Diana?" . . . and Anne
sighed for sheer happiness. "The air has magic in it. Look at the purple
in the cup of the harvest valley, Diana. And oh, do smell the dying fir!
It's coming up from that little sunny hollow where Mr. Eben Wright has
been cutting fence poles. Bliss is it on such a day to be alive; but
to smell dying fir is very heaven. That's two thirds Wordsworth and one
third Anne Shirley. It doesn't seem possible that there should be dying
fir in heaven, does it? And yet it doesn't seem to me that heaven would
be quite perfect if you couldn't get a whiff of dead fir as you went
through its woods. Perhaps we'll have the odor there without the death.
Yes, I think that will be the way. That delicious aroma must be the
souls of the firs . . . and of course it will be just souls in heaven."

"Trees haven't souls," said practical Diana, "but the smell of dead fir
is certainly lovely. I'm going to make a cushion and fill it with fir
needles. You'd better make one too, Anne."

"I think I shall . . . and use it for my naps. I'd be certain to dream I
was a dryad or a woodnymph then. But just this minute I'm well content
to be Anne Shirley, Avonlea schoolma'am, driving over a road like this
on such a sweet, friendly day."

"It's a lovely day but we have anything but a lovely task before us,"
sighed Diana. "Why on earth did you offer to canvass this road, Anne?
Almost all the cranks in Avonlea live along it, and we'll probably be
treated as if we were begging for ourselves. It's the very worst road of
all."

"That is why I chose it. Of course Gilbert and Fred would have taken
this road if we had asked them. But you see, Diana, I feel myself
responsible for the A.V.I.S., since I was the first to suggest it, and
it seems to me that I ought to do the most disagreeable things. I'm
sorry on your account; but you needn't say a word at the cranky places.
I'll do all the talking . . .  Mrs. Lynde would say I was well able to.
Mrs. Lynde doesn't know whether to approve of our enterprise or not. She
inclines to, when she remembers that Mr. and Mrs. Allan are in favor of
it; but the fact that village improvement societies first originated in
the States is a count against it. So she is halting between two opinions
and only success will justify us in Mrs. Lynde's eyes. Priscilla is
going to write a paper for our next Improvement meeting, and I expect it
will be good, for her aunt is such a clever writer and no doubt it runs
in the family. I shall never forget the thrill it gave me when I found
out that Mrs. Charlotte E. Morgan was Priscilla's aunt. It seemed so
wonderful that I was a friend of the girl whose aunt wrote 'Edgewood
Days' and 'The Rosebud Garden.'"

"Where does Mrs. Morgan live?"

"In Toronto. And Priscilla says she is coming to the Island for a visit
next summer, and if it is possible Priscilla is going to arrange to have
us meet her. That seems almost too good to be true--but it's something
pleasant to imagine after you go to bed."

The Avonlea Village Improvement Society was an organized fact.
Gilbert Blythe was president, Fred Wright vice-president, Anne Shirley
secretary, and Diana Barry treasurer. The "Improvers," as they were
promptly christened, were to meet once a fortnight at the homes of
the members. It was admitted that they could not expect to affect many
improvements so late in the season; but they meant to plan the next
summer's campaign, collect and discuss ideas, write and read papers,
and, as Anne said, educate the public sentiment generally.

There was some disapproval, of course, and . . . which the Improvers felt
much more keenly . . . a good deal of ridicule. Mr. Elisha Wright was
reported to have said that a more appropriate name for the organization
would be Courting Club. Mrs. Hiram Sloane declared she had heard the
Improvers meant to plough up all the roadsides and set them out with
geraniums. Mr. Levi Boulter warned his neighbors that the Improvers
would insist that everybody pull down his house and rebuild it after
plans approved by the society. Mr. James Spencer sent them word that he
wished they would kindly shovel down the church hill. Eben Wright told
Anne that he wished the Improvers could induce old Josiah Sloane to
keep his whiskers trimmed. Mr. Lawrence Bell said he would whitewash
his barns if nothing else would please them but he would NOT hang lace
curtains in the cowstable windows. Mr. Major Spencer asked Clifton
Sloane, an Improver who drove the milk to the Carmody cheese factory,
if it was true that everybody would have to have his milk-stand
hand-painted next summer and keep an embroidered centerpiece on it.

In spite of . . . or perhaps, human nature being what it is, because of
. . . this, the Society went gamely to work at the only improvement they
could hope to bring about that fall. At the second meeting, in the Barry
parlor, Oliver Sloane moved that they start a subscription to re-shingle
and paint the hall; Julia Bell seconded it, with an uneasy feeling that
she was doing something not exactly ladylike. Gilbert put the motion,
it was carried unanimously, and Anne gravely recorded it in her minutes.
The next thing was to appoint a committee, and Gertie Pye, determined
not to let Julia Bell carry off all the laurels, boldly moved that Miss
Jane Andrews be chairman of said committee. This motion being also duly
seconded and carried, Jane returned the compliment by appointing Gertie
on the committee, along with Gilbert, Anne, Diana, and Fred Wright. The
committee chose their routes in private conclave. Anne and Diana were
told off for the Newbridge road, Gilbert and Fred for the White Sands
road, and Jane and Gertie for the Carmody road.

"Because," explained Gilbert to Anne, as they walked home together
through the Haunted Wood, "the Pyes all live along that road and they
won't give a cent unless one of themselves canvasses them."

The next Saturday Anne and Diana started out. They drove to the end of
the road and canvassed homeward, calling first on the "Andrew girls."

"If Catherine is alone we may get something," said Diana, "but if Eliza
is there we won't."

Eliza was there . . . very much so . . . and looked even grimmer than
usual. Miss Eliza was one of those people who give you the impression
that life is indeed a vale of tears, and that a smile, never to speak of
a laugh, is a waste of nervous energy truly reprehensible. The Andrew
girls had been "girls" for fifty odd years and seemed likely to remain
girls to the end of their earthly pilgrimage. Catherine, it was said,
had not entirely given up hope, but Eliza, who was born a pessimist, had
never had any. They lived in a little brown house built in a sunny
corner scooped out of Mark Andrew's beech woods. Eliza complained that
it was terrible hot in summer, but Catherine was wont to say it was
lovely and warm in winter.

Eliza was sewing patchwork, not because it was needed but simply as
a protest against the frivolous lace Catherine was crocheting. Eliza
listened with a frown and Catherine with a smile, as the girls explained
their errand. To be sure, whenever Catherine caught Eliza's eye she
discarded the smile in guilty confusion; but it crept back the next
moment.

"If I had money to waste," said Eliza grimly, "I'd burn it up and have
the fun of seeing a blaze maybe; but I wouldn't give it to that hall,
not a cent. It's no benefit to the settlement . . . just a place for young
folks to meet and carry on when they's better be home in their beds."

"Oh, Eliza, young folks must have some amusement," protested Catherine.

"I don't see the necessity. We didn't gad about to halls and places when
we were young, Catherine Andrews. This world is getting worse every day."

"I think it's getting better," said Catherine firmly.

"YOU think!" Miss Eliza's voice expressed the utmost contempt. "It
doesn't signify what you THINK, Catherine Andrews. Facts is facts."

"Well, I always like to look on the bright side, Eliza."

"There isn't any bright side."

"Oh, indeed there is," cried Anne, who couldn't endure such heresy in
silence. "Why, there are ever so many bright sides, Miss Andrews. It's
really a beautiful world."

"You won't have such a high opinion of it when you've lived as long
in it as I have," retorted Miss Eliza sourly, "and you won't be so
enthusiastic about improving it either. How is your mother, Diana? Dear
me, but she has failed of late. She looks terrible run down. And how
long is it before Marilla expects to be stone blind, Anne?"

"The doctor thinks her eyes will not get any worse if she is very
careful," faltered Anne.

Eliza shook her head.

"Doctors always talk like that just to keep people cheered up. I
wouldn't have much hope if I was her. It's best to be prepared for the
worst."

"But oughtn't we be prepared for the best too?" pleaded Anne. "It's just
as likely to happen as the worst."

"Not in my experience, and I've fifty-seven years to set against your
sixteen," retorted Eliza. "Going, are you? Well, I hope this new society
of yours will be able to keep Avonlea from running any further down hill
but I haven't much hope of it."

Anne and Diana got themselves thankfully out, and drove away as fast as
the fat pony could go. As they rounded the curve below the beech wood
a plump figure came speeding over Mr. Andrews' pasture, waving to them
excitedly. It was Catherine Andrews and she was so out of breath that
she could hardly speak, but she thrust a couple of quarters into Anne's
hand.

"That's my contribution to painting the hall," she gasped. "I'd like to
give you a dollar but I don't dare take more from my egg money for Eliza
would find it out if I did. I'm real interested in your society and I
believe you're going to do a lot of good. I'm an optimist. I HAVE to be,
living with Eliza. I must hurry back before she misses me . . . she thinks
I'm feeding the hens. I hope you'll have good luck canvassing, and don't
be cast down over what Eliza said. The world IS getting better . . . it
certainly is."

The next house was Daniel Blair's.

"Now, it all depends on whether his wife is home or not," said Diana,
as they jolted along a deep-rutted lane. "If she is we won't get a cent.
Everybody says Dan Blair doesn't dare have his hair cut without
asking her permission; and it's certain she's very close, to state it
moderately. She says she has to be just before she's generous. But Mrs.
Lynde says she's so much 'before' that generosity never catches up with
her at all."

Anne related their experience at the Blair place to Marilla that
evening.

"We tied the horse and then rapped at the kitchen door. Nobody came but
the door was open and we could hear somebody in the pantry, going on
dreadfully. We couldn't make out the words but Diana says she knows they
were swearing by the sound of them. I can't believe that of Mr.
Blair, for he is always so quiet and meek; but at least he had great
provocation, for Marilla, when that poor man came to the door, red as
a beet, with perspiration streaming down his face, he had on one of his
wife's big gingham aprons. 'I can't get this durned thing off,' he said,
'for the strings are tied in a hard knot and I can't bust 'em, so you'll
have to excuse me, ladies.' We begged him not to mention it and went in
and sat down. Mr. Blair sat down too; he twisted the apron around to
his back and rolled it up, but he did look so ashamed and worried that
I felt sorry for him, and Diana said she feared we had called at an
inconvenient time. 'Oh, not at all,' said Mr. Blair, trying to smile
. . . you know he is always very polite . . . 'I'm a little busy . . .
getting ready to bake a cake as it were. My wife got a telegram today
that her sister from Montreal is coming tonight and she's gone to the
train to meet her and left orders for me to make a cake for tea. She
writ out the recipe and told me what to do but I've clean forgot half
the directions already. And it says, 'flavor according to taste.' What
does that mean? How can you tell? And what if my taste doesn't happen to
be other people's taste? Would a tablespoon of vanilla be enough for a
small layer cake?"

"I felt sorrier than ever for the poor man. He didn't seem to be in his
proper sphere at all. I had heard of henpecked husbands and now I felt
that I saw one. It was on my lips to say, 'Mr. Blair, if you'll give
us a subscription for the hall I'll mix up your cake for you.' But I
suddenly thought it wouldn't be neighborly to drive too sharp a bargain
with a fellow creature in distress. So I offered to mix the cake for him
without any conditions at all. He just jumped at my offer. He said he'd
been used to making his own bread before he was married but he feared
cake was beyond him, and yet he hated to disappoint his wife. He got me
another apron, and Diana beat the eggs and I mixed the cake. Mr. Blair
ran about and got us the materials. He had forgotten all about his apron
and when he ran it streamed out behind him and Diana said she thought
she would die to see it. He said he could bake the cake all right . . . he
was used to that . . . and then he asked for our list and he put down four
dollars. So you see we were rewarded. But even if he hadn't given a cent
I'd always feel that we had done a truly Christian act in helping him."

Theodore White's was the next stopping place. Neither Anne nor Diana
had ever been there before, and they had only a very slight acquaintance
with Mrs. Theodore, who was not given to hospitality. Should they go to
the back or front door? While they held a whispered consultation Mrs.
Theodore appeared at the front door with an armful of newspapers.
Deliberately she laid them down one by one on the porch floor and the
porch steps, and then down the path to the very feet of her mystified
callers.

"Will you please wipe your feet carefully on the grass and then walk on
these papers?" she said anxiously. "I've just swept the house all over
and I can't have any more dust tracked in. The path's been real muddy
since the rain yesterday."

"Don't you dare laugh," warned Anne in a whisper, as they marched along
the newspapers. "And I implore you, Diana, not to look at me, no matter
what she says, or I shall not be able to keep a sober face."

The papers extended across the hall and into a prim, fleckless parlor.
Anne and Diana sat down gingerly on the nearest chairs and explained
their errand. Mrs. White heard them politely, interrupting only twice,
once to chase out an adventurous fly, and once to pick up a tiny wisp
of grass that had fallen on the carpet from Anne's dress. Anne felt
wretchedly guilty; but Mrs. White subscribed two dollars and paid the
money down . . . "to prevent us from having to go back for it," Diana said
when they got away. Mrs. White had the newspapers gathered up before
they had their horse untied and as they drove out of the yard they saw
her busily wielding a broom in the hall.

"I've always heard that Mrs. Theodore White was the neatest woman
alive and I'll believe it after this," said Diana, giving way to her
suppressed laughter as soon as it was safe.

"I am glad she has no children," said Anne solemnly. "It would be
dreadful beyond words for them if she had."

At the Spencers' Mrs. Isabella Spencer made them miserable by saying
something ill-natured about everyone in Avonlea. Mr. Thomas Boulter
refused to give anything because the hall, when it had been built,
twenty years before, hadn't been built on the site he recommended. Mrs.
Esther Bell, who was the picture of health, took half an hour to detail
all her aches and pains, and sadly put down fifty cents because she
wouldn't be there that time next year to do it . . . no, she would be in
her grave.

Their worst reception, however, was at Simon Fletcher's. When they
drove into the yard they saw two faces peering at them through the porch
window. But although they rapped and waited patiently and persistently
nobody came to the door. Two decidedly ruffled and indignant girls drove
away from Simon Fletcher's. Even Anne admitted that she was beginning
