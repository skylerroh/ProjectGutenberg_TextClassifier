 =His One Fault.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

      "As for the hero of this story, 'His One Fault' was
      absent-mindedness. He forgot to lock his uncle's stable door, and
      the horse was stolen. In seeking to recover the stolen horse, he
      unintentionally stole another. In trying to restore the wrong horse
      to his rightful owner, he was himself arrested. After no end of
      comic and dolorous adventures, he surmounted all his misfortunes by
      downright pluck and genuine good feeling. It is a noble contribution
      to juvenile literature."--_Woman's Journal._


 =Peter Budstone.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

      "TROWBRIDGE'S other books have been admirable and deservedly
      popular, but this one, in our opinion, is the best yet. It is a
      story at once spirited and touching, with a certain dramatic and
      artistic quality that appeals to the literary sense as well as to
      the story-loving appetite. In it Mr. TROWBRIDGE has not lectured
      or moralized or remonstrated; he has simply shown boys what they
      are doing when they contemplate hazing. By a good artistic impulse
      we are not shown the hazing at all; when the story begins, the
      hazing is already over, and we are introduced immediately to the
      results. It is an artistic touch also that the boy injured is not
      hurt because he is a fellow of delicate nerves, but because of his
      very strength, and the power with which he resisted until overcome
      by numbers, and subjected to treatment which left him insane. His
      insanity takes the form of harmless delusion, and the absurdity of
      his ways and talk enables the author to lighten the sombreness
      without weakening the moral, in a way that ought to win all boys to
      his side."--_The Critic._


                   THE SILVER MEDAL STORIES. 6 volumes.


 =The Silver Medal=, AND OTHER STORIES. By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated.
            $1.25.

            There were some schoolboys who had turned housebreakers, and
      among their plunder was a silver medal that had been given to one
      John Harrison by the Humane Society for rescuing from drowning a
      certain Benton Barry. Now Benton Barry was one of the wretched
      housebreakers. This is the summary of the opening chapter. The
      story is intensely interesting in its serious as well as its
      humorous parts.


 =His Own Master.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

      "This is a book after the typical boy's own heart. Its hero is a
      plucky young fellow, who, seeing no chance for himself at home,
      determines to make his own way in the world.... He sets out
      accordingly, trudges to the far West, and finds the road to fortune
      an unpleasantly rough one."--_Philadelphia Inquirer._

      "We class this as one of the best stories for boys we ever read.
      The tone is perfectly healthy, and the interest is kept up to the
      end."--_Boston Home Journal._


 =Bound in Honor.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

      This story is of a lad, who, though not guilty of any bad action,
      had been an eye-witness of the conduct of his comrades, and felt
      "Bound in Honor" not to tell.

      "The glimpses we get of New England character are free from any
      distortion, and their humorous phases are always entertaining. Mr.
      TROWBRIDGE'S brilliant descriptive faculty is shown to great
      advantage in the opening chapter of the book by a vivid picture of
      a village fire, and is manifested elsewhere with equally telling
      effect."--_Boston Courier._


 =The Pocket Rifle.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

      "A boy's story which will be read with avidity, as it ought to
      be, it is so brightly and frankly written, and with such evident
      knowledge of the temperaments and habits, the friendships and
      enmities of schoolboys."--_New York Mail._

      "This is a capital story for boys. TROWBRIDGE never tells a story
      poorly. It teaches honesty, integrity, and friendship, and how
      best they can be promoted. It shows the danger of hasty judgment
      and circumstantial evidence; that right-doing pays, and dishonesty
      never."--_Chicago Inter-Ocean._


 =The Jolly Rover.= By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

      "This book will help to neutralize the ill effects of any poison
      which children may have swallowed in the way of sham-adventurous
      stories and wildly fictitious tales. 'The Jolly Rover' runs away
      from home, and meets life as it is, till he is glad enough to seek
      again his father's house. Mr. TROWBRIDGE has the power of making
      an instructive story absorbing in its interest, and of covering a
      moral so that it is easy to take."--_Christian Intelligencer._


 =Young Joe=, AND OTHER BOYS. By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.25.

      "Young Joe," who lived at Bass Cove, where he shot wild ducks, took
      some to town for sale, and attracted the attention of a portly
      gentleman fond of shooting. This gentleman went duck shooting with
      Joe, and their adventures were more amusing to the boy than to the
      amateur sportsman.

      There are thirteen other short stories in the book which will be
      sure to please the young folks.


 =The Vagabonds=: AN ILLUSTRATED POEM. By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Cloth. $1.50.

      "The Vagabonds" are a strolling fiddler and his dog. The fiddler
      has been ruined by drink, and his monologue is one of the most
      pathetic and effective pieces in our literature.

      Mr. Tomlinson, who knows the "ins and outs" of boy nature by heart,
      is one of the most entertaining and at the same time one of the
      instructive of living writers of juvenile fiction. In his younger
      days a teacher by profession, he has made boys and their
      idiosyncrasies the absorbing study of his life, and, with the
      accumulated experience of years to aid him, has applied himself to
      the task of preparing for their mental delectation a diet that
      shall be at once wholesome and attractive; and that his efforts in
      this laudable direction have been successful is conclusively proven
      by his popularity among boy readers.

      "'Under Dewey at Manila' is a thoroughly timely book, in perfect
      sympathy with the patriotism of the day. Its title is conducive to
      its perusing, and its reading to anticipation. For the volume is
      but the first of the Old Glory Series, and the imprint is that of
      the famed firm of Lee and Shepard, whose name has been for so many
      years linked with the publications of Oliver Optic. As a matter of
      fact, the story is right in line with the productions of that gifted
      and most fascinating of authors, and certainly there is every cause
      for congratulation that the stirring events of our recent war are
      not to lose their value for instruction through that valuable school
      which the late William T. Adams made so individually distinctive.

      "Edward Stratemeyer, who is the author of the present work, has
      proved an extraordinarily apt scholar, and had the book appeared
      anonymously there could hardly have failed of a unanimous opinion
      that a miracle had enabled the writer of the famous Army and Navy
      and other series to resume his pen for the volume in hand. Mr.
      Stratemeyer has acquired in a wonderfully successful degree the
      knack of writing an interesting educational story which will appeal
      to the young people, and the plan of his trio of books as outlined
      cannot fail to prove both interesting and valuable."--_Boston Ideas._

      "Stratemeyer's style suits the boys."--JOHN TERHUNE, _Supt. of
      Public Instruction, Bergen Co., New Jersey._

      "'The Young Volunteer in Cuba,' the second of the Old Glory Series,
      is better than the first; perhaps it traverses more familiar
      ground. Ben Russell, the brother of Larry, who was 'with Dewey,'
      enlists with the volunteers and goes to Cuba, where he shares in
      the abundance of adventure and has a chance to show his courage and
      honesty and manliness, which win their reward. A good book for boys,
      giving a good deal of information in a most attractive form."

      sustained his reputation as an entertaining, helpful, and
      instructive writer for boys."--_Philadelphia Call._

      "'Richard Dare's Venture,' by Edward Stratemeyer, tells the
      story of a country lad who goes to New York to earn enough to
      support his widowed mother and orphaned sisters. Richard's energy,
      uprightness of character, and good sense carry him through some
      trying experiences, and gain him friends."--_The Churchman_, New
      York.

      "It is such books as 'Richard Dare's Venture' that are calculated
      to inspire young readers with a determination to succeed in life,
      and to choose some honorable walk in which to find that success.
      The author, Edward Stratemeyer, has shown a judgment that is
      altogether too rare in the makers of books for boys, in that he
      has avoided that sort of heroics in the picturing of the life of
      his hero which deals in adventures of the daredevil sort. In that
      respect alone the book commends itself to the favor of parents who
      have a regard for the education of their sons, but the story is
      sufficiently enlivening and often thrilling to satisfy the
      healthful desires of the young reader."--_Kansas City Star._

      "Of standard writers of boys' stories there is quite a list, but

      "'The Last Cruise of the Spitfire' is of deep interest to the
      bounding heart of an enthusiastic boy. The book leaves a good
      impression on a boy's mind, as it teaches the triumph of noble
      deeds and true heroism."--_Kansas City_ (Mo.) _Times._

      "Let us mention in passing two admirable books for boys, 'Reuben
      Stone's Discovery' and 'Oliver Bright's Search,' by Edward
      Stratemeyer, with whom we are all acquainted. This last bit of his
      work is especially good, and the boy who gets one of these volumes
      will become very popular among his fellows until the book is worn
      threadbare."--_N. Y. Herald._

      "A good sea-tale for boys is 'The Last Cruise of the Spitfire,'
      by Edward Stratemeyer. There is plenty of adventure in it, a
      shipwreck, a cruise on a raft, and other stirring perils of the
      deep."--_Detroit_ (Mich.) _Journal._

      "In a simple, plain, straightforward manner, Mr. Edward
      Stratemeyer endeavors to show his boy readers what persistency,
      honesty, and willingness to work have accomplished for his young
      hero, and his moral is evident. Mr. Stratemeyer is very earnest
      and sincere in his portraiture of young character beginning to
      shape itself to weather against the future. A book of this sort is
      calculated to interest boys, to feed their ambition with hope, and
      to indicate how they must fortify themselves against the wiles of
      vice."--_Boston Herald._
