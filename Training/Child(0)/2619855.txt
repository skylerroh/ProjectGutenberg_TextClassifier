                    _Contents._

  The Two Voices, or the Shadow and the Shadowless. The Minute Fairies.
  I Have and O Had I. The Hump and Long Nose. The Lily Fairy and the
  Silver Beam. The Wonderful Watch. The Red and White Rose Trees.
  The Diamond Fountain. The Magical Key.

  Though this is a small book, it is, mechanically, exceedingly
  beautiful, being illustrated with spirited woodcuts from Original
  Designs. But that is its least merit. It is one of the most
  entertaining, and decidedly one of the best juveniles that have
  issued from the prolific press of this city. We speak advisedly.
  It is long since we found time to read through a juvenile book,
  so near Christmas, when the name of this class of volumes is
  legion; but this charmed us so much that we were unwilling to
  lay it down after once commencing it. The first story,--"The Two
  Voices, or the Shadow and the Shadowless,"--is a sweet thing, as
  is also the one entitled, "The Diamond Fountain." Indeed, the whole
  number, and there are ten, will be read with avidity. Their moral
  is as pure as their style is enchanting.--_Com. Adv_.
