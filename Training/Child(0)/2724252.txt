  =6. Down the Rhine=; OR, YOUNG AMERICA IN GERMANY.

        "The story from its inception, and through the
        twelve volumes (see Second Series), is a
        bewitching one, while the information imparted
        concerning the countries of Europe and the
        isles of the sea is not only correct in every
        particular, but is told in a captivating style.
        OLIVER OPTIC will continue to be the boys'
        friend, and his pleasant books will continue to
        be read by thousands of American boys. What a
        fine holiday present either or both series of
        'Young America Abroad' would be for a young
        friend! It would make a little library highly
        prized by the recipient, and would not be an
        expensive one."--_Providence Press._

        "OLIVER OPTIC is a _nom de plume_ that is known
        and loved by almost every boy of intelligence
        in the land. We have seen a highly intellectual
        and world-weary man, a cynic whose heart was
        somewhat embittered by its large experience of
        human nature, take up one of OLIVER OPTIC'S
        books, and read it at a sitting, neglecting his
        work in yielding to the fascination of the
        pages. When a mature and exceedingly
        well-informed mind, long despoiled of all its
        freshness, can thus find pleasure in a book for
        boys, no additional words of recommendation are
        needed."--_Sunday Times._

        "This is the latest series of books issued by
        this popular writer, and deals with life on the
        Great Lakes, for which a careful study was made
        by the author in a summer tour of the immense
        water sources of America. The story, which
        carries the same hero through the six books of
        the series, is always entertaining, novel
        scenes and varied incidents giving a constantly
        changing yet always attractive aspect to the
        narrative. OLIVER OPTIC has written nothing
        better."

        "The series has this peculiarity, that all of
        its constituent volumes are independent of one
        another, and therefore each story is complete
        in itself. OLIVER OPTIC is, perhaps, the
        favorite author of the boys and girls of this
        country, and he seems destined to enjoy an
        endless popularity. He deserves his success,
        for he makes very interesting stories, and
        inculcates none but the best sentiments, and
        the 'Yacht Club' is no exception to this
        rule."--_New Haven Journal and Courier._

        "Paul Farringford, the hero of these tales, is,
        like most of this author's heroes, a young man
        of high spirit, and of high aims and correct
        principles, appearing in the different volumes
        as a farmer, a captain, a bookkeeper, a
        soldier, a sailor, and a traveller. In all of
        them the hero meets with very exciting
        adventures, told in the graphic style for which
        the author is famous."

        "OLIVER OPTIC is one of the most fascinating
        writers for youth, and withal one of the best
        to be found in this or any past age. Troops of
        young people hang over his vivid pages; and not
        one of them ever learned to be mean, ignoble,
        cowardly, selfish, or to yield to any vice from
        anything they ever read from his
        pen."--_Providence Press._

        adventures of two brothers, Tom and Jack
        Somers, one in the army, the other in the navy,
        in the great Civil War. The romantic narratives
        of the fortunes and exploits of the brothers
        are thrilling in the extreme. Historical
        accuracy in the recital of the great events of
        that period is strictly followed, and the
        result is, not only a library of entertaining
        volumes, but also the best history of the Civil
        War for young people ever written."

        ownership of a boat pay. A great deal of useful
        information is given in this =Boat Builders
        Series=, and in each book a very interesting
        story is interwoven with the information. Every
        reader will be interested at once in Dory, the
        hero of 'All Adrift,' and one of the characters
        retained in the subsequent volumes of the
        series. His friends will not want to lose sight
        of him, and every boy who makes his
        acquaintance in 'All Adrift' will become his
        friend."

        children who are unable to comprehend the
        =Starry Flag Series= or the =Army and Navy

        talent for pleasing and interesting the little
        folks. They are all fresh and original,
        preaching no sermons, but inculcating good
        lessons.



=The Way of the World.= By OLIVER OPTIC. Illustrated. $1.50.

        "One of the most interesting American novels we
        have ever read."--_Philadelphia City Item._

        "This story treats of a fortune of three
        million dollars left a youthful heir. The
        volume bears evidence in every chapter of the
        fresh, original, and fascinating style which
        has always enlivened Mr. ADAMS' productions. We
        have the same felicitous manner of working out
        the plot by conversation, the same quaint wit
        and humor, and a class of characters which
        stand out boldly, pen photographs of living
        beings.

        "The book furnishes a most romantic and withal
        a most instructive illustration of the way of
        the world in its false estimate of money."


=Living too Fast=; OR, THE CONFESSIONS OF A BANK OFFICER. By OLIVER
OPTIC. Illustrated. $1.50.

        This story records the experience of a bank
        officer in the downward career of crime. The
        career ought, perhaps, to have ended in the
        State's prison; but the author chose to
        represent the defaulter as sharply punished in
        another way. The book contains a most valuable
        lesson; and shows, in another leading
        character, the true life which a young business
        man ought to lead.


=In Doors and Out=; OR, VIEWS FROM A CHIMNEY CORNER. By OLIVER OPTIC.
Illustrated. $1.50.

        "Many who have not time and patience to wade
        through a long story will find here many pithy
        and sprightly tales, each sharply hitting some
        social absurdity or social vice. We recommend
        the book heartily after having read the three
        chapters on 'Taking a Newspaper.' If all the
        rest are as sensible and interesting as these,
        and doubtless they are, the book is well worthy
        of patronage."--_Vermont Record._

        "As a writer of domestic stories, Mr. WILLIAM
        T. ADAMS (OLIVER OPTIC) made his mark even
        before he became so immensely popular through
        his splendid books for the young. In the volume
        before us are given several of these tales, and
        they comprise a book which will give them a
        popularity greater than they have ever before
        enjoyed. They are written in a spirited style,
        impart valuable practical lessons, and are of
        the most lively interest."--_Boston Home
        Journal._


=Our Standard Bearer.= A Life of Gen. U. S. Grant. By OLIVER OPTIC.
Illustrated by THOMAS NAST. Illuminated covers, $1.50.

        It has long been out of print, but now comes
        out in a new edition, with a narrative of the
        civil career of the General as President for
        two terms, his remarkable journey abroad, his
        life in New York, and his sickness, death, and
        burial. Perhaps the reader will remember that
        the narrative is told by "Captain Galligasken"
        after a style that is certainly not common or
        tiresome, but, rather, in a direct, simple,
        picturesque, and inspiring way that wins the
        heart of the young reader. For the boy who
        wants to read the life of General Grant, this
        book is the best that has been
        published,--perhaps the only one that is worth
        any consideration.


=Just His Luck.= By OLIVER OPTIC. Illustrated. $1.00.

        "It deals with real flesh and blood boys; with
        boys who possess many noble qualities of mind;
        with boys of generous impulses and large
        hearts; with boys who delight in playing
        pranks, and who are ever ready for any sort of
        mischief; and with boys in whom human nature is
        strongly engrafted. They are boys, as many of
        us have been; boys in the true, unvarnished
        sense of the word; boys with hopes, ideas, and
        inspirations, but lacking in judgment,
        self-control, and discipline. And the book
        contains an appropriate moral, teaches many a
        lesson, and presents many a precept worthy of
        being followed. It is a capital book for boys."

=THE START IN LIFE SERIES. 4 volumes.=

=A Start in Life=: A STORY OF THE GENESEE COUNTRY. By J. T. TROWBRIDGE.
Illustrated. $1.00.

        In this story the author recounts the hardships
        of a young lad in his first endeavor to start
        out for himself. It is a tale that is full of
        enthusiasm and budding hopes. The writer shows
        how hard the youths of a century ago were
        compelled to work. This he does in an
        entertaining way, mingling fun and adventures
        with their daily labors. The hero is a striking
        example of the honest boy, who is not too lazy
        to work, nor too dull to thoroughly appreciate
        a joke.


=Biding His Time=. By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. Illustrated. $1.00.

        "It is full of spirit and adventure, and
        presents a plucky hero who was willing to 'bide
        his time,' no matter how great the expectations
        that he indulged in from his uncle's vast
