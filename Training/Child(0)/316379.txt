FOX. Good-morning, Peter.

PETER. What do you want, sir?

FOX. I am hungry. I want to eat Jacob's chickens.

PETER. Ah, that is fine! I do not like Jacob. Do you know that?

FOX. Oh, yes, I know! Now will you help me to get his chickens?

PETER. What can I do?

FOX. Put meal on me, till I am white. Then the chickens will think I am
a miller.

PETER. Ah, that is fine! I will get meal. Wait here.

[_Peter enters the mill._]

FOX. Ha, ha, ha, ha!

[PETER _comes with a pan of meal._]

[Illustration]

PETER. Now I will make you white. You shall look just like a miller.

(_He covers the Fox with meal._)

Ha, ha! Jacob's chickens will think you
are Jacob. Now go! Go and eat Jacob's chickens.

(_The Fox goes._)

Ah, this is fine! I do not like Jacob. I do not like Jacob's chickens. I
am glad the fox will eat them. Ha, ha, ha!

[_Peter enters the mill. Soon his_ WIFE _comes running._]

WIFE. Peter! Peter! Come out! Come out! Peter!

[PETER _comes running from the mill._]

PETER. What is it? What is it?

WIFE. The fox has killed your chickens!

PETER. Oh, no! He has killed Jacob's chickens, dear wife. Ha, ha, ha!

WIFE. No, no! He has killed your chickens! They lie there on the grass.
Look and you will see them.

[_Peter runs to the fence and looks over._]

PETER. What is this? What is this? Ah, my pretty chickens! My pretty
chickens!

[_He weeps bitterly._]

JACOB. What do you want, sir?

FOX. I am hungry. I want to eat Peter's chickens.

JACOB. Why do you come to me?

FOX. You do not like Peter.

JACOB. Oh, you know that, do you?

FOX. Oh, yes, I know! Now will you help me to get his chickens?

JACOB. What can I do?

Fox. Put meal on me, till I am white. Then the chickens will think I am
a miller.

JACOB. Ah, that is fine! Wait here.

[_He enters the mill._]

FOX. He has gone for meal! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

[JACOB _comes out with a club._]

JACOB. Now go! Go, sir!

FOX. Why, what is this? I said I would eat Peter's chickens.

JACOB. Yes, but you mean to eat mine. Now go! Go, or I will beat you!

OLD JACKDAW. Come, jackdaws! We must have our breakfast. Come!

[_The Vain Jackdaw stops to look at something on the ground._]

(_To Vain Jackdaw._)

Come, no one should stop to look at anything! Come!

YOUNG JACKDAW. Just look at him. He takes up feathers!

VAIN JACKDAW (_to himself_). How fine I would look in these peacock
feathers!

ANOTHER JACKDAW. See how he sticks the feathers in among his own!

YOUNG JACKDAW. See how he struts about in them!

OLD JACKDAW. My son, take off those feathers!

VAIN JACKDAW. It pleases me to wear them.

OLD JACKDAW. Take them off, I say!

VAIN JACKDAW. I will not take them off!

OLD JACKDAW. Then you cannot stay with us.

VAIN JACKDAW. I do not wish to stay with jackdaws. I will not walk with
jackdaws. I will not talk with jackdaws. I think myself too fine for
jackdaws.

OLD JACKDAW. Then, jackdaws, we will think no more about him. Come, now,
to find our breakfast! Come!

[_They go. The_ PEACOCKS _enter._]

PEACOCKS. Ha, ha, ha!

VAIN JACKDAW. Why do you laugh so, brothers?

PEACOCKS. Ha, ha, ha!

VAIN JACKDAW. You must not laugh, dear brothers. I am a peacock like
yourselves.

FIRST PEACOCK. You silly jackdaw!

VAIN JACKDAW. I am no jackdaw. Do I not have feathers like your own?

SECOND PEACOCK. Ha, ha! I dropped them on the ground this morning.

THIBAUD PEACOCK. Let's take them from him!

[_The jackdaw runs. The peacocks go, laughing. The other_ JACKDAWS
_enter, followed by the_ VAIN JACKDAW.]

VAIN JACKDAW. Ah, here you are! I have been looking for you.

OLD JACKDAW. Why do you look for us?

VAIN JACKDAW. I am a jackdaw. I want to be with jackdaws.

OLD JACKDAW. We will have nothing more to do with you! Away!

VAIN JACKDAW. But, brothers, my dear, dear brothers, please let me stay
with you!

[_The_ JACKAL _stands on the river bank. He looks longingly toward the
west shore._]

JACKAL. Ah, if I could only get at those crabs over there! It makes me
hungry just to see them! Now if I could only swim! Or if I could walk on
water! Or if I had a little canoe!

[_Enter the_ CAMEL. _The Jackal whispers to himself._]

Aha! Now I know the way to get across.

(_To the Camel._)

Such news as I have for you, dear friend!

CAMEL. Must I guess?

JACKAL. No, I'll tell you this time. Listen: I know a spot where the
sugar-cane grows thick.

CAMEL. Tell me! I cannot wait! Tell me!

JACKAL. I cannot. I'll have to show you. It is on the other side of the
river.

CAMEL. Why, then, I'll swim across and take you on my back.

JACKAL. Just the very thing!

CAMEL. Come, then! It makes me hungry just to hear of sugar-cane.

[_He kneels for the Jackal to get upon his back._]

[_The_ CAMEL _eats the sugar-cane. The_ JACKAL _comes running into the
field._]

CAMEL. What! Have you finished your crabs?

JACKAL. I cannot eat another one! Are you not ready to go?

CAMEL. Ready! Why, I have just begun.

JACKAL. I'll wait for you outside the field, then.

[_The Camel nods and disappears among the cane._]

Now I do not wish to wait for him. I am in a hurry to get home, I am. So
I'll sing a little song I know. The farmer then will come and drive the
camel out.

[_He goes. Soon he is heard singing in the distance. Enter the_ FARMER
_and_ the BOYS _with clubs._]

FARMER. I see no jackal here!

A BOY. I am sure I heard him singing!

ANOTHER BOY. I heard him, too!

FARMER. We must look for him and drive him out.

[_The_ CAMEL _enters, eating cane._]

FIRST BOY. Look, look! A camel!

SECOND BOY. Look, father! A camel!

FARMER (_to Camel_). So it was you who was singing, was it? Drive him
out, boys! Quick! Beat him with your clubs!

[_They rush upon the Camel and beat him as he runs from the field._]

JACKAL.]

JACKAL. Are you ready to go now, friend?

CAMEL. Don't say "friend" to me!

JACKAL. Why do you speak so strangely?

CAMEL. Why did you sing so strangely?

[Illustration]

JACKAL. Oh, I don't know why! I always sing after dinner.

CAMEL. Ah! Well, let us go.

[_He kneels. The Jackal gets on his back. The Camel rises and enters the
river. He swims to the middle of the river and stops._]

JACKAL. Why do you stop?

CAMEL. I have such a strange, strange feeling.

JACKAL. Well, swim on. You need not stop!

CAMEL. I feel as if I must roll over.

JACKAL. Roll over! If you do, I shall be drowned!

CAMEL. Exactly. But still I have that feeling.

JACKAL. Now that is nonsense! Why should you roll over?

CAMEL. Oh, I don't know why! I always roll over after dinner.

[_He rolls over._]
