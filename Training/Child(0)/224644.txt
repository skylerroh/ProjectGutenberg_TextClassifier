    Came down too soon,
  And ask'd his way to Norwich;
    He went by the south,
    And burnt his mouth
  With eating cold plum-porridge.

  Little Jack Horner
    Sat in a corner,
  Eating a Christmas pie;
    He put in his thumb
    And pull'd out a plum,
  And said, "What a brave boy am I!"




  See-saw, sacaradown,
  Which is the way to London town?
  One foot up, the other foot down,
  That is the way to London town.




  One, two, buckle my shoe;
  Three, four, shut the door;
  Five, six, pick up sticks;
  Seven, eight, lay them straight;
  Nine, ten, a good fat hen;
  Eleven, twelve, who will delve?
  Thirteen, fourteen, draw the curtain;
  Fifteen, sixteen, the maid's in the kitchen;
  Seventeen, eighteen, she's a-waiting;
  Nineteen, twenty, my plate's empty;
  Please, mamma, give me some dinner.

  Ride a cock-horse to Banbury Cross,
  To see an old woman ride on a white horse,
  With rings on her fingers and bells on her toes,
  And she shall have music wherever she goes.




  There was an old woman lived under a hill,
  And if she ben't gone she lives there still.




  1. This little pig went to market;
  2. This little pig stayed at home;
  3. This little pig had roast meat;
  4. This little pig had none;
  5. This little pig said, "Wee, wee, wee,
        I can't find my way home!"

[* * *] Addressed to the five toes.




  The girl in the lane,
  That couldn't speak plain,
    Cried gobble, gobble,
        Gobble:
  The man on the hill,
  That couldn't stand still,
    Went hobble, hobble,
        Hobble.

  Bah, bah, black sheep,
    Have you any wool?
  Yes, marry, have I,
    Three bags full:
  One for my master,
    And one for my dame,
  And one for the little boy
    Who lives in the lane.




  A Dillar a dollar,
  A ten o'clock scholar,
  What makes you come so soon?
  You used to come at ten o'clock,
  But now you come at noon.




[Illustration]

  One, two, three, four, five,
  I caught a hare alive;
  Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
  And let it go again.

  Hark! hark! the dogs do bark,
    Beggars are coming to town,
  Some in jags, and some in rags,
    And some in velvet gown.




  Four little mice sat down to spin,
  Pussy pass'd by and she peep'd in;
  "What are you at, my fine little men?"
  "Making coats for gentlemen."
  "Shall I come in, and cut off your thread?"
  "No! no! Miss Pussy, you'll bite off our head."




  To market, to market, to buy a plum bun.
  Home again, home again, market is done.




  There was a piper who had a cow,
    But he had no hay to give her;
  So he took his pipes and played a tune,
    Consider, old cow, consider!

  There was an old woman
  Who lived in a shoe,
  She had so many children
  She didn't know what to do;
  She gave them some broth
  Without any bread,
  She whipp'd them all soundly
  And sent them to bed.




  Lady-bird, lady-bird,
  Fly away home,
  Your house is on fire,
  Your children will burn.




  Rain, rain,
    Go away,
  Come again
    Another day,
  Little Harry
    Wants to play.




  The man in the wilderness asked me
  How many strawberries grew in the sea?
  I answered him, as I thought good,
  As many red herrings as grew in the wood.




  Hiccory, diccory, dock,
  The mouse ran up the clock;
  The clock struck one,
  The mouse ran down,
    Hiccory, diccory, dock.




  Daffy-down-dilly has come up to town,
  In a yellow petticoat and a green gown.




  Hey, my kitten, my kitten,
    And hey, my kitten, my deary,
  Such a sweet pet as this
    Was neither far nor neary.




  Hey diddle diddle,
    The cat and the fiddle,
  The cow jump'd over the moon;
    The little dog laugh'd
    To see such craft,
  And the dish ran away with the spoon.

  Jack and Jill
  Went up the hill
  To fetch a
  Pail of water;
  Jack fell down
  And cracked
  His crown,
  And Jill came
  Tumbling after.




  Two little dogs were basking in the cinders;
  Two little cats were playing in the windows;
  When two little mice popped out of a hole,
  And up to a fine piece of cheese they stole.
  The two little dogs cried, "Cheese is nice!"
  But the two little cats jumped down in a trice,
  And cracked the bones of the two little mice.




  Wee Willie Winkie
    Runs through the town,
  Up stairs and down stairs,
    In his night-gown;
  Tapping at the window,
    Crying at the lock,
  "Are the babes in their bed?
    For it's now ten o'clock."




[Illustration]

  Little boy blue, come blow me your horn,
  The sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in the corn;
  Where is the little boy tending the sheep?
  Under the haycock fast asleep.




  Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, where have you been?
  I've been to London to see the queen.
  Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, what did you there?
  I frightened a little mouse under the chair.




  High diddle doubt, my candle's out,
    And my little dame's not at home:
  So saddle my hog, and bridle my dog,
    And fetch my little dame home.

  As I was going up Pippen Hill,
    Pippen Hill was dirty,
  There I met a pretty miss,
    And she dropp'd me a curtsey.

[Illustration]

  Little miss, pretty miss!
    Blessings light upon you!
  If I had half-a-crown a-day,
    I'd spend it all upon you.




  I had a little husband, no bigger than my thumb,
  I put him in a pint-pot, and there I bid him drum;
  I bought him a little handkerchief to wipe his little nose,
  And a pair of little garters, to tie his little hose.




  There was a little boy went into a barn,
    And lay down on some hay;
  An owl came out and flew about,
    And the little boy ran away.




    I'll sing you a song,
    It's not very long:
  The woodcock and the sparrow,
