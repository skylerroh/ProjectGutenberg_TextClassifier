A BALLAD OF HEROES

    Because you passed, and now are not,--
      Because in some remoter day
    Your sacred dust from doubtful spot
      Was blown of ancient airs away,--
      Because you perished,--must men say
    Your deeds were naught, and so profane
      Your lives with that cold burden? Nay,
      The deeds you wrought are not in vain!

    Though, it may be above the plot
      That hid your once imperial clay,
    No greener than o'er men forgot
      The unregarded grasses sway,--
      Though there no sweeter is the lay
    From careless bird,--though you remain
      Without distinction of decay,--
      The deeds you wrought are not in vain!

    No. For while yet in tower or cot
      Your story stirs the pulse's play;
    And men forget the sordid lot--
      The sordid care, of cities gray;--
      While yet, beset in homelier fray,
    They learn from you the lesson plain
      That life may go, so Honor stay,--
      The deeds you wrought are not in vain!

    ENVOY

    Heroes of old! I humbly lay
      The laurel on your graves again;
    Whatever men have done, men may,--
      The deeds you wrought are not in vain!

    AUSTIN DOBSON.
