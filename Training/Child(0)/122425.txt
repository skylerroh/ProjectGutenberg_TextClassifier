15 Joe made up a game which he called "Jac-alack." One person called Jack

21 If I were writing about the rich, I should be inclined to divide them,

23 A whale is not a fish, even though it does live in water. A fish has no

24 The brook on our farm has many whims. It ripples over bright and shiny

25 To pant for recognition, to yearn to impress one's personality upon
   one's fellow-men, is the essence of ambition. The ambitious person may
   think that he merely thirsts to "do something" or "be somebody" but
   really what he craves is to figure potently in the minds of others, to
   be greatly loved, admired, or feared. To reap a success which no one
   .................. does not satisfy the yearnings of the

26 Washington was a very silent man. Of no man in the world's history do

28 Fundamentally, education depends upon the capacity of a person to
   profit by past experiences. Past situations modify present and future
   adjustments. Education in its broadest sense means acquiring
   experiences that serve to.................. existing inherited or
   acquired tendencies of behavior.

29 "Naive" and "unsophisticated" are frequently confused. The former
   suggests a type of behavior which is artless, spontaneous, and free
   from the restraints of custom. The latter implies fully as great lack
   of knowledge of social usage, and, in addition, conduct which is
   primitive and perchance inelegant. Thus, the.................. youth
   was the first to enter the car, and his.................. little
   sister warmly kissed him in the presence of the king. We may also say

   customs.
