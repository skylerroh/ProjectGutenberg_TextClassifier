[Transcriber's Note:

Welcome to the schoolroom of 1900. The moral tone is plain.
"She is kind to the old blind man."

The exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful than some
contemporary alternatives. Much is left to the teacher. Explanations given
in the text are enough to get started teaching a child to read and write.
Counting in Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson
numbers.

The form of contractions includes a space. The contemporary word "don't"
was rendered as "do n't".

The author, not listed in the text, is William Holmes McGuffey.

Passages using non-ASCI characters are approximately rendered in this text
version. See the PDF or DOC versions for the original images.

The section numbers are decimal in the Table of Contents but are in
Roman Numerals in the body.

Page headings are removed, but section titles are followed by the page on
which they appear.

In revising the FOURTH READER, the aim has been--as it has with the other
books of the Series--to preserve unimpaired all the essential
characteristics of MCGUFFEY'S READERS. New articles have been substituted
for old ones only where the advantage was manifest.

The book has been considerably enlarged, and has been liberally
illustrated by the first artists of the country.

It can not be presumed that every pupil has at hand all the works of
reference necessary for the proper preparation of each lesson; hence all
the aids that seem requisite to this purpose have been given. Brief
notices concerning the various authors represented have been inserted; the
more difficult words have been defined, and their pronunciation has been
indicated by diacritical marks; and short explanatory notes have been
given wherever required for a full understanding of the text.

Especial acknowledgment is due to Messrs. Houghton, Osgood & Co. for their
permission to make liberal selections from their copyright editions of
many of the foremost American author whose works they publish.

PUNCTUATION MARKS. (7)

1. The Hyphen (-) is used between syllables and between the parts of a
compound word; as, No-ble, col-o-ny, and text- book, easy-chair.

2. The Comma (,), the Semicolon (;), and the Colon (:) denote grammatical
divisions.

NOTE--These marks do not indicate the comparative length of the pauses to
be made where they occur.

3. The Period (.) is placed at the end of a sentence. It is also used
after an abbreviation; as, God is love. Dr. Eben Goodwin.

4. The Interrogation point (?) denotes a question; as, Has he come? Who
are you?

5. The Exclamation point (!) denotes strong feeling; as, Oh Absaom! my
son! my son!

6. Quotation marks (" ") denote the words of another; as, God said, "Let
there be light."

7. The Apostrophe (') denotes that a letter or letters are left out; as,
O'er, for over; 't is, for it is. It also denotes the possessive case; as,
John's hat.

8. The Curves ( ) include what, if omitted, would not obscure the sense.
The parenthesis, or words included by the curves, should be read in a low
key, and with greater rapidity than the rest of the sentence.

9. Brackets [ ] include something intended to exemplify what goes before,
or to supply some deficiency, or rectify some mistake.

10. A Dash (-) denotes a long or significant pause, or an abrupt change or
transition in a sentence.

11. Marks of Ellipsis (***) indicate the omission of
letters of a word, or words of a sentence; as, P * * * * e
J**n, for Prince John; the ******* was hung, for the traitor was hung.

Sometimes a long line, or a succession of dots is used instead of stars;
as, J--n A---s, for John Adams; the D..e W.....m, for the Duke William.

12. A Brace (}) is used to connect several lines or words together.

13. A Diaeresis  is put over the latter of two vowels, to show that they
belong to two distinct syllables; thus, cooperate.

14. A Section is used to divide a discourse or chapter into parts.

15. An Index points out something that requires particular attention.

16. A Paragraph denotes a new subject. It is used in the common version of
the Bible.

17. Certain marks and sometimes figures and letters are used to refer to
some remark in the margin.

18. A Caret (^) is used in writing, to show that some-thing is omitted;
as,  Manner. I love her for her modesty and virtue.


ARTICULATION. (9)

ELEMENTARY SOUNDS

Articulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds of a language, and
of their combinations.

An Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound made by the organs of
speech.

The Elementary Sounds of the English language are divided into Vocals,
Subvocals, and Aspirates.

Vocals are those sounds which consist of pure tone only. They are the most
prominent elements of speech. A diphthong is a union of two vocals,
commencing with one and ending with the other.

Subvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath is more or less
obstructed.

Aspirates consist of breath only, modified by the vocal organs.


VOCALS.

DIRECTIONS FOR ARTICULATION.

1. Let the mouth be open, and the teeth, tongue, and palate in their
proper position.

2. Pronounce the word in the CHART forcibly, and with the falling
inflection, several times in succession; then drop the subvocal or
aspirate sounds which precede or follow the vocal, and repeat the vocals
alone.

a       pass    u       tube

REMARK.--In this table, the short sounds, except u, are nearly or quite
the same, in quality, as certain of the long sounds. The difference
consists chiefly in quantity. As a rule, the long vocals should be
prolonged with a full, clear utterance; but the short vocals should be
uttered sharply and almost explosively.

Diphthongs.

oi, oy, as in coin, boy.        ou, ow, as in noun, now.


SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES.

DIRECTIONS FOR ARTICULATION.

Pronounce distinctly and forcibly, several times in succession, words in
which these sounds occur as elements; then drop the other sounds, and
repeat the subvocals and aspirates alone. Each subvocal in the first table
should be practiced in connection with its cognate sound.

Let the class repeat the words and elements, at first in concert; then
separately.

Select words ending with subvocal sounds for practice on subvocals; words
beginning or ending with aspirate sounds, for practice on aspirates.


COGNATE SOUNDS.

Sound  Example          Sound   Example
b      babe             p       rap

g      fog              k       book
j      judge            ch      chat

th     them             th      myth
z      buzz             s       sink
zh     azure            sh      shine
w      win              wh      when


REMARK.--These eighteen sounds make nine pairs of cognate sounds. In
articulating the aspirates, the vocal organs are put in the position as
required for the articulation of the corresponding subvocals; but the
breath is expelled with some force, without the utterance of any vocal
sound. Let the pupil verify this by experiment, and then practice on these
cognates.

The following sounds are not cognates.
