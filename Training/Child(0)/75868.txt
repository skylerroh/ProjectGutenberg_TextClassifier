   While position and fashion they frantically clutch.

   What else do they live for, our girls so refined,
   So forward, precocious, and gifted at ten
   They are flirting and courting and things of the kind,
   That never came under our grandmother's ken.

   At fifteen so dressed up, and hooped up, I ween,
   They're mothers full often before they're sixteen,
   And fading and dowdy and sickly at twenty,
   With one boy in trowsers and two girls in laces
   Complaining of starving while dying of plenty
   The fate is of ladies in fashionable places.




He Imploreth Mercy upon those condemned with fashionable folly to Marry, and Illustrateth their Condition.


   Now heaven in mercy be kind to the wretch,
   Who marries for money or fashion or folly;
   He'd better accept of the noose of Jack Ketch
   Than such a "help-meet;" or at once marry Dolly
   The cook, or with Bridget, the maid of the broom;
   With one he'd be sure to get coffee and meat,
   And never hear whining of nothing to eat,
   And 't other would make up his bed and his room;
   And if he was blest with a child now and then,
   As happens sometimes with your fashionable wives,
   Who're coupled to bipeds, in nature called men,
   He'd need no insurance to warrant their lives;
   And need no expense of a grand "bridal tour,"
   Or visit each season at "watering places,"
   Where fashion at people well known to be poor,
   In money or station, will make ugly faces;
   Where women, though married, with roues will flirt;
   Where widows, though widows in fresh sable weeds,
   Spread nets that entangle like old Nessus' shirt
   And finish with Burdell and Cunningham deeds;
   Where daughters when fading are taken to spend
   A month at the springs, or a week in salt water;
   Where bachelors flirting on Ellen attend,
   Are whispered by mamma, "engaged to my daughter."




He Imploreth Merry for other Unfortunate Beings.


   Now heaven in mercy be kind to the wretches
   Who stay on the earth like this Mrs. Merdle!

   More wretched than ever a wretch on the hurdle
   Was drawn by all England's official Jack Ketches;
   More wretched, if can be, at church on a Sunday
   A woman, who worships, than God, more her dress,
   Would be if she heard or e'en thought Mrs. Grundy
   Would sneer at the set of a bonnet or tress;
   Or say that she thought Miss Freelove's new pattern
   Of laces, or collars, or yard flowing sleeves,
   Looked more like the dress of a real Miss Slattern
   And not "so becoming"'s the first one of Eve's.




He Discourseth of a Common Prayer.


   Yet look at the thousands whose every day prayer,
   Far more than their own or their neighbor's salvation,
   Absorbs every thought, every dream, and all care,
   "To eat or to wear, is anything new in creation?"




He Discourseth of Trouble and Sorrow.


   What else do they live for? They live but for this;
   And nothing but this ever troubles their thinking;
   Rich eating, rich dressing, and flirting's their bliss,
   And life's better purposes constantly blinking.

   Their life's but a tissue of trouble and sorrow
   Of what is the fashion or will be to-morrow.




He Moralizeth upon what a Day may Bring forth.


   "To-morrow!" who'll warrant to-morrow we'll see?

   Who'll care the next day or day after for dinner?

   Or what the next fashion of new dress will be?

   Or who Mrs. Grundy will say is the winner?

   Having reached Thirtysixthly, the Author is
   about to Make the "Application," and Pray
   forgiveness, but concludes by remaining Incog.

   "Who'll care for, to-morrow, for this bit of scandal,
   With malice prepense that a cynic has written?

   (That's what they will say when the poem they handle,
   Who feel 'tis themselves whom the mad dog has bitten;
   And wish he was treated as dogs with the rabies
   Are treated, to stop his unmannerly bark;
   Or packed off to bed as you do naughty babies,
   To sleep, or be frightened all alone in the dark.)

   Who'll care? why the author of this ugly poem--
   He'll care--for a reason--that all of you read it--
   He'll care for the cash you'll give--Oh! how he needs it--
   (Oh! what would you give, ladies dear, just to know him?--)

   But that, by your leave, by the aid of the elf
   The printer employs, he will keep to himself.

   He knows, if you knew him, what fate he would meet;
   At every table you'd give him--nothing to eat.

   Excuse then, dear ladies, the author his shyness,
   And accept his conge at the end of this

   FINIS.
