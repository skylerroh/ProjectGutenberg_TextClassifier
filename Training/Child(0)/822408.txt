PARTRIDGE AND YOUNG.


One afternoon, while walking across a meadow, near a village, I saw a
dog of the terrier breed pursuing a partridge, which every now and then
turned and made at it with its wings down, then rolled over, then ran,
and again rushed at the dog. I drove the dog away, when I was surprised
to see a number of young partridges running from behind the old bird who
had been trying to protect them from the dog, and guarding their
retreat. So you see how brave the most timid creatures become when in
danger, and when their young are near. Instinct tells them that they
have to protect their little ones, and risk everything, even their own
lives, for their safety. We can get beautiful lessons every day from the
birds and poor dumb animals, if we only study them as we ought.

THE KINGFISHERS' HOME.


Very pretty birds were Mr. and Mrs. Kingfisher, with dark, glossy, green
wings, spotted with light blue. Their tails were also light blue, and
there was a patch of yellow near their heads. The little Kingfishers
were quite as pretty as their parents, and Mr. and Mrs. Kingfisher were
exceedingly proud of them.

"Only they eat a great deal," said Mr. Kingfisher; "I am getting very
tired."

For Mr. Kingfisher had been flying backward and forward all day, and it
was surprising to see the quantity of fish he caught for his family.

When he built his nest he took care that it should be near a stream, and
he found one close by a high cliff that Mrs. Kingfisher said would be
just the place; so they scooped out a deep hole, and there the eggs were
laid, and in due time six little Kingfishers burst out of the shells.

RATS CARRYING EGGS UP STAIRS.


Rats are very ingenious little creatures; they have actually been known
to convey eggs up a staircase, from the pantry to their nest! Here is a
beautiful picture, by Mr. Harrison Weir, from the "Children's Friend,"
showing how they did it.

The rat bears little resemblance to the rats with which we are chiefly
acquainted, namely, the black rat, the albino or white rat, and the
brown rat. The other day, as I was walking by the river-side, I saw a
beautiful little creature sitting on a stone in the stream, with a piece
of succulent root between its forepaws, and nibbling its repast in
perfect peace with every living thing. It was timid and innocent in the
expression of its countenance. Its color was of a reddish brown. It was
about as large as the common rat of the sewers, but its tail was much
shorter, and covered with hair.

A HERON ATTACKED BY A HAWK.


The Heron when attacked by an eagle or falcon endeavors to escape by
rising in the air and getting above its foe. The wings of the heron
strike the air with an equal and regular motion which raises its body to
such an elevation that at a distance nothing is seen except the wings,
which are at last lost sight of in the region of the clouds.

If its enemy gets above it, and upon or near its body, it defends itself
vigorously with its long and powerful beak, and often comes off
victorious.

The heron frequents the neighborhood of rivers and lakes. Almost always
solitary, it remains for hours motionless on the same spot. When seeking
the fish or frogs on which it chiefly feeds, the heron wades into the
water, folds its long neck partially over its back and forward again,
and with watchful eye waits till a fish comes within reach of its beak,
when it darts its head into the water and secures its slimy, slippery
prey.

A HORSE GUARDIAN.


On one occasion a gentleman was returning home from a fatiguing journey,
and became very drowsy. He fell asleep, and, strange to say, he also
fell from his saddle, but in so easy a manner that the tumble did not
rouse him, and lay sleeping on where he alighted. His faithful steed, on
being eased of his burden, instead of scampering home as one might have
expected, stood by his prostrate master, and kept a strict watch over
him. Some laborers at sunrise found him very contentedly snoozing on a
heap of stones. They wished to approach the gentleman, that they might
awaken him, but every attempt on their part was resolutely opposed by
the grinning teeth and ready heels of his determined and faithful
guardian. They called out loudly, and the gentleman awoke and was very
much surprised at his position, while his faithful horse showed his
pleasure by neighing and scraping his feet on the ground. The gentleman
then mounted, and they galloped away at great speed, both glad to be
able to make up for lost time.

BATTLE BETWEEN A FOX AND A SWAN.


A fierce battle between a fox and a swan took place at Sherborne Park.
Master Reynard seems to have caught the old swan napping, and to have
seized him by the throat. The bird defended himself with his wings so
powerfully that its assailant was done to death in no time, and a
workman going past the lake above the bridge next morning found both fox
and swan lying dead together. The bird had received a fatal bite in the
throat; the fox had one leg broken and the side of its head completely
broken in. The swan was the oldest bird on the lake.

TOUSY.


We have a beautiful long-haired little dog called Tousy, which lately
had a pup. This queer little bantling was jumping and tumbling about the
green one day, when a lady entered followed by a dog. Tousy made a
ferocious assault on the four-footed stranger, by way of defending her
young, and our magnificent white cat, which was sitting on the doorstep,
seeing or supposing that his friend Tousy was in danger, made two
immense bounds, and alighted on the back of the intruder, whose eyes
would have been scratched out but for prompt rescue. The mutual
affection of these two animals is unbounded, and yet we hear human
disagreements compared to cat-and-dog life! These animals, and many
others, are capable of the most devoted affection to their young, and to
their mates, and frequently teach us lessons of kindness to one
another.
