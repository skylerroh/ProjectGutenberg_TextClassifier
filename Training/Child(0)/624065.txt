      There are four angels there.
    Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
      God bless the bed that I lay on."

The Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John rhymes were well known in Essex in
Elizabeth's time. Ady, in his "Candle after dark," 1655, mentions an old
woman he knew, who had lived from Queen Mary's time, and who had been
taught by the priests in those days many Popish charms. The old woman,
amongst other rhymes, repeated--

    "Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
      The bed be blest that I lay on."

This was to be repeated yearly, thrice on Twelfth Night, and it would
act as a charm until the following year against evil spirits.

In 1601 a charm in general esteem against lightning was a laurel leaf.

    "Reach the bays" (or laurel leaves), "and wear one."
      "I'll tie a garland here about his head,
      'Twill keep my boy from lightning."

Even Tiberius Caesar wore a chaplet of laurel leaves about his neck.
Pliny reported that "laurel leaves were never blasted by lightning."

        crown.
    The greatest drunkards in the town are very, very glad that malt's
        come down."

In New York the children have a common saying when making a swop or
