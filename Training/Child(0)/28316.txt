FASHION NOTES

Necklaces of roseberries are very much worn now.

It is considered smart to wear your school hat tilted over your left
eye.

Bangs are coming in. Em Frewen has them. She went to Summerside for a
visit and came back with them. All the girls in school are going to bang
their hair as soon as their mothers will let them. But I do not intend
to bang mine.

Old Mr. McIntyre's son on the Markdale Road had been very sick for
several years and somebody was sympathizing with him because his son was
going to die. "Oh," Mr. McIntyre said, quite easy, "he might as weel be
awa'. He's only retarding buzziness."

CHAPTER XXXII. OUR LAST EVENING TOGETHER


IT was the evening before the day on which the Story Girl and Uncle
Blair were to leave us, and we were keeping our last tryst together
in the orchard where we had spent so many happy hours. We had made a
pilgrimage to all the old haunts--the hill field, the spruce wood, the
dairy, Grandfather King's willow, the Pulpit Stone, Pat's grave, and
Uncle Stephen's Walk; and now we foregathered in the sere grasses about
the old well and feasted on the little jam turnovers Felicity had made
that day specially for the occasion.

"I wonder if we'll ever all be together again," sighed Cecily.

"I wonder when I'll get jam turnovers like this again," said the Story
Girl, trying to be gay but not making much of a success of it.

"If Paris wasn't so far away I could send you a box of nice things
now and then," said Felicity forlornly, "but I suppose there's no use
thinking of that. Dear knows what they'll give you to eat over there."

"Oh, the French have the reputation of being the best cooks in the
world," rejoined the Story Girl, "but I know they can't beat your jam
turnovers and plum puffs, Felicity. Many a time I'll be hankering after
them."

"If we ever do meet again you'll be grown up," said Felicity gloomily.

"Well, you won't have stood still yourselves, you know."

"No, but that's just the worst of it. We'll all be different and
everything will be changed."

"Just think," said Cecily, "last New Year's Eve we were wondering what
would happen this year; and what a lot of things have happened that we
never expected. Oh, dear!"

"If things never happened life would be pretty dull," said the Story
Girl briskly. "Oh, don't look so dismal, all of you."

"It's hard to be cheerful when everybody's going away," sighed Cecily.

"Well, let's pretend to be, anyway," insisted the Story Girl. "Don't
let's think of parting. Let's think instead of how much we've laughed
this last year or so. I'm sure I shall never forget this dear old place.
We've had so many good times here."

"And some bad times, too," reminded Felix.

"Remember when Dan et the bad berries last summer?"

"And the time we were so scared over that bell ringing in the house,"
grinned Peter.

"And the Judgment Day," added Dan.

"And the time Paddy was bewitched," suggested Sara Ray.

"And when Peter was dying of the measles," said Felicity.

"And the time Jimmy Patterson was lost," said Dan. "Gee-whiz, but that
scared me out of a year's growth."

"Do you remember the time we took the magic seed," grinned Peter.

"Weren't we silly?" said Felicity. "I really can never look Billy
Robinson in the face when I meet him. I'm always sure he's laughing at
me in his sleeve."

"It's Billy Robinson who ought to be ashamed when he meets you or any of
us," commented Cecily severely. "I'd rather be cheated than cheat other
people."

"Do you mind the time we bought God's picture?" asked Peter.

"I wonder if it's where we buried it yet," speculated Felix.

"I put a stone over it, just as we did over Pat," said Cecily.

"I wish I could forget what God looks like," sighed Sara Ray. "I can't
forget it--and I can't forget what the bad place is like either, ever
since Peter preached that sermon on it."

"When you get to be a real minister you'll have to preach that sermon
over again, Peter," grinned Dan.

"My Aunt Jane used to say that people needed a sermon on that place once
in a while," retorted Peter seriously.

"Do you mind the night I et the cucumbers and milk to make me dream?"
said Cecily.

And therewith we hunted out our old dream books to read them again, and,
forgetful of coming partings, laughed over them till the old orchard
echoed to our mirth. When we had finished we stood in a circle around
the well and pledged "eternal friendship" in a cup of its unrivalled
water.

Then we joined hands and sang "Auld Lang Syne." Sara Ray cried bitterly
in lieu of singing.

"Look here," said the Story Girl, as we turned to leave the old orchard,
"I want to ask a favour of you all. Don't say good-bye to me tomorrow
morning."

"Why not?" demanded Felicity in astonishment.

"Because it's such a hopeless sort of word. Don't let's SAY it at all.
Just see me off with a wave of your hands. It won't seem half so bad
then. And don't any of you cry if you can help it. I want to remember
you all smiling."

We went out of the old orchard where the autumn night wind was beginning
to make its weird music in the russet boughs, and shut the little gate
behind us. Our revels there were ended.




CHAPTER XXXIII. THE STORY GIRL GOES


The morning dawned, rosy and clear and frosty. Everybody was up early,
for the travellers must leave in time to catch the nine o'clock train.
The horse was harnessed and Uncle Alec was waiting by the door. Aunt
Janet was crying, but everybody else was making a valiant effort not to.
The Awkward Man and Mrs. Dale came to see the last of their favourite.
Mrs. Dale had brought her a glorious sheaf of chrysanthemums, and the
Awkward Man gave her, quite gracefully, another little, old, limp book
from his library.

"Read it when you are sad or happy or lonely or discouraged or hopeful,"
he said gravely.

"He has really improved very much since he got married," whispered
Felicity to me.

Sara Stanley wore a smart new travelling suit and a blue felt hat with a
white feather. She looked so horribly grown up in it that we felt as if
she were lost to us already.

Sara Ray had vowed tearfully the night before that she would be up in
the morning to say farewell. But at this juncture Judy Pineau appeared
to say that Sara, with her usual luck, had a sore throat, and that her
mother consequently would not permit her to come. So Sara had written
her parting words in a three-cornered pink note.


  "My OWN DARLING FRIEND:--WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS my feelings over not
  being able to go up this morning to say good-bye to one I so
  FONDLY ADORE.  When I think that I cannot SEE YOU AGAIN my heart
  is almost TOO FULL FOR UTTERANCE.  But mother says I cannot and I
  MUST OBEY.  But I will be present IN SPIRIT.  It just BREAKS MY
  HEART that you are going SO FAR AWAY.  You have always been SO
  KIND to me and never hurt my feelings AS SOME DO and I shall miss
  you SO MUCH.  But I earnestly HOPE AND PRAY that you will be HAPPY
  AND PROSPEROUS wherever YOUR LOT IS CAST and not be seasick on THE
  GREAT OCEAN.  I hope you will find time AMONG YOUR MANY DUTIES to
  write me a letter ONCE IN A WHILE.  I shall ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU
  and please remember me.  I hope we WILL MEET AGAIN sometime, but
  if not may we meet in A FAR BETTER WORLD where there are no SAD
  PARTINGS.

  "Your true and loving friend,

                                           "SARA RAY"


"Poor little Sara," said the Story Girl, with a queer catch in her
voice, as she slipped the tear-blotted note into her pocket. "She isn't
a bad little soul, and I'm sorry I couldn't see her once more, though
maybe it's just as well for she'd have to cry and set us all off. I
WON'T cry. Felicity, don't you dare. Oh, you dear, darling people, I
love you all so much and I'll go on loving you always."

"Mind you write us every week at the very least," said Felicity, winking
furiously.

"Blair, Blair, watch over the child well," said Aunt Janet. "Remember,
she has no mother."

The Story Girl ran over to the buggy and climbed in. Uncle Blair
followed her. Her arms were full of Mrs. Dale's chrysanthemums, held
close up to her face, and her beautiful eyes shone softly at us over
them. No good-byes were said, as she wished. We all smiled bravely and
waved our hands as they drove out of the lane and down the moist red
road into the shadows of the fir wood in the valley. But we still stood
there, for we knew we should see the Story Girl once more. Beyond the
fir wood was an open curve in the road and she had promised to wave a
last farewell as they passed around it.

We watched the curve in silence, standing in a sorrowful little group
in the sunshine of the autumn morning. The delight of the world had been
ours on the golden road. It had enticed us with daisies and rewarded
us with roses. Blossom and lyric had waited on our wishes. Thoughts,
careless and sweet, had visited us. Laughter had been our comrade and
fearless Hope our guide. But now the shadow of change was over it.

"There she is," cried Felicity.

The Story Girl stood up and waved her chrysanthemums at us. We waved
wildly back until the buggy had driven around the curve. Then we went
slowly and silently back to the house. The Story Girl was gone.
