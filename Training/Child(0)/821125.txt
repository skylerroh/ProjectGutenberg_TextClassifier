
That was a moment of joy too deep for description. While the mother and
son were clasped in a long embrace, Hal could not help having his share
of the interview by crying out, "He's come home! Be n't it splendid?
He's come! Dear, dear, I shall burst."

"You dear good fellow," said Blair, throwing his arm over Hal's
shoulder, "you've been a comfort to my mother, I know."

"That he has," said Mrs. Robertson. "It was he who told me how your
noble courage saved your native town and the very home of your mother
from the flames. I thank God for such a son."

"Then I did what you would have wished, mother. Your praise is my
precious reward," said Blair with affectionate simplicity.

"God has sustained you in the path of duty, and brought you in safety to
your home and your mother. Let us thank him for all his mercies, my
son. Hal is no stranger to prayer now; he will gladly join us."

It was indeed the voice of true thanksgiving which rose from those
grateful hearts. He who has contrived joys for the meanest of his
creatures, doubtless takes a pure pleasure in the happiness which he
gives to his chosen ones even here; and rejoices to know that it is but
the foreshadowing of that eternal delight in store for them where
parting shall be no more.




CHAPTER XX.

SACRED JOY.


Sweetly the Sabbath bells sounded in the ear of Blair Robertson. What a
joy it was to be once more at home, once more in his native land. How
delightful the thought that prayer had already gone up from many family
altars, and already Christ's little ones were gathering to be taught of
him and sing his praise. To dwell among the ungodly is indeed a bitter
trial. The society of the unprincipled had been to Blair like a dark
cloud overshadowing his pathway; and it was a new delight to him to be
once more among the people of God. What a blessing it seemed to him to
be a dweller in the land of light and liberty, where the free
worshippers might pray and praise without let or hinderance from
ungodly men.

Full of such glad thoughts, he walked towards the church so endeared to
him by many hallowed associations. His mother was at his side, and his
kind townsmen on every hand were giving him their cordial greeting,
while the little children looked at him with curious wonder, as the
brave boy whom even their fathers "delighted to honor."

Once in the house of God, all other thoughts were hushed in the mind of
Blair, by the remembrance of the presence into which he was now ushered.
It was a joy to him to join in heartfelt prayer, and praise with so many
true children of God, and to stand among his brethren who like him could
say from the heart, "I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ."

A deep, strong voice near him made the young worshipper aware of the
presence of Derry Duck in the solemn assembly, joining with his whole
heart in the hymn of praise. Ah, men might heap honor upon the young
patriot, and applaud his courage in the hour of danger, and welcome was
their cordial tribute; but their loudest acclamations had not power to
wake in the soul of Blair Robertson such deep, grateful joy as the sight
of that ransomed sailor, brought home to the Father's house.

Every word of the service had its meaning to Derry Duck. He confessed
anew the sins of his burdened heart, and accepted once more the free
forgiveness found in Christ Jesus. He called on God as his Father, and
seemed to be professing before men and angels the faith for which he was
willing to die.

The clergyman gave forth the simple notice, "A person desires to return
thanks for a safe return from sea." All eyes were suddenly bent upon
Blair with loving pride. Very deep and true was the thanksgiving of the
Fairport congregation for the return of their brave deliverer; but who
shall tell what passed in the mother's heart, or in that of her
rejoicing son?




CHAPTER XXI.

CONCLUSION.


It was in vain that Blair tried to persuade Derry Duck to see his
mother, and accept her thanks for his kindness to her wounded boy. Derry
declared that he would hear no thanks, the odds were all on the other
side. And as for sitting down in a Christian woman's parlor, and making
himself easy there, he wasn't fit for that. A forgiven sinner he
believed he was, and could bow in the house of God with his fellow-men;
but he was a beginner in the ways of godliness, too much tainted with
his miserable past to be right company for those who had never gone so
far astray. Besides, he pleaded, he had his little flower to see, in her
own little nook. It would be a shame to him to set his foot on any
other threshold before he had spoken to her. To her his first spare
hours belonged.

Derry returned from his visit to his child with his heart more than ever
full of love to his darling. She had received his letter, and rejoiced
over it with great joy, declaring that not a treasure she possessed was
so precious. Derry had allowed himself but the usual short interview,
ever trembling lest he should mar her delight in her father by some
knowledge of the wild life he had led. Yet, when he laid his hand on her
head at parting, he could not resist speaking the fervent "God bless
you, darling," which stirred at his heart.

She had clasped and kissed his hand with a sudden gladness, as if such
words from him were both a joy and a surprise. He waited for no
questions, but hurried away.

"When the war is over, you will come home and settle down with your
little housekeeper, and let her take care of you. How glad that will
make her," said Blair persuasively.

"I shall never be fit company for her," said Derry firmly; "I know it,
my boy. True, I'm a changed man. I trust I'm forgiven for the sake of
the Crucified. But I've a pit within that needs purging thrice over. A
man like me is not made into a saint in a minute, though he may read his
pardon clear. 'Following hard after,' shall be my motto; 'following on
to know the Lord.' I'm not the one to sit down at the chimney-side with
a creature like her. No, Blair, I tell you no. Look here, my boy. Here's
my path of duty. I've a God to glorify, I've a country to serve. Rough
sailors wont think of my ways as she would. If I'm like a rock in what I
know is right, and God will help me, I can do 'em good. I can set up
the right banner among 'em. I can make the forecastle praise the great
and holy name. It is for this I mean to work. It is for this I mean to
be a sailor now. There's not a port I've ever set foot in, but I've
shamed a Christian land there. I mean to put in to every port where I've
showed my face, and let them see I've changed my colors. Where I've done
evil, there I mean to try to do good. I can't wipe out bygones. They are
written in the book _up there_. But there's One in white robes will
stand for me before his Father's throne. I'll work for Him while there's
life in me; and when I die, I hope it will be giving praise and glory to
his name. I want to do my country credit too. It's no shining thing, to
get in the papers, that I expect to do; but just a patient serving God,
that brings honor to the land where a man was born. You will pray for
me, I know, when I'm off on the water; and if I die--your mother knows
the name--she'll go to my little darling, and tell her how her father
loved her, and hopes to live with her in the kingdom of heaven. I shall
be fit to sit down with her at that marriage-feast. I shall have on the
'white robes,' and poor Derry Duck will have a 'new name,' by which the
angels will call him, and his little darling will not blush to hear it.
I shall live with her there." Derry dashed the tears from his eyes as he
spoke, but he firmly repeated, "Here, I must labor alone, and struggle
to grow like the Master. _There_, none shall lay any thing to the charge
of God's elect; and I and my pretty one will join with her mother in
singing round the throne. Good-by, my boy. God bless you. You have sent
out a Christian sailor to work for him on the seas. You have sent out a
lover of his country to strive to do her honor in his closet on his
knees, at his duty in the fight, and in his hammock when they drop him
into the deep sea."

Derry wrung the hand of the young patriot, and then moved away with
quick uncertain steps. A lonely man, yet not alone, there was a comfort
and joy in the rough sailor's heart. His life of labor was to be a glad
voyage to a better country, whose harbor lights would be ever leading
him onward, and whose shining shore would ever glisten for him in the
certain future beyond the grave.

The young patriot had indeed been blessed in winning such a devoted
servant to the Master's cause, and such a Christian sailor to maintain
the honor of his native land.

There was more such work for Blair Robertson, and for it he steadily
labored.

Peace came with its illuminations and festivities. The sword was laid
aside on sea and land, yet Blair might still be serving the country he
so dearly loved. His example, his fireside talk, and his glowing words
in the assemblies of his people, might ever cast their weight in the
right balance. The outcasts and the immigrant were still to be so
trained and ennobled as to make them fit citizens of our free and happy
land. Above all, by his prayers and his holy living, he might call down
on his home and country such a blessing as ever encompasses the dwelling
of him who feareth the Lord.

To be such a patriot was the aim of Blair Robertson. Would that there
were many so to live and labor. Then might we be sure of victory over
all our enemies, and of the abounding blessings of lasting peace.
