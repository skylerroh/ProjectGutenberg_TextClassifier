cotton we grow here. The Western and Eastern Highlands pass through our
country.

[Illustration: North America]

We have a great quantity of lumber, stone, coal and iron for making our
comfortable homes. In what part of the country is each of these
products obtained? Why? Right in our own United States is found nearly
everything that is necessary to make us comfortable and happy.

[Illustration: COTTON FIELD.]

We have hundreds of towns with homes, factories, schools, hospitals and
churches. Over every public building floats our beautiful flag, the
Stars and Stripes.

Our laws are made in the capital, which is named Washington, after
George Washington, our first president. Find Washington on the map. How
long would it take to go to Washington from our home? It is a beautiful
city. The Capitol building is one of the finest in the world. The
President of the United States lives in the White House.

Alaska, in the north-west, and the island of Porto Rico, in the
south-east, belong to the United States. We own other islands in other
parts of the world.

_British America_ is our next neighbor on the north. It includes all of
the Dominion of Canada and the Island of Newfoundland. It belongs to
England or Great Britain in Europe.

[Illustration: MOUNTAIN GOAT.]

The Great Central Plain and the Western Highlands pass through it, and
yet it is not a rich country with many people like the United States.
Can you tell why?

There are large crops of fruit and grain in the southern part only of
British America. In this part only are there any large cities. The few
people in the northern part go there to hunt the animals for furs and to
find gold. Many whales live in the cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean and
Hudson Bay. Are they of use to man?


4

_Danish America_ is the name given to the two islands Greenland and
Iceland, because they belong to Denmark, a country of Europe.

Greenland lies in which zones? What kind of climate has it? A few white
people and some Eskimos live in the southern part. The northern part has
no life at all.

What do you know of the people, the plants and the animals of this
region?

In what zone is Iceland? Why is the climate very cold? Many fish are
caught in the ocean around Iceland. The people on the island are able to
raise little but grass to feed their sheep and cattle.

There are many mountains in Iceland. Some of them send out steam and
melted rock and are called _volcanoes_.


5

_Mexico_ is our southern neighbor. This country has a president and a
government somewhat like ours.

Both Indians and white people live in Mexico. The climate is so warm in
the valleys that the people living there cannot work so hard as they do
in the United States. So they do not have large factories and many fine
schools, hospitals and libraries as we have. Why do they not build these
on the mountains where the climate is pleasant?

They have large plantations where they raise rubber, sugar, cotton,
coffee, tobacco and fruit and many cattle.

The great Western Highlands extend down through Mexico, and silver,
copper and coal are mined in them. Some of these mountains are
volcanoes. What does this mean?


6

Central America is still warmer than Mexico. It is entirely in what
zone? The plants and animals are much like those of Mexico.


7

The West Indies consist of many islands. The largest are Cuba, Haiti,
Jamaica and Porto Rico. Which belongs to the United States? These
islands have a warm climate. What do you think is raised on the
plantations by the white people and negroes?

The West Indies separate a part of the ocean from the main Atlantic
Ocean. This smaller part is called the _Caribbean Sea_. Notice what
countries it touches.
