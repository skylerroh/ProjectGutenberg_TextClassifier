PREFACE


In this small volume the boys of many lands and races whose stories
are told, have been selected not because they later became famous men,
although some of them did, but because each one achieved something
noteworthy as a boy. And in each boy's character, whether historic or
legendary, courage was the marked trait. For this reason it is hoped
that their stories will prove stimulating to some who read them.

TEN BOYS FROM HISTORY




STEPHEN AND NICHOLAS:

Boy Crusaders

    "To the sea of fools
    Led the path of the children."

                    _Old Epigram._


Just a word about the Crusades, or Holy Wars, before we begin our
story.

A war is generally a conflict between nations, countries, or individuals,
for possession of land or a throne, but the Holy Wars were not such.
They were expeditions made by those Christians who were determined to
rescue the Sepulchre, or tomb, of Christ and the City of Jerusalem,
from the rule of unbelievers.

For eighty-eight years Christian kings ruled in Palestine, then all the
land was conquered by the Mohammedans, except a few cities, and the
Christians sent out another, and still another, and another expedition
to subdue the enemy, but all were useless. The Holy City and the Holy
Sepulchre were still in the hands of infidels, who persecuted the
pilgrims who visited the Holy Tomb; and the Christians sent a
heart-rending cry to all Europe for help, but Europe was slow to answer
the appeal, and it was several years after Pope Innocent ordered a new
Crusade, before an army departed for the scene of conflict.

It was during this interval that the Children's Crusade or Holy War,
took place--of which we are about to read.

But first let us go back to the city of Chartres, on the 25th day of
April, 1212, when a surging crowd of men and women is filling every
street and by-way of the quaint city.

What are the crowds watching so eagerly? A procession of priests and
laymen, carrying banners and black-draped crosses, and chanting in
solemn unison as they march.

It is the day of the celebration in Chartres of the "Black Crosses," an
old church ceremony instituted centuries before, by Gregory the Great,
during the ravages of the Plague, but now celebrated as an appeal to
the people to free Jerusalem and the Holy Tomb from the hands of the
infidels.

The solemn ranks of the procession move slowly through the streets of
Chartres, carrying black-draped symbols of a Saviour's death, chanting
deep-toned litanies, and that the old ceremony has lost none of its
emotional power is shown by the tears and silence of the watching
throngs, while among all the crowd none is more profoundly stirred than
a slender shepherd lad from the neighbouring town of Cloyes, who is
seeing the ceremony for the first time.

Agile as such a lad should be, and sturdy in consequence of his
out-of-door life, Stephen, for that was his name, found it an easy
matter to breast the surging tide of spectators following the
procession, to slip in where he could to best advantage watch the
solemn ceremonies, to stand without fatigue while he drank in all the
emotional thrill of the day.

The shrouded crosses, the appeals for rescue of an entombed Christ in
the hands of an infidel enemy, the tears and cries of the crowds,
worked on the impressionable shepherd lad, unaccustomed to aught but
life with his flocks, worked on him so powerfully that he was hot with
a desire to rush to Jerusalem and expel the hated Mohammedans from that
land and city, once blessed by the living presence of Jesus, and
hallowed by the possession of his tomb.

So filled with enthusiasm was Stephen that his burning cheeks and
glowing eyes told the tale to an observant priest, who to accomplish
his own end, kept close watch of the boy, spoke to him, making
inquiries as to his name and occupation, and then decided to make him a
tool of destiny.

But of this Stephen knew nothing. Filled with thoughts of what he had
seen and heard, at evening he walked slowly towards his home in the
little village of Cloyes, walking less on solid earth than on a cloud
of dreams and desires, and from that moment he was never again the
contented shepherd lad, son of the peasant of Cloyes. He was alive with
new emotions now, and as he wandered on the hillside with his flock he
was in imagination the hero of daring deeds, taking part in such
pictured scenes as his excited fancy could conjure up, until at last,
he was in a state of mind suited to any enterprise, prepared to believe
any story, however improbable, to accept any life except that of his
own monotonous peasant existence.

While in this mood there came to him on his hillside, several days
later, a stranger in the dress of a pilgrim, returned, as he at first
said, from Palestine. He was on his way to a distant home and in need
of food.

Only too eagerly did Stephen share with him such food as he had, asking
in return to be told of the wonders of the Holy Land and of the daring
deeds of the heroes who had fallen there in battle. The stranger
readily complied with this request and poured into the boy's credulous
ears tales well calculated to thrill and excite his already inflamed
fancy. Then, watching Stephen closely as he spoke, the stranger said
with solemn earnestness:

"But this is not all I have to tell, my lad. There is work for you to
do,--for you, the Lord's anointed, his chosen apostle, and in the name
of Christ and his Holy Cross, I bid you arise and do his will."

"Work?--for me? From whom comes this message?"

Stephen's eyes were lit with the fire of excited desire and his voice
trembled with emotion.

Very slowly the answering words fell from his companion's lips:

"The message is brought by him who sends it. Behold, lad, the Christ of
history and of truth! _I_ bid you arise--rouse up the youth of our
land! Lead them to that Holy Sepulchre! As prophet and as leader, go
thou where they shall follow, and bring to pass that which nobles and
soldiers have failed to accomplish. Go lad--go!"

Stephen's breath came in quick gasps--his eyes were like coals of fire
as he sank on his knees, crying:

"Oh bless me--bless me--I will go--Lord, I will go!"

A hand was laid gently on his head as the deep voice said, "In the name
of Jesus, lad--in the name of the Crucified, lead thou thy troops to
victory. Across the land, across the sea, lead them to victory!" Then
in a less impassioned tone, the stranger added, "I leave with you a
letter to the king of France. Haste thou to him with this proof of thy
divine mission and he will aid thee in thy enterprise. In the name of
Jesus, lad, arise and go!"

A letter was pressed into Stephen's hand. He heard retreating
footsteps, and before he had gained his composure and risen to his
feet, his divine guest was gone. He was alone with his straying flock,
not sure except for the letter, whether he had had a vision or a
visitor.

And how was he to know, innocent peasant lad, of an ignorant and
superstitious ancestry, brought up on miraculous tales of saints and
seers, that the Christ of his visit was no other than that priest whose
attention Stephen had attracted by his emotion at Chartres, who with
crafty keenness had chosen the peasant boy to carry out his purpose of
arousing the youth of the land to undertake a new Crusade? How was
Stephen, all aflame as he was, to be supposed to penetrate the priest's
