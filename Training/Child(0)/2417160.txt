affairs. I understand those women who say they don't want the ballot.
They purpose to hold the real power while we go through the mockery of
making laws. They want the power without the responsibility. (Suppose my
squash had not come up, or my beans--as they threatened at one time--had
gone the wrong way: where would I have been?) We are to be held to all
the responsibilities. Woman takes the lead in all the departments,
leaving us politics only. And what is politics? Let me raise the
vegetables of a nation, says Polly, and I care not who makes its
politics. Here I sat at the table, armed with the ballot, but really
powerless among my own vegetables. While we are being amused by the
ballot, woman is quietly taking things into her own hands.

QUESTIONS FOR STUDY

The author is writing of the ninth and tenth weeks of his work; he now
has time to stop and moralize about his garden. Do not take what he says
too seriously; look for the fun in it. Is he in earnest about the moral
qualities of vegetables? Why cannot the bean figure in poetry and
romance? Can you name any prose or verse in which corn does? Explain
what is said about the resemblance of some people to cucumbers. Why is
celery more aristocratic than potato? Is "them" the right word in the
sentence: "I do not pull them up"? Explain what is meant by the
paragraph on salads. Why is the tomato a "_parvenu_"? Does the author
wish to cast a slur on the Darwinian theory? Is it true that moral
character is influenced by what one eats? What is the catechism? What do
you think of the author's theories about scarecrows? About "saving men
from any particular vice"? Why does raising one's own vegetables make
one feel generous? How does the author pass from vegetables to woman
suffrage? Is he in earnest in what he says? What does one get out of a
selection like this?

SUGGESTIONS FOR WRITING

=My First Attempt at Gardening=:--Tell how you came to make the garden.
Was there any talk about it before it was begun? What were your plans
concerning it? Did you spend any time in consulting seed catalogues?
Tell about buying (or otherwise securing) the seeds. If you got them
from some more experienced gardener than yourself, report the talk about
them. Tell how you made the ground ready; how you planted the seeds.
Take the reader into your confidence as to your hopes and uncertainties
when the sprouts began to appear. Did the garden suffer any misfortunes
from the frost, or the drought, or the depredations of the hens? Can you
remember any conversation about it? Tell about the weeding, and what was
said when it became necessary. Trace the progress of the garden; tell of
its success or failure as time went on. What did you do with the
products? Did any one praise or make fun of you? How did you feel? Did
you want to have another garden?

=The Scarecrow=:--You might speak first about the garden--its prosperity
and beauty, and the fruit or vegetables that it was producing. Then
speak about the birds, and tell how they acted and what they did. Did
you try driving them away? What was said about them? Now tell about the
plans for the scarecrow. Give an account of how it was set up, and what
clothes were put on it. How did it look? What was said about it? Give
one or two incidents (real or imaginary) in which it was concerned. Was
it of any use? How long did it remain in its place?

=Votes for Women=:--There are several ways in which you could deal with
this subject:--

(_a_) If you have seen a suffrage parade, you might describe it and tell
how it impressed you. (_b_) Perhaps you could write of some particular
person who was interested in votes for women: How did she [or he] look,
and what did she say? (_c_) Report a lecture on suffrage. (_d_) Give two
or three arguments for or against woman's suffrage; do not try to take
up too many, but deal with each rather completely. (_e_) Imagine two
people talking together about suffrage--for instance, two old men; a man
and a woman; a young woman and an old one; a child and a grown person;
two children. (_f_) Imagine the author of the selection and his wife
Polly talking about suffrage at the dinner table.

THE SINGING MAN

JOSEPHINE PRESTON PEABODY


I

    He sang above the vineyards of the world.
      And after him the vines with woven hands
    Clambered and clung, and everywhere unfurled
      Triumphing green above the barren lands;
    Till high as gardens grow, he climbed, he stood,
      Sun-crowned with life and strength, and singing toil,
    And looked upon his work; and it was good:
            The corn, the wine, the oil.

    He sang above the noon. The topmost cleft
      That grudged him footing on the mountain scars
    He planted and despaired not; till he left
      His vines soft breathing to the host of stars.
    He wrought, he tilled; and even as he sang,
      The creatures of his planting laughed to scorn
    The ancient threat of deserts where there sprang
            The wine, the oil, the corn!

    He sang not for abundance.--Over-lords
      Took of his tilth. Yet was there still to reap,
    The portion of his labor; dear rewards
      Of sunlit day, and bread, and human sleep.
    He sang for strength; for glory of the light.
      He dreamed above the furrows, 'They are mine!'
    When all he wrought stood fair before his sight
            With corn, and oil, and wine.

    _Truly, the light is sweet_
          _Yea, and a pleasant thing_
            _It is to see the Sun._
        _And that a man should eat_
            _His bread that he hath won_;--
        (_So is it sung and said_),
          _That he should take and keep_,
            _After his laboring_,
        _The portion of his labor in his bread_,
          _His bread that he hath won_;
          _Yea, and in quiet sleep_,
            _When all is done._

    He sang; above the burden and the heat,
      Above all seasons with their fitful grace;
    Above the chance and change that led his feet
      To this last ambush of the Market-place.
    'Enough for him,' they said--and still they say--
      'A crust, with air to breathe, and sun to shine;
    He asks no more!'--Before they took away
            The corn, the oil, the wine.

    He sang. No more he sings now, anywhere.
      Light was enough, before he was undone.
    They knew it well, who took away the air,
      --Who took away the sun;
    Who took, to serve their soul-devouring greed,
      Himself, his breath, his bread--the goad of toil;--
    Who have and hold, before the eyes of Need,
            The corn, the wine,--the oil!


        _Truly, one thing is sweet_
        _Of things beneath the Sun_;
    _This, that a man should earn his bread and eat_,
        _Rejoicing in his work which he hath done._
            _What shall be sung or said_
              _Of desolate deceit_,
            _When others take his bread_;
            _His and his children's bread?_--
            _And the laborer hath none._
    _This, for his portion now, of all that he hath done._
              _He earns; and others eat._
            _He starves;--they sit at meat_
              _Who have taken away the Sun._


II

    Seek him now, that singing Man.
    Look for him,
    Look for him
    In the mills,
    In the mines;
    Where the very daylight pines,--
    He, who once did walk the hills!
    You shall find him, if you scan
    Shapes all unbefitting Man,
    Bodies warped, and faces dim.
    In the mines; in the mills
    Where the ceaseless thunder fills
    Spaces of the human brain
    Till all thought is turned to pain.
    Where the skirl of wheel on wheel,
    Grinding him who is their tool,
    Makes the shattered senses reel
    To the numbness of the fool.
    Perisht thought, and halting tongue--
    (Once it spoke;--once it sung!)
    Live to hunger, dead to song.
    Only heart-beats loud with wrong
    Hammer on,--_How long?_
    ... _How long?_--_How long?_

    Search for him;
    Search for him;
    Where the crazy atoms swim
    Up the fiery furnace-blast.
    You shall find him, at the last,--
    He whose forehead braved the sun,--
    Wreckt and tortured and undone.
    Where no breath across the heat
    Whispers him that life was sweet;
    But the sparkles mock and flare,
    Scattering up the crooked air.
    (Blackened with that bitter mirk,--
    Would God know His handiwork?)

    Thought is not for such as he;
    Naught but strength, and misery;
    Since, for just the bite and sup,
    Life must needs be swallowed up.
    Only, reeling up the sky,
    Hurtling flames that hurry by,
    Gasp and flare, with _Why_--_Why_,
    ... _Why?_...

    Why the human mind of him
    Shrinks, and falters and is dim
    When he tries to make it out:
    What the torture is about.--
    Why he breathes, a fugitive
    Whom the World forbids to live.
    Why he earned for his abode,
    Habitation of the toad!
    Why his fevered day by day
    Will not serve to drive away
    Horror that must always haunt:--
    ... _Want_ ... _Want!_
    Nightmare shot with waking pangs;--
    Tightening coil, and certain fangs,
    Close and closer, always nigh ...
    ... _Why?_... _Why?_

    Why he labors under ban
    That denies him for a man.
    Why his utmost drop of blood
    Buys for him no human good;
    Why his utmost urge of strength
    Only lets Them starve at length;--
    Will not let him starve alone;
    He must watch, and see his own
    Fade and fail, and starve, and die.
    .     .     .     .    .    .    .
    ... _Why?_... _Why?_
    .     .     .     .    .    .    .
    Heart-beats, in a hammering song,
    Heavy as an ox may plod,
    Goaded--goaded--faint with wrong,
    Cry unto some ghost of God
    ... _How long_?... _How long?_
                       ... _How long?_


III

    Seek him yet. Search for him!
    You shall find him, spent and grim;
    In the prisons, where we pen
    These unsightly shards of men.
    Sheltered fast;
    Housed at length;
    Clothed and fed, no matter how!--
    Where the householders, aghast,
    Measure in his broken strength
    Nought but power for evil, now.
    Beast-of-burden drudgeries
    Could not earn him what was his:
    He who heard the world applaud
    Glories seized by force and fraud,
    He must break,--he must take!--
    Both for hate and hunger's sake.
    He must seize by fraud and force;
    He must strike, without remorse!
    Seize he might; but never keep.
    Strike, his once!--Behold him here.
    (Human life we buy so cheap,
    Who should know we held it dear?)

    No denial,--no defence
    From a brain bereft of sense,
    Any more than penitence.
    But the heart-beats now, that plod
    Goaded--goaded--dumb with wrong,
    Ask not even a ghost of God
              ... _How long_?

      _When the Sea gives up its dead,_
      _Prison caverns, yield instead_
      _This, rejected and despised;_
