PART III.

HARRY'S NURSERY SONGS.




NURSERY SONGS.


[Illustration]

  Rock-a-bye, baby, thy cradle is green;
    Father's a nobleman, mother's a queen;
  And Betty's a lady, and wears a gold ring;
  And Harry's a drummer, and drums for the king.




  Hush-a-bye, baby, on the tree-top!
  When the wind blows, the cradle will rock;
  When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall,
  Down will come baby, cradle, and all.

[Illustration]




  Bye, oh, my baby!
  When I was a lady,
  Oh then my poor babe didn't cry!
  But my baby is weeping
  For want of good keeping.
  Oh, I fear my poor baby will die.




  Hush-a-bye, babby, lie still with thy daddy;
    Thy mammy is gone to the mill
  To get some wheat, to make some meat,
    So pray, my dear babby, lie still.




  How many days has my baby to play?
    Saturday, Sunday, Monday,
  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
    Saturday, Sunday, Monday.




  Hush-a-bye, baby,
    Daddy is near,
  Mammy's a lady,
    And that's very clear.




[Illustration]

  Dance to your daddy
    My bonny laddy,
  Dance to your ninny,
    My sweet lamb;
  You shall have a fishy
  In a little dishy,
  And a whirligiggy,
    And some nice jam.




  Dance, little baby, dance up high,
  Never mind, baby, mother is nigh;
  Crow and caper, caper and crow;
  There, little baby, there you go,
  Up to the ceiling, down to the ground,
  Backwards and forwards, round and round;
  Dance, little baby, and mother will sing,
  With the merry coral, ding, ding, ding!




  Here we go up, up, up,
    And here we go down, down, downy,
  And here we go backwards and forwards,
    And here we go round, round, roundy.




  Danty baby diddy,
  What can mammy do wid'e?
  Sit in her lap,
  And she'll give you some pap,
    Danty baby diddy!




[Illustration]

  Bye, baby bunting,
  Father's gone a-hunting,
  To get a little rabbit-skin
  To wrap the baby bunting in.




  Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall,
  Not all the king's horses, nor all the king's men,
  Could set Humpty Dumpty up again.




  A Long-tail'd pig,
    Or a short-tail'd pig,
    Or a pig without a tail?
  A sow-pig, or a boar-pig,
    Or a pig with a curly tail?




[Illustration]


  Little Tom Tucker
  Sings for his supper:
  What shall he eat?
  White bread and butter.
  How shall he cut it
  Without e'er a knife?
  How will he be married
  Without e'er a wife?




  Pat a cake, pat a cake, baker's man;
  So I will, master, as fast as I can;
  Pat it, and prick it, and mark it with B,
  And toss it in the oven for baby and me.




  See-saw, Margery-daw,
    Harry shall have a new master;
  He shall not have but a penny a-day,
    Because he won't work any faster.
