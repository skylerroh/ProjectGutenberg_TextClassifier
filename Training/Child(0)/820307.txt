what to do.

Kate was soon seriously ill, for the shock had brought on an attack of
brain fever, and during her wild ramblings and half incoherent talk her
nurses heard a good deal of how Mrs. Maple had been deceived and robbed
by her trusted shop-woman, but no word about the watches found in her
possession did Kate ever utter.

By the time Mrs. Haydon reached London the first examination of the
prisoners was over, and Kate was so far exculpated from the charge
brought against her, for one of the principal thieves voluntarily
stated that the girls had nothing to do with the robbery--the watches
had been dropped into the open bag without Kate's knowledge, when the
alarm was first raised, and this fact was so far borne out by the
policeman, who stated how readily Kate had handed him the bag, saying
she had it with her at the theatre.  Mrs. Maple was also present to
give the girls a good character, but this was somewhat modified by the
confession of William Minn, who, being pressed by the magistrate, gave
a full account of his acquaintance with the girls, and how he and his
friends had been supplied with pastry at Mrs. Maple's expense, by the
two foolish girls.  Marion denied nothing now.  Her only anxiety seemed
to be to screen Kate as much as she could, and she declared that Kate
had been led into doing what she did by her direction.

But it was small comfort to Mrs. Haydon to hear that her daughter had
been led to do wrong through the influence of her cousin.  The shame
and disgrace of her darling daughter having been in prison so bowed her
with woe that, added to the bitter pain of not being able to nurse her
in her illness, almost laid her on a bed of sickness.  Marion was
released, and returned home some days before Kate could be removed from
the infirmary, and a more unhappy household than that can scarcely be
imagined.  Marion had, of course, lost her situation and her character
too, and was so crushed in spirit that she did not need the reproaches
of her brothers and sisters to make her feel the shame of her position
more keenly.

Bitter as her aunt had felt against her for leading Kate astray as she
had done, she could not but pity the poor girl, and reflect, too, that
Kate was, after all, more to blame than Marion, for she had been more
carefully taught than her cousin.

At last Kate was able to be removed from the infirmary to her uncle's
house, but she felt little joy or hope at the thought of getting better.

"I don't deserve to get better, mother," she whispered, when her mother
was trying to coax her to take a little beef-tea.  "I know where I have
been all this time, and why you could not come to be with me always.
Oh, mother, mother!" and Kate covered her face with her hands and
sobbed so violently that her mother grew quite alarmed.

"Hush, hush, Kate, you must be quiet, or you will make yourself worse,
and if you are not fit to live how can you be fit to die?" said her
mother, firmly.

Kate shuddered, but checked her sobs.  "Oh, mother, I was so afraid I
should, and I'm not--I'm not fit to die.  I have been such a wicked
girl, mother.  I did not steal the watches, but I have done things
quite as bad--I've deceived everybody, mother."

"And yourself too," said Mrs. Haydon.

"How could I do that, mother?  I knew all the time that I was doing
wrong."

"Of course you did, my dear, but you had begun to deceive yourself long
before you came to London, and that was when the mischief began.  I
think I have been to blame, too, perhaps, for I was proud of my
truthful, upright girl, and may have let you hear me say more than was
good for you to hear and you grew proud and self-righteous as a
Pharisee."

"And now, now I am the worst girl living," sobbed Kate.  "Oh, mother,
I've thought of it all the while I was in prison.  I, a Sunday scholar,
in prison," she repeated with a shudder.  "I have been a shame and
disgrace to my class and teacher as well as you, mother, but I've
sinned against God worst of all.  Oh, mother, will He ever forgive me
do you think?"

"Yes, Kate; He will forgive anything you have done or can do, for the
sake of His dear Son, and if you are spared--as I hope and trust you
may be--you must live a very different life in future.  You thought you
were strong enough and good enough before and did not need His grace.
You never felt that you were a sinner needing the blood of Christ to
cleanse and pardon you, but now----"

"Oh, mother, mother, my sins are too great," broke in Kate.  "How could
the Lord Jesus forgive such a wicked girl as I am?"

"Because He loved you--loved you so much as to die for you, Kate.  My
dear, you have thought so much of your own goodness that it is hard for
you to believe now that God can forgive you without your deserving it;
but was it as hard for you to believe that I would forgive you?"

Kate shook her head.  "I knew you would forgive though I never could
deserve it, because you always loved me so much," she said slowly.

"My dear, God loves you more than I do, with a wiser, purer, better
love than even mine, and He wants you to believe it now, Kate, and hope
in Him.  I know you have been so weak and foolish that you cannot have
any hope of yourself; but hope in God, my darling, confess all your
sins to Him, tell Him the weakness and folly you have been guilty of,
and ask His pardon for the past and strength and grace to live a new
life in Christ for the future."

"I have prayed that He would pardon me, but oh, mother, how can I hope,
how can I believe?  He is so great, so holy."

"By taking Him at His word.  If I told you anything, Kate, do you think
it would be honouring me to say, 'You are so good, mother, I can't
believe half you say?'  Yet this is the way you are speaking of God; He
says, 'Him that cometh unto Me I will in no wise cast out,' and 'Jesus
Christ came into the world to save sinners.'  Mind, Kate, it was Jesus
Christ, not the sinner's repentance, the tears he shed, the grief he
felt, but Jesus Christ, who died 'the Just for the unjust.'"

After this talk with her mother Kate grew more calm and less unhappy.
The prospect of going home, however, so different from what Kate had
anticipated that return would be, was anything but pleasant now.

"Oh, mother, how can I meet Miss Eldon again?' she whispered one day.

"It will be hard for you, I know, but you must bear it, Kate, as part,
at least, of the punishment of your sins.  Sorrow and shame must follow
sin, and though God forgives us He does not--cannot take away the
consequences of them.  They are bitter enough to you and poor Marion,
too, for situations and character are both lost, and it is not easy
work to regain a good character when once it has been lost."

Kate's future was, of course, a great anxiety to her mother, especially
after they got home and Kate grew stronger.  News of her disgrace had
somehow got wind in the village and many of her former schoolfellows
shunned her, especially Esther, who said she had her own character to
take care of.

Gentle, brave, Mary Green, now the trusted servant of Lady Hazeldean,
however, contrived to see her old schoolfellow as often as she could;
and Miss Eldon, convinced of her repentance, offered at last to receive
her as kitchenmaid in her own house--a situation Kate would have
despised before, but which she was very grateful to get now.  She also
asked the lady to help her cousin if she could, and at her request a
friend took Marion into her service, where for the first time she had
the opportunity of learning those truths Kate had been taught before
she went to London.  Marion profited by what she was taught, and she
and Kate both became useful and honoured women, loved and respected by
all who knew them, and few remembered now that they had once been in
prison or passed through such a shameful and bitter experience as
"KATE'S ORDEAL."
