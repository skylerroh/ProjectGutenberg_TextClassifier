very small, and it has been less than an hour since he passed here. They
are ahead of us, directly in our path."

"What do you think we ought to do, Dave?" asked Robert, anxiously. "You
know we want to go south as fast as we can."

"We must try to go around Langlade," replied Willet. "It's true, we'll lose
time, but it's better to lose time and be late a little than to lose our
lives and never get there at all."

"The Great Bear is a very wise man," said Tayoga.

They made at once a sharp curve toward the east, but just when they thought
they were passing parallel with Langlade's band, they were fired upon from
a thicket, the bullet singing by Robert's ear. The three took cover in the
bushes, and a long and trying combat of sharpshooters took place. Two
warriors were slain and both Willet and Tayoga were grazed by the Indian
fire, but they were not hurt. Robert once caught sight of Langlade, and he
might have dropped the partisan with his bullet, but his heart held his
hand. Langlade had shown him many a kindness, during his long captivity
and, although he was a fierce enemy now, the lad was not one to forget. As
he had spared De Galissonniere, so would he spare Langlade, and, in a
moment or two, the Frenchman was gone from his sight.

Another dark and rainy night came, and, protected by it, they crept in
silence past the partisan's band soon leaving this new danger far behind
them. Tayoga was very grateful, and accepted their escape as a sign.

"While Manitou, who rules all things, has decreed that we must suffer much
before victory," he said, "yet, as I see it, he has decreed also that we
three shall not fall, else why does he spread so many dangers before us,
and then take us safely through them?"

"It looks the same way to me," said Willet. "The dark and rainy night that
he sent enabled us to pass by Langlade and his band."

"A second black night following a first," said Tayoga, devoutly. "I do not
doubt that it was sent for our benefit by Manitou, who is lord even over
Tododaho and Areskoui."

They made good speed near the shores of Andiatarocte and now and then they
caught glimpses once more through the heavy green foliage of the lake's
glittering waters. But they saw anew the canoes of the French and Indians
upon its surface, and they realized with increasing force that
Andiatarocte, so vital in the great struggle, belonged, for the time at
least, to their enemies. Yet the three themselves were favored. The rain
ceased, a warm wind out of the south dried the forest, and their flight
became easy. A fat deer stood in their path and fairly asked to be shot,
furnishing them all the food they might need for days to come, and they
were able to dress and prepare it at their leisure.

"It is clear, as I have already surmised and stated," said Tayoga in his
precise language, "that the frown of Manitou is not for us three. The way
opens before us, and we shall rejoin our friends."

"If we have any friends left," said the hunter. "I fear greatly, Tayoga,
that Montcalm will have struck before we arrive. He has a powerful force
with plenty of cannon, and we know he acts with decision and speed."

"He has struck already and he has struck terribly," said Tayoga with great
gravity.

"How do you know that?" asked Robert, startled.

"I do not know it because of anything that has been told to me in words,"
replied the Onondaga, "but O, Dagaeoga, the mind, which is often more
potent than eye or ear, as I have told you so many times, is now warning
me. We know that our people farther south have been in disagreement. The
governors of the provinces have not acted together. Everyone is of his own
mind, and no two minds are alike. No effort was made to profit by the great
victory last year on the shores of Andiatarocte. Waraiyageh, sore in body
and mind, rests at home, so it is not possible that our people have been
ready and vigorous."

"While the French and Indians are all that we are not?"

"Even so. Montcalm advances with great speed, and knows precisely what he
intends to do. He has had plenty of time to reach our forts below. His
force is overwhelming, though more so in preparation and decision, than in
numbers. He has had time to strike, and being Montcalm, therefore he has
struck. There is no chance of error, O, Dagaeoga and Great Bear, when I
tell you a heavy blow has fallen upon us."

"I don't want to believe you, Tayoga," said the hunter, "but I do. The
conclusion seems inevitable to me."

"I'm hoping when hope's but faint," said Robert.

They swung again into the great trail, left by the army of Montcalm, or at
least a part of it, and the Onondaga and the hunter told its tale with
precision.

"Here passed the cannon," said Tayoga. "I judge by the size of the ruts the
wheels made that a battery of twelve pounders went this way. What do you
say, Great Bear?"

"You're right, of course, Tayoga, and there were eight guns in the battery;
a child could tell their number. They had other batteries too."

"And the wooden walls of our forts wouldn't stand much chance against a
continuous fire of twelve and eighteen pounders," said Robert.

"No," said Willet. "The forts could be saved only by enterprising and
skillful commanders who would drive away the batteries."

"Here went the warriors," said Tayoga. "They were on the outer edges of the
great trail, walking lightly, according to their custom. See the traces of
the moccasins, scores and scores of them. We will come very soon to a place
where the whole army camped for the night. How do I know, O, Dagaeoga?
Because numerous trails are coming in from the forest and converging upon
one point. They do that because it is time to gather for food and the
night's rest. Some of the warriors went into the forest to hunt game, and
they found it, too. Look at the drops of blood, still faintly showing on
the grass, leading here, and here, and here into the main trail, drops that
fell from the deer they had slain. Also they shot birds. Behold feathers
hanging on the bushes, blown there by the wind, which proves that the site
of their camp is very near, as I said."

"It's just over the hill in that wide, shallow valley," said Willet.

They entered the valley which had been marked by the departed army with
signs as clear as the print of a book for the Onondaga and the hunter to
read.

"Here at the northern end of the valley is where the warriors cooked and
ate the deer they had slain," said Tayoga. "The bones are scattered all
about, and we see the ashes of their fires, but they kept mostly to
themselves, because few footprints of white men lead to the place they set
aside as their own. Just beyond them the cannon were parked. All this is
very simple. An Onondaga child eight years old could read what is written
in this camp. Here are the impressions made by the cannon wheels, and just
beside them the artillery horses were tethered, as the numerous hoofprints
show."

"And here, I imagine," said Robert, who had walked on, "the Marquis de
Montcalm and his lieutenants spent the night. Tents were pitched for them.
You can see the holes left by the pegs."

"Spoken truly, O, Dagaeoga. You are using eye and mind, and lo! you are
showing once more the beginnings of wisdom. Four tents were pitched. The
rest of the army slept in the open. Montcalm and his lieutenants
themselves would have done so, but the setting up of the tents inspired
respect in the warriors and even in the troops. The French leaders have
mind and they profit by it. They neglect no precaution, no detail to
increase their prestige and maintain their authority."

"It is so, Tayoga," said Willet, "and I can wish that our own officers
would do the same. The French are marvelously expert in dealing with
Indians. They can handle them all, except the Hodenosaunee. But don't you
think they held a short council here by this log, after they had eaten
their suppers?"

"It cannot be doubted, Great Bear. Montcalm and his captains sat on the
log. The Indian chiefs sat in a half circle before it, and they smoked a
pipe. See, the traces of the ashes on the grass. They were planning the
attack upon the fort. It is bound to be William Henry, because the trail
leads in that direction."

"And these marks on the log, Tayoga, show that there was some indecision,
at first, and much talking. Two or three of the French officers had their
hunting knives in their hands, and they carved nervously at the log, just
as a man will often whittle as he argues."

"Well stated, O, Great Bear. After the conference, the chiefs went back in
single file to their own part of the camp. Here goes their trail, and you
can nearly fancy that all stepped exactly in the footprints of the first."

"The straight, decisive line proves too, Tayoga, that the plan was
completed and everything ready for the attack. The chiefs would not have
gone away in such a manner if they had not been satisfied."

"Well stated again, Great Bear. The Marquis de Montcalm also went directly
back to his tent. See, where the boot heels pressed."

"But you have no way of knowing," said Robert, "that the traces of boot
heels indicate the Marquis."

"O, Dagaeoga, after all my teaching, you forget again that mind can see
where the eye cannot. Train the mind! Train the mind, and you will get much
profit from it. The traces of these boot heels lead directly to the place
where the largest tent stood. We know it was the largest, because the holes
left by the tent pegs are farthest apart. And we know it belonged to the
Marquis de Montcalm, because, always having that keen eye for effect, the
French Commander-in-Chief would have no tent but the largest."

"True as Gospel, Tayoga," said the hunter, "and the French officers
themselves had a little conference in the tent of the Marquis, after they
had finished with the Indian chiefs. Here, within the square made by the
pegs, are the prints of many boot heels and they were not all made by the
Marquis, since they are of different sizes. Probably they were completing
some plans in regard to the artillery, since the warriors would have
nothing to do with the big guns. Here are ashes, too, in the corner near
one of the pegs. I think it likely that the Marquis smoked a thoughtful
pipe after all the others had gone."

"Aye, Dave," said Robert, "and he had much to think about. The officers
from Europe find things tremendously changed when they come from their
open fields into this mighty wilderness. We know what happened to Braddock,
because we saw it, and we had a part in it. I can understand his mistake.
How could a soldier from Europe read the signs of the forest, signs that he
had never seen before, and foresee the ambush?"

"He couldn't, Robert, lad, but while countries change in character men
themselves don't. Braddock was brave, but he should have remembered that he
was not in Europe. The Marquis de Montcalm remembers it. He made no mistake
at Oswego and he is making none here. He took the Indian chiefs into
council, as we have just seen. He placates them, he humors their whims, and
he draws out of them their full fighting power to be used for the French
cause."

Tayoga ranged about the shallow valley a little, and announced that the
whole force had gone on together the morning after the encampment.

"The artillery and the infantry were in close ranks," he said, "and the
warriors were on either flank, scouting in the forest, forming a fringe
which kept off possible scouts of the English and Americans. There was no
chance of a surprise attack which would cut up the forces of Montcalm and
impede his advance."

Willet sighed.

"The Marquis, although he may not have known it," he said, "was in no
danger from such an enterprise. We have read the signs too well, Tayoga.
Our own people have been lying in their forts, weak of will, waiting to
defend themselves, while the French and their allies have had all the
wilderness to range over, and in which they might do as they pleased. It is
easy to see where the advantage lies."

"And we shall soon learn what has happened," said Tayoga, gravely.

The next morning they met an American scout who told them the terrible news
of the capture of Fort William Henry, with its entire garrison, by
Montcalm, and the slaughter afterward of many of the prisoners by the
Indians.

Robert was appalled.

"Is Lake George to remain our only victory?" he exclaimed.

"It's better to have a bad beginning and a good ending than a good
beginning and a bad ending," said the scout.

"Remember," said Tayoga, "how Areskoui watched over us, when we were among
the peaks. As he watched over us then so later on he will watch over our
cause."

"It was only for a moment that I felt despair," said Robert. "It is certain
that victory always comes to those who know how to work and wait."

Courage rose anew in their hearts, and once more they sped southward,
resolved to make greater efforts than any that had gone before.
