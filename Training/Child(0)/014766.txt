Transcriber's Notes:

Welcome to the schoolroom of 1900. The moral tone is
plain. "She is kind to the old blind man."

The exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful
than some contemporary alternatives. Much is left to the
teacher. Explanations given in the text are enough to get
started teaching a child to read and write. Counting in
Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson
numbers.

There is no text version because much of the material uses
specialized characters that have no ASCI equivalent.
Wherever possible the "ASCI" text has been converted.

The "non-ASCI" text remains as images.  The "non-ASCI"
text is approximated in text boxes to right of the image, as
are script images.

The form of contractions includes a space. The
contemporary word "don't" was rendered as "do n't".

The author, not listed in the text is William Holmes
McGuffey.

The long continued popularity of MCGUFFEY'S
READERS is sufficient evidence of the positive merits of
the books. The aim of this revision has been to preserve
unimpaired the distinctive features of the series, and at the
same time to present the matter in a new dress, with new
type, new illustrations, and with a considerable amount of
new matter.
Spelling exercises are continued through the first half of
the THIRD READER. These exercises, with those furnished
in the two lower books, are exhaustive of the words
employed in the reading lessons. Words are not repeated in
the vocabularies.
In the latter half of the book, definitions are introduced. It
is hoped that the teacher will extend this defining exercise to
all the words of the lesson liable to be misunderstood. The
child should define the word in his own language sufficiently
to show that he has a mastery of the word in its use.
Drills in articulation and emphasis should be given with
every lesson. The essentials of good reading are not to be
taught by one or two lessons. Constant drill on good
exercises, with frequent exhibitions of the correct method
from the teacher, will be found more effectual than any form
prescribed in type.
If the pupils are not familiar with the diacritical marks,
they should be carefully taught; such instruction constitutes
an excellent drill on articulation, and enables the pupils to
use the dictionary with intelligence.

INTRODUCTION.

ARTICULATION.

A distinct articulation can only be gained by constant and
careful practice of the elementary sounds.
Whenever a word is imperfectly enunciated, the teacher
should call attention to the sounds composing the spoken
word.
If the pupil fails to sound any element correctly, as in the
case of lisping, the fault can be overcome by calling
attention to the correct position of the organs of speech, and
insisting upon exact execution. Except in case of
malformation of these organs, every pupil should sound each
element correctly before such drill should cease.

EMPHASIS.

NOTE.--If the pupil has received proper oral instruction,
he has been taught to understand what he has read, and has
already acquired the habit of emphasizing words. He is now
prepared for a more formal introduction to the SUBJECT of
emphasis, and for more particular attention to its first
PRINCIPLES. This lesson, and the examples given, should
be repeatedly practiced.
In reading and in talking, we always speak some words
with more force than others. We do this, because the
meaning of what we say depends most upon these words.
If I wish to know whether it is George or his brother who
is sick, I speak the words George and brother with more
force than the other words. I say, Is it George or his brother
who is sick?
This greater force with which we speak the words is called
EMPHASIS.
The words upon which emphasis is put, are sometimes
printed in slanting letters, called Italics,* and sometimes in
CAPITALS.
The words printed in Italics in the following questions and
answers, should be read with more force than the other
words, that is, with emphasis.
Did you ride to town yesterday? No, my brother, did.
Did yon ride to town yesterday? No, I walked.

* Italics are also used for other purposes, though most
frequently for emphasis.

	 	THIRD READER. 	11

Did you ride to town yesterday? No, I went into the
country.
Did you ride to town yesterday? No, I went the day before.
Have you seen James or John lately? I have seen James,
but not John.
Did you say there were four eggs in the nest, or three?
There were only three eggs, not four.
Were the eggs white or blue? The eggs were white, not
blue.
Had the boy a hat on his head, or a cap? He had a cap on,
not a hat.

PUNCTUATION.

Punctuation should be thoroughly studied by the pupil, in
order that he may become perfectly familiar with the marks
and pauses found in the reading lessons of this volume.

MARKS AND PAUSES.

These marks are used to point off written or printed matter
into sentences and parts of sentences, and thus to assist the
reader in obtaining the meaning of the writer. They seldom
indicate the length of the pause to be made; this must be
determined by the sense.
A Hyphen (-) is used between syllables in a word divided at
the end of a line; as, "be-cause," "ques-tion," and between the
parts of a compound word; as,
Rocking-chair, good-by.

 12	ECLECTIC SERIES.

The Comma (,), Semicolon (;), and Colon (:) mark
grammatical divisions in a sentence; as,
God is good; for he gives us all things.
Be wise to-day, my child: 't is madness to defer.

A Period (.) is placed at the end of a sentence; as,
God is love. Life is short.
Or is used after an abbreviation; as,
Dr. Murphy. Jan. 10, 1879.

An Interrogation Point (?) denotes a question; as,
Has he come? Who are you?

An Exclamation Point (!) denotes strong feeling; as,
O Absalom! my son! my son!

The Dash (--) is used where there is a sudden break or
pause in a sentence; as,
The truth has power--such is God's will--to make us better.

Quotation Marks (" ") denote the words of another; as,
God said, "Let there be light."

An Apostrophe (') denotes that a letter or letters are left
out; as,
O'er, for over; 't is, for it is.
And is also used to show ownership; as,
The man's hat. Helen's book.

LESSON I.


THE SHEPHERD BOY.

1. Little Roy led his sheep down to pasture,
And his cows, by the side of the brook;

(13)

	14 	ECLECTIC SERIES.

But his cows never drank any water,
   And his sheep never needed a crook.

2. For the pasture was gay as a garden,
   And it glowed with a flowery red;
But the meadows had never a grass blade,
  And the brooklet--it slept in its bed:

3. And it lay without sparkle or murmur,
   Nor reflected the blue of the skies;
But the music was made by the shepherd,
   And the sparkle was all in his eyes.

4. Oh, he sang like a bird in the summer!
  And, if sometimes you fancied a bleat,
That, too, was the voice of the shepherd,
  And not of the lambs at his feet.

5. And the glossy brown cows were so gentle
  That they moved at the touch of his hand
O'er the wonderful, rosy-red meadow,
  And they stood at the word of command.

6. So he led all his sheep to the pasture,
  And his cows, by the side of the brook;
Though it rained, yet the rain never pattered
  O'er the beautiful way that they took.

7. And it was n't in Fairyland either,
  But a house in the midst of the town,
Where Roy, as he looked from the window,
  Saw the silvery drops trickle down.

	 	THIRD READER. 	15

8. For his pasture was only a table,
   With its cover so flowery fair,
And his brooklet was just a green ribbon,
   That his sister had lost from her hair.

9. And his cows were but glossy horse-chestnuts,
   That had grown on his grandfather's tree;
And his sheep only snowy-white pebbles,
   He had brought from the shore of the sea.

10. And at length when the shepherd was weary,
   And had taken his milk and his bread,
And his mother had kissed him and tucked him,
   And had bid him "good night" in his bed;

11. Then there entered his big brother Walter,
   While the shepherd was soundly asleep,
And he cut up the cows into baskets,
   And to jackstones turned all of the sheep.

LESSON II.


JOHNNY'S FIRST SNOWSTORM.

1. Johnny Reed was a little boy who never
had seen a snowstorm till he was six years old.
Before this, he had lived in a warm country,
where the sun shines down on beautiful

	16 	ECLECTIC SERIES.
orange groves, and fields always sweet with  flowers.
2. But now he had come to visit his grandmother, who
lived where the snow falls in winter. Johnny was standing at
the window when the snow came down.

3. "O mamma!" he cried, joyfully, "do come quick, and
see these little white birds flying down from heaven."
4. "They are not birds, Johnny," said mamma, smiling.
5. "Then maybe the little angels are losing their feathers!
Oh! do tell me what it is; is it sugar? Let me taste it," said
