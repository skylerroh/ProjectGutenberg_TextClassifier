never was any real danger. Johnny was just teaching them, so that when
danger did come, as it surely would, sooner or later, they would know
just what to do.

It surely was a funny little school, and sometimes Sammy Jay had hard
work to keep from laughing right out.




XXIV. SAMMY JAY PROVES THAT HE IS NOT ALL BAD


Sammy Jay hadn't had so much fun for a long time as he found in watching
the funny little school in Farmer Brown's old orchard, where Johnny
Chuck was teaching his three baby Chucks the things that every little
Chuck must learn, if he would grow up into a big Chuck. When they had
learned to mind without waiting to ask why, and had learned the signals
which told them just what to do when danger was near, Johnny began to
lead them farther and farther away from home.

He took them up along the old stone wall and showed them how to find
safe hiding-places among the stones. Then he took them off a little way
and suddenly gave the danger signal. It was funny, very funny indeed to
see the three little Chucks scamper for the old stone wall and crawl out
of sight.

The first time, two of them tried to squeeze into the same hole
together, and each was in such a hurry that he wouldn't let the other
go first. Then both lost their tempers and they began to fight about it,
quite forgetting that if there was really any danger near, they surely
would come to harm. Such a scolding as Johnny Chuck did give those two
little Chucks! Then he made them try it all over again.

Once he found a foot print which Reddy Fox had made in some soft earth
during the night, and made each little Chuck smell of it, while he told
them all about Reddy and old Granny Fox and how smart and sly they were
and how very, very fond they were of tender young Chucks for dinner.

The three little Chucks shivered when they smelled of Reddy's track, and
the hair along their backs stood up in a way that was very funny to see.

Then Johnny Chuck took them over to the edge of the old orchard, where
they could peep out over the Green Meadows. He pointed out old Whitetail
the Marshhawk, sailing back and forth over the meadows, and told them
how once, when he was a little Chuck and had run away from home, old
Whitetail had nearly caught him. He told them about Farmer Brown's boy
and about Bowser the Hound and a great many other things that little
Chucks should learn about.

Now all the time that Johnny Chuck was teaching these things, he was
keeping the sharpest kind of a watch for danger, and there were many
times when he would give the danger signal. Then they would all lie flat
down in the grass and keep perfectly still, or else scamper as fast as
they could along the little paths which Johnny had made, to the safety
of the snug home under the old apple-tree. But even the most watchful
are surprised sometimes.

One morning, when Johnny Chuck had led the three little Chucks farther
from home than usual, Farmer Brown's boy took it into his head to visit
the old orchard. Johnny Chuck did not see him coming. You see, the
orchard grass had grown so tall that even when he sat up his very
straightest, Johnny could not always see over the top of it. So this
morning he failed to see Farmer Brown's boy coming.

But Sammy Jay, sitting in his snug hiding-place in the top of one of
the old apple-trees, saw him. At first Sammy Jay's sharp eyes twinkled.
There would be some fun now! Perhaps Farmer Brown's boy would catch one
of the little Chucks! Sammy Jay could picture to himself the fright of
Johnny Chuck and the three little Chucks. He fairly hugged himself in
delight, for you know Sammy Jay dearly loves to see other people in
trouble.

Then he thought of all the fun he had had watching those three little
Chucks learn their lessons, and suddenly the thought of anything
happening to them made Sammy Jay feel uncomfortable. Almost without
stopping to think, he screamed at the top of his lungs:

"Run, Johnny Chuck, run! Here comes Farmer Brown's boy!"

And Johnny Chuck ran. He didn't wait to ask questions or even to look.
He started the three little Chucks ahead of him, and he nipped their
heels to make them run faster. And just in time they reached the snug
house under the old apple-tree in the far corner.

Farmer Brown's boy was just in time to see them disappear. He watched
Sammy Jay flying over to the Green Forest and screaming "Thief! thief!"
as he flew.

"I wonder now if that jay warned those chucks purposely," said he, as he
scratched his head thoughtfully.

If Peter Rabbit had been there, he could have told him that Sammy Jay
did, for he knows all about Sammy Jay and his tricks. But Peter wasn't
there. The fact is, Peter was very busy doing the most foolish of all
the foolish things he has ever done--trying to change his name. You
may read all about it in The Adventures of Peter Cottontail. You see it
takes a whole book to tell all about Peter and his doings.
