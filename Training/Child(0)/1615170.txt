      feet,
  And each hath a dream that is tiny and fleet--
  She bringeth her poppies to you, my sweet,
    When she findeth you sleeping!

  There is one little dream of a beautiful drum--
    "Rub-a-dub!" it goeth;
  There is one little dream of a big sugar-plum,
  And lo! thick and fast the other dreams come
  Of pop-guns that bang, and tin tops that hum,
    And a trumpet that bloweth!

  And dollies peep out of those wee little dreams
    With laughter and singing;
  And boats go a-floating on silvery streams,
  And the stars peek-a-boo with their own misty gleams,
  And up, up, and up, where the Mother Moon beams,
    The fairies go winging!

  Would you dream all these dreams that are tiny and fleet?
    They'll come to you sleeping;
  So shut the two eyes that are weary, my sweet,
  For the Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby street
  With poppies that hang from her head to her feet,
    Comes stealing; comes creeping.

THE SANDMAN


  The rosy clouds float overhead,
    The sun is going down;
  And now the sandman's gentle tread
    Comes stealing through the town.
  "White sand, white sand," he softly cries,
    And as he shakes his hand,
  Straightway there lies on babies' eyes
    His gift of shining sand.
  Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown,
  As shuts the rose, they softly close,
    When he goes through the town.

  From sunny beaches far away--
    Yes, in another land--
  He gathers up at break of day
    His store of shining sand.
  No tempests beat that shore remote,
    No ships may sail that way;
  His little boat alone may float
    Within that lovely bay.
  Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown,
  As shuts the rose, they softly close,
    When he goes through the town.

[Illustration: The sandman]

  He smiles to see the eyelids close
    Above the happy eyes;
  And every child right well he knows,
    Oh, he is very wise!
  But, if as he goes through the land,
    A naughty baby cries,
  His other hand takes dull gray sand
    To close the wakeful eyes.
  Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown,
  As shuts the rose, they softly close,
    When he goes through the town.

  So when you hear the sandman's song
    Sound through the twilight sweet,
  Be sure you do not keep him long
    A-waiting on the street.
  Lie softly down, dear little head,
    Rest quiet, busy hands,
  Till, by your bed his good-night said,
    He strews the shining sands.
  Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown,
  As shuts the rose, they softly close,
    When he goes through the town.
