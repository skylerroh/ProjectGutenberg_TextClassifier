The Loss of John Humble: What Led to It, and what Came of It. By G.

Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges, _5s._

     John Humble, an orphan, is sent to sea with his Uncle Rolf, the
     captain of the _Erl King_, but in the course of certain adventures
     off the English coast, in which Rolf shows both skill and courage,
     the boy is left behind at Portsmouth. He escapes from an English
     gun-brig to a Norwegian vessel, the _Thor_, which is driven from
     her course in a voyage to Hammerfest, and wrecked on a desolate
     shore. The survivors experience the miseries of a long sojourn in
     the Arctic circle, with inadequate means of supporting life, but
     ultimately, with the aid of some friendly but thievish Lapps, they
     succeed in making their way to a reindeer station and so southward
     to Tornea and home again. The story throughout is singularly vivid
     and truthful in its details, the individual characters are fresh
     and well marked, and a pleasant vein of humour relieves the stress
     of the more tragic incidents in the story.

     Mr. Hutcheson's reputation for the realistic treatment of life at
     sea will be fully sustained by the present volume--the narrative of
     a boy's experiences on board ship during his first voyage. From the
     stowing of the vessel in the Thames to her recovery from the Pratas
     Reef on which she is stranded, everything is described with the
     accuracy of perfect practical knowledge of ships and sailors; and
     the incidents of the story range from the broad humours of the
     fo'c's'le to the perils of flight from and fight with the pirates
     of the China Seas. The captain, the mate, the Irish boatswain, the
     Portuguese steward, and the Chinese cook, are fresh and
     cleverly-drawn characters, and the reader throughout has the sense
     that he is on a real voyage with living men.

     Ecuador, where the abducted boy has become an Indian chief.
     Afterwards he is discovered on an island which had been used as a

     When the vicar's wife proposed to call Mrs. White's daughter by the
     heathen name of Lilac, all the villagers shook their heads; and
     they continued to shake them sagely when Lilac's father was shot
     dead by poachers just before the christening, and when, years
     after, her mother died on the very day Lilac was crowned Queen of
     the May. And yet White Lilac proved a fortune to the relatives to
     whose charge she fell--a veritable good brownie, who brought luck
     wherever she went. The story of her life forms a most readable and
     admirable rustic idyl, and is told with a fine sense of rustic
     character.
