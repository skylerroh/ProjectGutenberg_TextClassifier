  To the pike, the Maskenozha,
  "Take the bait of this rude fellow,
  Break the line of Hiawatha!"

  In his fingers Hiawatha
  Felt the loose line jerk and tighten;
  As he drew it in, it tugged so
  That the birch canoe stood endwise,
  Like a birch log in the water,
  With the squirrel, Adjidaumo,
  Perched and frisking on the summit.

  Full of scorn was Hiawatha
  When he saw the fish rise upward,
  Saw the pike, the Maskenozha,
  Coming nearer, nearer to him,
  And he shouted through the water,
  "Esa! esa! shame upon you!
  You are but the pike, Kenozha,
  You are not the fish I wanted,
  You are not the King of Fishes!"

  Reeling downward to the bottom
  Sank the pike in great confusion,
  And the mighty sturgeon, Nahma,
  Said to Ugudwash, the sun-fish,
  To the bream, with scales of crimson,
  "Take the bait of this great boaster,
  Break the line of Hiawatha!"

  Slowly upward, wavering, gleaming,
  Rose the Ugudwash, the sun-fish,
  Seized the line of Hiawatha,
  Swung with all his weight upon it,
  Made a whirlpool in the water,
  Whirled the birch canoe in circles,
  Round and round in gurgling eddies,
  Till the circles in the water
  Reached the far-off sandy beaches,
  Till the water-flags and rushes
  Nodded on the distant margins.

  But when Hiawatha saw him
  Slowly rising through the water,
  Lifting up his disk refulgent,
  Loud he shouted in derision,
  "Esa! esa! shame upon you!
  You are Ugudwash, the sun-fish,
  You are not the fish I wanted,
  You are not the King of Fishes!"

  Slowly downward, wavering, gleaming,
  Sank the Ugudwash, the sun-fish,
  And again the sturgeon, Nahma,
  Heard the shout of Hiawatha,
  Heard his challenge of defiance,
  The unnecessary tumult,
  Ringing far across the water.

  From the white sand of the bottom
  Up he rose with angry gesture,
  Quivering in each nerve and fibre,
  Clashing all his plates of armor,
  Gleaming bright with all his war-paint;
  In his wrath he darted upward,
  Flashing leaped into the sunshine,
  Opened his great jaws, and swallowed
  Both canoe and Hiawatha.

  Down into that darksome cavern
  Plunged the headlong Hiawatha,
  As a log on some black river
  Shoots and plunges down the rapids,
  Found himself in utter darkness,
  Groped about in helpless wonder,
  Till he felt a great heart beating,
  Throbbing in that utter darkness.

  And he smote it in his anger,
  With his fist, the heart of Nahma.
  Felt the mighty King of Fishes
  Shudder through each nerve and fibre,
  Heard the water gurgle round him
  As he leaped and staggered through it,
  Sick at heart, and faint and weary.

  Crosswise then did Hiawatha
  Drag his birch-canoe for safety,
  Lest from out the jaws of Nahma,
  In the turmoil and confusion,
  Forth he might be hurled and perish.
  And the squirrel, Adjidaumo,
  Frisked and chattered very gayly,
  Toiled and tugged with Hiawatha
  Till the labor was completed.

  Then said Hiawatha to him,
  "O my little friend, the squirrel,
  Bravely have you toiled to help me;
  Take the thanks of Hiawatha,
  And the name which now he gives you;
  For hereafter and forever
  Boys shall call you Adjidaumo,
  Tail-in-air the boys shall call you!"

  And again the sturgeon, Nahma,
  Gasped and quivered in the water,
  Then was still, and drifted landward
  Till he grated on the pebbles,
  Till the listening Hiawatha
  Heard him grate upon the margin,
  Felt him strand upon the pebbles,
  Knew that Nahma, King of Fishes,
  Lay there dead upon the margin.

  Then he heard a clang and flapping,
  As of many wings assembling,
  Heard a screaming and confusion,
  As of birds of prey contending,
  Saw a gleam of light above him,
  Shining through the ribs of Nahma,
  Saw the glittering eyes of sea-gulls,
  Of Kayoshk, the sea-gulls, peering,
  Gazing at him through the opening,
  Heard them saying to each other,
  "'T is our brother, Hiawatha!"

  And he shouted from below them,
  Cried exulting from the caverns:
  "O ye sea-gulls! O my brothers!
  I have slain the sturgeon, Nahma;
  Make the rifts a little larger,
  With your claws the openings widen,
  Set me free from this dark prison,
  And henceforward and forever
  Men shall speak of your achievements,
  Calling you Kayoshk, the sea-gulls,
  Yes, Kayoshk, the Noble Scratchers!"

  And the wild and clamorous sea-gulls
  Toiled with beak and claws together,
  Made the rifts and openings wider
  In the mighty ribs of Nahma,
  And from peril and from prison,
  From the body of the sturgeon,
  From the peril of the water,
  They released my Hiawatha.

  He was standing near his wigwam,
  On the margin of the water,
  And he called to old Nokomis,
  Called and beckoned to Nokomis,
  Pointed to the sturgeon, Nahma,
  Lying lifeless on the pebbles,
  With the sea-gulls feeding on him.

  "I have slain the Mishe-Nahma,
  Slain the King of Fishes!" said he;
  "Look! the sea-gulls feed upon him,
  Yes, my friends Kayoshk, the sea-gulls;
  Drive them not away, Nokomis,
  They have saved me from great peril
  In the body of the sturgeon,
  Wait until their meal is ended,
  Till their craws are full with feasting,
  Till they homeward fly, at sunset,
  To their nests among the marshes;
  Then bring all your pots and kettles,
  And make oil for us in Winter."

  And she waited till the sun set,
  Till the pallid moon, the Night-sun,
  Rose above the tranquil water,
  Till Kayoshk, the sated sea-gulls,
  From their banquet rose with clamor,
  And across the fiery sunset
  Winged their way to far-off islands,
  To their nests among the rushes.

  To his sleep went Hiawatha,
  And Nokomis to her labor,
  Toiling patient in the moonlight,
  Till the sun and moon changed places,
  Till the sky was red with sunrise,
  And Kayoshk, the hungry sea-gulls,
  Came back from the reedy islands,
  Clamorous for their morning banquet.

  Three whole days and nights alternate
  Old Nokomis and the sea-gulls
  Stripped the oily flesh of Nahma,
  Till the waves washed through the rib-bones,
  Till the sea-gulls came no longer,
  And upon the sands lay nothing
  But the skeleton of Nahma.




[Illustration: THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP          _C. W. Ashley_
      The sun shone on her golden hair,
        And her cheek was glowing fresh and fair ]



  THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP


  "Build me straight, O worthy Master!
    Stanch and strong, a goodly vessel,
  That shall laugh at all disaster,
    And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!"

  The merchant's word
  Delighted the Master heard;
  For his heart was in his work, and the heart
  Giveth grace unto every Art.
  A quiet smile played round his lips,
  As the eddies and dimples of the tide
  Play round the bows of ships,
  That steadily at anchor ride.
  And with a voice that was full of glee,
  He answered, "Erelong we will launch
  A vessel as goodly, and strong, and stanch,
  As ever weathered a wintry sea!"
  And first with nicest skill and art,
  Perfect and finished in every part,
  A little model the Master wrought,
  Which should be to the larger plan
  What the child is to the man,
  Its counterpart in miniature;
  That with a hand more swift and sure
  The greater labor might be brought
  To answer to his inward thought.
  And as he labored, his mind ran o'er
  The various ships that were built of yore,
  And above them all, and strangest of all
  Towered the Great Harry, crank and tall,
  Whose picture was hanging on the wall,
  With bows and stern raised high in air,
  And balconies hanging here and there,
  And signal lanterns and flags afloat,
  And eight round towers, like those that frown
  From some old castle, looking down
  Upon the drawbridge and the moat.
  And he said with a smile, "Our ship, I wis,
  Shall be of another form than this!"
  It was of another form, indeed;
  Built for freight, and yet for speed,
  A beautiful and gallant craft;
  Broad in the beam, that the stress of the blast,
  Pressing down upon sail and mast,
  Might not the sharp bows overwhelm;
  Broad in the beam, but sloping aft
  With graceful curve and slow degrees,
  That she might be docile to the helm,
  And that the currents of parted seas,
  Closing behind, with mighty force,
