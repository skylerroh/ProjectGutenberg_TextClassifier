Miss Wright's aim in this new volume has been to bring to the attention
of young readers a summary, set forth in simple, attractive language, of
the lives and works of the great men of English Literature. Especial
stress is laid upon popular literature, the old British and Saxon Songs,
the romantic episodes of King Arthur's reign in its relation to
learning, Robin Hood, etc. The book is written in a charmingly winning
style, and is both entertaining and valuable as a first book of English
literature.

Stockton works out with his customary ingenuity and cleverness.

Here we have one of those audacious stories which Frenchmen alone seem
to have enough originality to invent. Captain Mago is sent by Hiram King
of Tyre, on a voyage to Tarshish (Spain) to procure a supply of silver
and other treasure with which to embellish the temple of David, King of
the Jews, which was to be erected at Jerusalem. During his absence of
several years, he met with innumerable strange and perilous adventures
by land and sea. In itself the narrative of his exploits is of thrilling
interest, but the real value of the book consists in the graphic and
accurate picture which it gives of the world as it was a thousand years
before the Christian Era. King David, King Solomon, the Queen of Sheba,
and even Homer are among the characters Captain Mago meets in his
journeys and adventures.

A book of exciting adventures, the scene being laid in India during the
Mutiny of 1857, and the story describing the fortunes of a Franco-Indian
family.

"The book, the plot of which appears to be founded on fact, is rather a
boy's book than a novel, and is filled with an uninterrupted series of
wild adventures, told in an agreeable and interesting way."
--_The Nation._

"Besides the interest in the romance, much information is conveyed
concerning Indian manners and customs, as well as delightful
descriptions of the wild country and the animals that abound there."

The author of this book is famous for his hunting exploits in Africa and
in Asia. His narrative has an autobiographical basis and contains some
of the most marvelous stories of adventure ever published. Col. Gordon's
accounts of his various expeditions are records of bravery and endurance
seldom paralleled; and the tales of bloodshed are alleviated by pleasant
anecdote--the humors of the camp and chase.
