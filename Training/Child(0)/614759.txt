Novel Bonfire

The author experienced something very unusual one Sunday afternoon in a
camp where he was invited to speak. The talk was on "Trees or Growth," one
of the studies of the course described. During the talk a number of things
were referred to that enter into the growth of a tree which either mar or
hinder it from becoming a symmetrical, beautiful tree and a similar
comparison was made regarding a boy's growth. The question was asked of
the boys, "What are some of the things which interfere with a boy's growth
physically, mentally and morally?" A number of things, such as smoking,
swearing, impurity, etc., were given, and finally one of the small boys
piped up "reading dime novels." His answer was received with howls of
derision, especially from the older boys.  "Hold on," I said, "let's
discuss the matter; if dime novels are good for a boy's growth mentally,
we want to know about it, but if they are detrimental to this particular
kind of desired growth, of course, we want to cut it out." The discussion
brought out the fact that a number of the boys had smuggled a lot of this
kind of literature into camp and were just loafing through their time in
the woods, gloating over the wonderful and daring escapades of Wild West
heroes. The boys finally decided that their mental growth was retarded by
such reading. Then came the question, "What are you going to do about it?"
"We don't usually have a bonfire on Sunday," I said. "I am inclined,
however, to ask your leader for a special dispensation and we will have
one.

You are to furnish the fuel, your leader the kerosene oil and I will
provide the match. The fuel is to consist of all the dime novels in the
camp." "Whew!" "I know it will take grit to do this, but it is a test of
your sincerity and determination to progress along right lines." "We're
game?" yelled the boys, "and we mean business."

The start was made for the place where the bonfires were usually held. By
the time I reached the spot, the boys were coming from their tents with
bundles of novels. Every boy was requested to tear each novel in half and
throw it upon the heap. When everything was ready, the boys uncovered and
in the silence that came upon the group, the match was struck and the
flames began to leap upward, until finally, all that remained was the
small piles of ashes. For the majority of the boys it meant the burning up
of the dross and the beginning of better and nobler thinking. I shall
always remember this novel bonfire. This is what I mean by making Bible
study and camp talks effective.

Reading

Sunday afternoon is the time for reading good, wholesome stories. Take the
boys out into the woods where they can squat under a big tree, or if the
day is warm seek the cool shelter of the tent and while the boys are lying
down read a short story or several chapters of a story like "Dr.
Grenfell's Parish," by Norman Duncan, "Just Boys," by Mary Buell Wood,
"Some Boys I Know," "Chapel Talks," or "The Story of Good Will Farm," by
George W. Hinckley. If the group is made up of older boys who like to
discuss life problems, read a chapter or two from Robert Speer's excellent
books, "A Young Man's Questions" and "Young Men Who Overcame." Make sure
that whatever you read has the uplift note. The real purpose of the
afternoon's reading should be that of instilling in the boys' minds some
of the cardinal virtues of Christian character.

Don't moralize; let the story do its own moralizing. Boys are hero
worshippers. If the hero or the heroic appeal of the story is of a sane
type and not abnormal there will be created naturally within the boy a
desire to emulate the good deeds of the hero in the everyday life of the
camp, which is much better than the parrot-like vocalization unfortunately
many times encouraged by well-meaning men.

Chapel

A pile of stones made to serve as an altar or pulpit, a chapel having the
branches of a friendly pine as its roof and under which are built a
reading desk and seats of white birch, a cathedral with towering columns
of pine and cushions of pine needles, a rocky shore along the ocean--all
are places where boys have heard the appeal for right living and responded
with an earnest decision that marked an advance step in their moral and
religious growth.

Make much of the music at these outdoor services on Sunday. A choir of men
and boys responding in the distance to the hymns of the camp boys, in
antiphonal manner, a cornetist playing a hymn in the distance, make an
impression never to be forgotten.

The great test of camp life is not the fun the boy had, or his gain in
weight, height or lung capacity, or the friendships formed, or his
increased knowledge in woodcraft, but his advancement in character-making
and gain in spiritual vigor.

We may live without friends, we may live without books,
But civilized man cannot live without cooks.

Good Cooking

The normal boy sums up life in two words of three letters each: "F-u-n"
and "E-a-t." As long as there is plenty of fun and plenty to eat, he
thinks life is worth living, and he is not so far from the truth, for it
is only when the fun of living dies within us, and our digestive apparatus
refuses to do its function that we "become of all men most miserable." A
boy will put up with all sorts of inconvenience but rebels at once at poor
food and bad cooking. The good nature, congenial atmosphere, and
contentedness of camp life is largely due to good cooking. Economize in
every other way, but think twice before cheap cooks are employed or a
cheap grade of food purchased.

[Illustration: Where They Eat to Live]

A good cook will economize, he knows what to do with left-overs and how to
prepare menus of variety. The quantity of swill soon reveals the worth of
the cook. In a large camp a hundred dollars may easily find its way into
the garbage can because of cheap cooks and poor food. A growing boy
demands relatively more of the tissue-building kind of food than a grown
person, because the body is being built up. When the full stature is
reached the tissue-building part of the food is only required to take the
place of that worn out each day. Professor Atwater has told us that the
boy of fifteen or sixteen requires ninety per cent of the food ration of
the adult man engaged in moderate muscular work. Boys at twelve require
seventy per cent.

Vegetables, fruits, cereals, bread, nuts and meats furnish the essentials.
Sugar and fat have only part of them. Coffee and tea have no food values
except for the milk and sugar added. They tend to check certain normal
secretion in the body and should not be used during growth.

Food Charts

The United States Department of Agriculture publishes a series of fifteen
food charts of exceptional value. Leaders and cooks will find them helpful
in providing and planning the food for the boys. Boys will be interested
in the information given and the attractive form of presentation. The set
costs $1.00. Send to Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D. C. The
following table is a condensation of the facts given on the charts, and
will help in planning menus:

Food naturally falls into four classes. Potatoes and grains furnish
starches. The starchy foods are heat and force producers. Eggs, meats,
nuts, milk, dried beans, peas and lentils furnish nitrogen, and are flesh
and muscle producers. Butter, oil, lard, and fatty meats supply fats.
Sugar, molasses, honey, fruit, etc., furnish sugar.

Starchy foods should be cooked at a high temperature and either boiled or
baked; nitrogenous and fatty foods at lower temperature, prolonging the
time. Meats are much better broiled, roasted, or stewed than fried.
Vegetables should be steamed or baked so that the juices may not be
wasted. Veal and pork (except ham and bacon) should have no place in the
menu of a boys' summer camp. Both require from four to five hours and
fifteen minutes to digest. Study carefully the above tables and then plan
your meals intelligently.
