Modern teachers of reading, however, recognize the saving of time and

The following aids are therefore offered in the belief that they will
make the work of the teacher, trained or untrained, more effective.

PHILEMON AND BAUCIS

I


Long ago, on a high hill in Greece, Philemon and Baucis lived.
