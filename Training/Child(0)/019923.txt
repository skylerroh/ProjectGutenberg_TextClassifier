PREFACE.


The selections in the HIGH SCHOOL READER have been chosen with the
belief that to pupils of such advancement as is required for entrance
into High Schools and Collegiate Institutes, oral reading should be
taught from the best literature, inasmuch as it not only affords a wide
range of thought and sentiment, but it also demands for its appropriate
vocal interpretation such powers of sympathy and appreciation as are
developed only by culture; and it is to impart culture that these
institutions of higher learning have been established.

Experience has shown that it is from their ordinary reading books that
pupils obtain their chief practical acquaintance with literature, and
the selections here presented have been made with this in remembrance.
They have been taken from the writings of authors of acknowledged
representative character; and they have been arranged for the most part
chronologically, so that pupils may unconsciously obtain some little
insight into the history of the development of the literary art. They
have also been so chosen as to convey a somewhat fair idea of the
relative value and productivity of authorship in the three great
English-speaking communities of the world--the mother countries, our
neighbours' country, and our own.

While a limited space, if nothing else, prevents the collection here
made from being a complete anthology, yet it does pretend to represent
the authors selected in characteristic moods, and (in so far as is
possible in a school book, and a reading text-book) to present a
somewhat fair perspective of the world of authorship. It may be said
that, if this be so, some names are conspicuously absent: McGee,
Canada's poet-orator; Parkman, who has given to our country a place in
the portraiture of nations; William Morris, the chief of the modern
school of romanticism; Tyndall, who of the literature of science has
made an art; Lamb, daintiest of humorists; Collins, "whose range of
flight," as Swinburne says, "was the highest of his generation." Either
from lack of space, or from some inherent unsuitableness in such
selections as might otherwise have been made, it was found impossible
to represent these names worthily; but as they are all more or less
adequately represented in the _Fourth Reader_, the teacher who may wish
to correct the perspective here presented may refer his pupils to the
pieces from these authors there given. It may be added, too, that
the body of recent literature is so enormous, that no adequate
representation of it (at any rate as regards quantity) is possible
within the limits of one book.

The selections in poetry, with but three necessary exceptions, are
complete wholes, and represent, as fairly as single pieces can, the
respective merits and styles of their authors. The selections in prose
cannot, of course, lay claim to this excellence; but they are all
complete in themselves, or have been made so by short introductions; and
it is hoped that they too are not unfairly representative of their
authors. In many cases they are of somewhat unusual length; by this,
however, they gain in interest and in representative character.

In some of the prose selections, passages have occasionally been
omitted, either because they interfered with the main narrative, or
because, as they added nothing to it, to omit them would be a gain of
space. In most cases these omissions are indicated by small asterisks.

All the selections, both in prose and in verse, have been made with
constant reference to their suitableness for the teaching of reading.
They are fitted to exemplify every mode of expression, except, perhaps,
that appropriate to a few of the stronger passions. It is not pretended
that they are all simple and easy. Many of them will require much
study and preparation before they can be read with that precision of
expression which is necessary to perfect intelligibility. The
chronological arrangement precludes grading; the teacher will decide
in what order the selections are to be read.

The introductory chapter is mainly intended to assist the teacher in
imparting to his pupils a somewhat scientific knowledge of the art of
reading. Of course the teacher will choose for himself his mode of
dealing with the chapter, but it has been written with the thought that
he should use it as a convenient series of texts, which he might expand
and illustrate in accordance with his opportunities and judgment.
Examples for illustration are indispensable to the successful study of
the principles described, and they should be sought for and obtained by
the teacher and pupils together (whenever possible they should be taken
from the READER), and should be kept labeled for reference and practice.
If the application of these principles be thus practically made by the
pupils themselves, they will receive a much more lasting impression of
their meaning and value than if the examples were given to them at no
cost of thought or search on their part.

To the teacher it is recommended that he should not be contented with
the short and necessarily imperfect exposition of the art of reading
therein given. The more familiar he is with the scientific principles
the more successfully will he be able to direct the studies and
practices of his pupils. Works on elocution are numerous and accessible.
Dr. Rush's _Philosophy of the Voice_ is perhaps the foundation of all
subsequent good work in the exposition of voice culture. Professor
Murdoch's _Analytic Elocution_ is an exhaustive and scholarly treatise
based upon it, and to the plan of treatment therein fully developed the
practical part of the introductory chapter has largely conformed.

The pleasing task remains of thanking those authors who have so kindly
responded to requests for permission to use selections from their works:
to President Wilson, for a sonnet from _Spring Wild Roses_, and for _Our
Ideal_; to Mr. Charles Sangster, for two sonnets from _Hesperus_; to Mr.
John Reade, for two poems from _The Prophecy of Merlin_; to Mr. Charles
Mair, for the scenes from _Tecumseh_; and to Professor C. G. D. Roberts,
for _To Winter_.

To Miss A. T. Jones, thanks are due for permission to use _Abigail
Becker_, recently published in the _Century Magazine_. The heroic acts
described in this poem seem so wonderful, so greatly superior to woman's
strength, even to human strength and endurance, to accomplish, that were
it possible to doubt its truthfulness, doubt one certainly would.
Nevertheless the poem is not only strictly in accordance with the facts,
it is even within and below them.
