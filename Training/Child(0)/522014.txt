

  Twenty little snowflakes climbing up a wire.
  "Now, listen," said their mother, "don't you climb up any higher.
  The sun will surely catch you, and scorch you with his fire."
  But the naughty little snowflakes didn't mind a word she said,
  Each tried to clamber faster than his fellow just ahead;
  They thought that they'd be back in time enough to go to bed.
  But they found out that their mother wasn't quite the dunce they
        thought her,
  The sun bobbed up--remember this, my little son and daughter--
  And turned those twenty snowflakes into twenty drops of water.

  SLIPPERY SLIM


  Slippery Slim, a garter snake,
  Leaned against a garden rake
  And smiled a sentimental smile
  At Tilly Toad, on the gravel pile,
  Till that bashful miss was forced to hop
  And hide her face in a carrot-top.




  [Illustration: THROUGH FOG AND RAIN I RUN MY TRAIN]

  THE FREIGHTER


  Through fog and rain
  I run my train
  Wherever the track is laid,
  And over the road
  I carry a load
  Whenever the freight is paid.

  A kaddy of tea
  For Genessee,
  For Troy an empty crate,
  A man in brown
  For Uniontown
  To help them celebrate.




  NO ONE AT HOME


  No one at home in the hen-house,
  And no one at home in the barn,
  Old Brindle has gone to the neighbor's
  To borrow a skein of brown yarn,
  To borrow yarn for the darning
  Of socks for her wee spotted calf--

  The little rollicking rascal
  Has never enough by half.
  And Speckle is down by the willow
  Washing her chicks in the lake,
  While old Daddy Cockle is lying
  Abed with a bad toothache.




  PATTERS AND TATTERS


  Patters had a gallant band,
  An army made of clay.
  But Tatters took the garden hose
  And washed them all away.

  CROWN THE KING WITH CARROT TOPS


  Crown the king with carrot tops,
  Dress him in sateen,
  Give him lots of licorice drops,
  With suckers in between.

  For he's a king with lots of power
  And awful, awful fierce,
  He kills a pirate every hour
  And washes in his tears.

  He rides a charger ten feet high,
  A dashing, dappled gray;
  Has ginger pop and lemon pie
  For breakfast every day.

  So get a royal canopy,
  The finest ever seen,
  And whiskers for his majesty,
  And tresses for the queen.




  THE CANADA GOOSE


  A Canada goose
  On the South Palouse
  Is singing her summer song.
  Her words are wise,
  And she greets the skies
  With a voice like a steamer gong:
  "If you harbor your wealth
  And keep your health,
  You'll always be rich and strong."

  HIPPERTY, CLICKERTY, CLACKERTY, BANG


  Hipperty, clickerty, clackerty, bang,
  Get in a corner as fast as you can!
  The sideboard is tipsy, the table is mad,
  The chairs have lost all the sense that they had.
  So hipperty, clickerty, clackerty, bang,
  Get in a corner as fast as you can!

  SONNY


  A sailor gave his sonny
  Nearly half a pint of money
  And sent him out to buy a ton of coal;
  But he met a poor old miser
  Who told him it were wiser
  To bury all his money in a hole.

  A sailor gave his sonny
  Nearly half a pint of money
  And told him he should buy a suit of clothes;
  But he saw a pretty maiden
  With all kinds of posies laden,
  And he gave her all his money for a rose.

  Then the sailor gave his sonny
  Nearly half a pint of money
  To buy a little garden and a house;
  But he found him the next day,
  In a shop on Yesler Way,
  A-buying cheese and crackers for a mouse.

  THE STOVE


  A stove is a thing that gets awfully hot,
  And fries up your meat, or whatever you've got.
  It's made out of iron and hinges and screws,
  And filled up with shakers, and dampers, and flues.
  It's not very long and it's not very wide;
  It's got black'ning on top and ashes inside.

  THE THUNDER BABY


  Have you heard of the Thunder Baby
  Way up in the big blue sky?
  You've seen his cradle, maybe,
  And maybe you've heard him cry.

  Most of the time he's sleeping,
  Rolled up in a big white cloud,
  But when he's awake and hungry
  He bellows awfully loud.

  And when he's crying, sometimes
  You can hear his teardrops fall
  With a patter, patter, patter,
  Against the garden wall.

  But when he's madder'n mischief,
  He rolls, and growls, and spits,
  And kicks the clouds all forty ways,
  And gives the weather fits.

  Then tears come down in bucketfuls,
  And children dance for joy,
  Till the sun comes out and soundly spanks
  Her Thunder Baby Boy.

  HINKY, PINKY, PEARLY EARL


  Hinky, pinky, pearly earl,
  Twenty nobles and a churl;
  Some are fat and some are lean,
  One in red and one in green--
  Prior, priest, and pearly earl,
  Twenty nobles and a churl.

  TIPSY TOM


  Tipsy Tom, the naughty fellow,
  Dressed his wife in pink and yellow,
  Set her in an apple tree,
  And said: "Now catch a bumblebee."




  JOLLY JINKS


  Jolly Jinks, the sailor man,
  Went to sea in an oyster can.
  But he found the water wet,
  Fishes got into his net,
  So he pulled his boat to shore
  And vowed he'd sail the seas no more.




  TRANSFORMATION


  Auntie Ellen found her poodle--
  Mercy! Goodness sake!--
  Playing with the mully-wumps
  Down along the lake.

  And when she called him tenderly
  He didn't want to come;
  It took her over half an hour
  To get the rascal home.

  She washed him well with shaving-soap,
  Pumice stone and lye,
  She showered him and she scoured him
  And she hung him up to dry.

  And now he sits there quite serene,
  The sweetest poodle ever seen.

  THE THIEF CHASE


  Bricks and bones!
  Sticks and stones!
  I chased a thief through twenty zones.

  I found his hat
  On Ararat,
  And hurried on as quick as scat.

  In a day or two
  I found his shoe
  Where he had sailed for Timbuktu.

  I met the goat
  That ate his coat
  Upon the road to Terre Haute.

  At last all worn
  And quite forlorn
  I chased him up the Matterhorn.




  SOMEBODY


  Somebody give me a peanut,
  Somebody give me a pear;
  I want to go down to the circus
  And feed all the animals there.
