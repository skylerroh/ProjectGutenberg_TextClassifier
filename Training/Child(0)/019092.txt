THE ADVENTURES OF PADDY THE BEAVER

I

PADDY THE BEAVER BEGINS WORK

  Work, work all the night
  While the stars are shining bright;
  Work, work all the day;
  I have got no time to play.


This little rhyme Paddy the Beaver made up as he toiled at building the
dam which was to make the pond he so much desired deep in the Green
Forest. Of course it wasn't quite true, that about working all night and
all day. Nobody could do that, you know, and keep it up. Everybody has
to rest and sleep. Yes, and everybody has to play a little to be at
their best. So it wasn't quite true that Paddy worked all day after
working all night. But it was true that Paddy had no time to play. He
had too much to do. He had had his playtime during the long summer, and
now he had to get ready for the long cold winter.

Now of all the little workers in the Green Forest, on the Green Meadows,
and in the Smiling Pool, none can compare with Paddy the Beaver, not
even his cousin, Jerry Muskrat. Happy Jack Squirrel and Striped Chipmunk
store up food for the long cold months when rough Brother North Wind and
Jack Frost rule, and Jerry Muskrat builds a fine house wherein to keep
warm and comfortable, but all this is as nothing to the work of Paddy
the Beaver.

As I said before, Paddy had had a long playtime through the summer. He
had wandered up and down the Laughing Brook. He had followed it way up
to the place where it started. And all the time he had been studying and
studying to make sure that he wanted to stay in the Green Forest. In the
first place, he had to be sure that there was plenty of the kind of food
that he likes. Then he had to be equally sure that he could make a pond
near where this particular food grew. Last of all, he had to satisfy
himself that if he did make a pond and build a home, he would be
reasonably safe in it. And all these things he had done in his playtime.
Now he was ready to go to work, and when Paddy begins work, he sticks to
it until it is finished. He says that is the only way to succeed, and
you know and I know that he is right.

Now Paddy the Beaver can see at night just as Reddy Fox and Peter
Rabbit and Bobby Coon can, and he likes the night best, because he feels
safest then. But he can see in the daytime too, and when he feels that
he is perfectly safe and no one is watching, he works then too. Of
course the first thing to do was to build a dam across the Laughing
Brook to make the pond he so much needed. He chose a low open place deep
in the Green Forest, around the edge of which grew many young
aspen-trees, the bark of which is his favorite food. Through the middle
of this open place flowed the Laughing Brook. At the lower edge was just
the place for a dam. It would not have to be very long, and when it was
finished and the water was stopped in the Laughing Brook, it would just
have to flow over the low open place and make a pond there. Paddy's eyes
twinkled when he first saw it. It was right then that he made up his
mind to stay in the Green Forest.

So now that he was ready to begin his dam he went up the Laughing
Brook to a place where alders and willows grew, and there he began
work; that work was the cutting of a great number of trees by means
of his big front teeth which were given him for just this purpose.
And as he worked, Paddy was happy, for one can never be truly happy
who does no work.




II

PADDY PLANS A POND


Paddy the Beaver was busy cutting down trees for the dam he had planned
to build. Up in the woods of the North from which he had come to the
Green Forest he had learned all about tree-cutting and dam-building and
canal-digging and house-building. Paddy's father and mother had been
very wise in the ways of the Beaver world, and Paddy had been quick to
learn. So now he knew just what to do and the best way of doing it. You
know a great many people waste time and labor doing things the wrong
way, so that they have to be done over again. They forget to be sure
they are right, and so they go ahead until they find they are wrong,
and all their work goes for nothing.

But Paddy the Beaver isn't this kind. Paddy would never have leaped
into the spring with the steep sides without looking, as Grandfather
Frog did. So now he carefully picked out the trees to cut. He could
not afford to waste time cutting down a tree that wasn't going to be
just what he wanted when it was down. When he was sure that the tree
was right, he looked up at the top to find out whether, when he had
cut it, it would fall clear of other trees. He had learned to do that
when he was quite young and heedless. He remembered just how he had
felt when after working hard, oh, so hard, to cut a big tree, he had
warned all his friends to get out of the way so that they would not be
hurt when it fell, and then it hadn't fallen at all because the top had
caught in another tree. He was so mortified that he didn't get over it
for a long time.
