
  It was one by the village clock,
  When he galloped into Lexington.
  He saw the gilded weathercock
  Swim in the moonlight as he passed,
  And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,
  Gaze at him with a spectral glare,
  As if they already stood aghast
  At the bloody work they would look upon.

  It was two by the village clock,
  When he came to the bridge in Concord town
  He heard the bleating of the flock,
  And the twitter of birds among the trees,
  And felt the breath of the morning breeze
  Blowing over the meadows brown.
  And one was safe and asleep in his bed
  Who at the bridge would be first to fall,
  Who that day would be lying dead,
  Pierced by a British musket-ball.

  You know the rest. In the books you have read.
  How the British Regulars fired and fled,--
  How the farmers gave them ball for ball,
  From behind each fence and farm-yard wall,
  Chasing the red-coats down the lane,
  Then crossing the fields to emerge again
  Under the trees at the turn of the road,
  And only pausing to fire and load.

  So through the night rode Paul Revere;
  And so through the night went his cry of alarm
  To every Middlesex village and farm,--
  A cry of defiance and not of fear,
  A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
  And a word that shall echo forevermore!
  For, borne on the night-wind of the Past
  Through all our history, to the last,
  In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
  The people will waken and listen to hear
  The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed
  And the midnight message of Paul Revere.




[Illustration: THE BUILDING OF THE LONG SERPENT
      "Men shall hear of Thorberg Skafting
        For a hundred year!" ]



  THE BUILDING OF THE LONG SERPENT


  Thorberg Skafting, master-builder,
    In his ship-yard by the sea,
  Whistling, said, "It would bewilder
  Any man but Thorberg Skafting,
    Any man but me!"

  Near him lay the Dragon stranded,
    Built of old by Raud the Strong,
  And King Olaf had commanded
  He should build another Dragon,
    Twice as large and long.

  Therefore whistled Thorberg Skafting,
    As he sat with half-closed eyes,
  And his head turned sideways, drafting
  That new vessel for King Olaf
    Twice the Dragon's size.

  Round him busily hewed and hammered
    Mallet huge and heavy axe;
  Workmen laughed and sang and clamored;
  Whirred the wheels, that into rigging
    Spun the shining flax!

  All this tumult heard the master,--
    It was music to his ear;
  Fancy whispered all the faster,
  "Men shall hear of Thorberg Skafting
    For a hundred year!"

  Workmen sweating at the forges
    Fashioned iron bolt and bar,
  Like a warlock's midnight orgies
  Smoked and bubbled the black caldron
    With the boiling tar.

  Did the warlocks mingle in it,
    Thorberg Skafting, any curse?
  Could you not be gone a minute
  But some mischief must be doing,
    Turning bad to worse?

  'T was an ill wind that came wafting
    From his homestead words of woe;
  To his farm went Thorberg Skafting,
  Oft repeating to his workmen,
    Build ye thus and so.

  After long delays returning
    Came the master back by night;
  To his ship-yard longing, yearning,
  Hurried he, and did not leave it
    Till the morning's light.

  "Come and see my ship, my darling!"
    On the morrow said the King;
  "Finished now from keel to carling;
  Never yet was seen in Norway
    Such a wondrous thing!"

  In the ship-yard, idly talking,
    At the ship the workmen stared:
  Some one, all their labor balking,
  Down her sides had cut deep gashes,
    Not a plank was spared!

  "Death be to the evil-doer!"
    With an oath King Olaf spoke!
  "But rewards to his pursuer!"
  And with wrath his face grew redder
    Than his scarlet cloak.

  Straight the master-builder, smiling,
    Answered thus the angry King:
  "Cease blaspheming and reviling,
  Olaf, it was Thorberg Skafting
    Who has done this thing!"

  Then he chipped and smoothed the planking,
    Till the King, delighted, swore,
  With much lauding and much thanking,
  "Handsomer is now my Dragon
    Than she was before!"

  Seventy ells and four extended
    On the grass the vessel's keel;
  High above it, gilt and splendid,
  Rose the figure-head ferocious
    With its crest of steel.

  Then they launched her from the tressels,
    In the ship-yard by the sea;
  She was the grandest of all vessels,
  Never ship was built in Norway
    Half so fine as she!

  The Long Serpent was she christened,
    'Mid the roar of cheer on cheer!
  They who to the Saga listened
  Heard the name of Thorberg Skafting
    For a hundred year!
