                         TERMS TO BE DEFINED.

An ELEMENTARY SOUND is the simplest sound of spoken language.

There are forty-four elementary sounds in the English language. As
there are only twenty-six letters in the alphabet some letters
represent more than one sound. Certain marks or distinguishing
characters used with the letters to indicate the various sounds are
called DIACRITICAL MARKS.

PHONOTYPY is a method of representing each of the elementary sounds by
a distinct printed character or letter.

The VOCALS or TONICS are those elementary sounds made by an unmodified
or uninterrupted tone of the voice; as [=a], [)e].

The SUBVOCALS or SUBTONICS are those elementary sounds made by the
tone of the voice modified by the organs of speech, making an
undertone; as b, d, g, r.

The ASPIRATES or ATONICS are those elementary sounds made by merely
breathing modified by the organs of speech; sometimes called breath
sounds; as p, t, s.
