    My life is a bore in this nasty pond,
    And I long to go out in the world beyond!

[Illustration]

    I wish I could hop like you!"
    Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.

[Illustration]

    "Please give me a ride on your back!"
        Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.

    "I would sit quite still, and say nothing but 'Quack,'
        The whole of the long day through!

[Illustration]

    And we'd go to the Dee, and the Jelly Bo Lee,
    Over the land, and over the sea;--
        Please take me a ride! O do!"
        Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.

    Said the Kangaroo to the Duck,
        "This requires some little reflection;
    Perhaps on the whole it might bring me luck,
        And there seems but one objection,

[Illustration]

    Which is, if you'll let me speak so bold,
    Your feet are unpleasantly wet and cold,
        And would probably give me the roo-
        Matiz." said the Kangaroo.

[Illustration]

    Said the Duck, "As I sate on the rocks,
        I have thought over that completely,
    And I bought four pairs of worsted socks
        Which fit my web-feet neatly

[Illustration]

    And to keep out the cold I've bought a cloak
    And every day a cigar I'll smoke,
        All to follow my own dear true
        Love of a Kangaroo!"

    Said the Kangaroo, "I'm ready!
        All in the moonlight pale;
    But to balance me well, dear Duck, sit steady!
        And quite at the end of my tail!"

    So away they went with a hop and a bound,
    And they hopped the whole world three times round;
        And who so happy,--O who,
        As the Duck and the Kangaroo?
