PREFACE


The following rhythmic plays compiled by Mr. John N. Richards of the
Newark Department of Physical Education have been devised to meet the
needs in the transition of Physical Education activities between the
kindergarten and the first few years of the primary school.

The physiologist tells us that the nervous organism of early childhood
is injured by the strain of strict, immobile attention required in
formal gymnastics. Therefore it is wise to hold the child's interest and
attention by means of dramatized nursery plays. These make little strain
on mental application and the child is able to dramatize in motion the
words and music which are planned to develop his motor co-ordination. In
this way the child is gradually and interestingly led from the freedom
of expression, characteristic of babyhood to the more specialized formal
activities of the third and fourth years in the school.

Mr. Richards' contribution merits widespread usage because he has
clearly and definitely described his rhythm plays so that the classroom
teacher can easily make use of them without having to draw on her
imagination or having to guess at the written explanation.

The book should be useful and welcomed too, not only by the classroom
teacher but also by the specialist and supervisor of Physical Education.

INTRODUCTION


The young people of to-day are most fortunate in their opportunities and
advantages. The home, the school, the shop, social life and play offer
increasing fields for service. The ever increasing number of problems
which must be faced, in this reconstruction period of our nation's life,
demands leaders of broad intellect, clear vision and sound judgment.
Coupled with these qualifications there must be developed a moral
earnestness which will make for better citizenship.

The trend of society movement is undoubtedly toward congested city
life. There is lamentable lack of playgrounds and properly equipped
gymnasiums. The school buildings are crowded to capacity and there is a
rush and hurry of life which challenges the attention of all educators
who are interested in the physical well-being of children.

The priceless assets of our communities are the boys and girls who are
growing into manhood and womanhood. We should spare neither expense nor
energy in fitting them physically, mentally and spiritually for the
great problems which will all too soon be theirs.

Exercise habits and a spirit of fair play must be a part of their
training from the early school days. There is no better way of
inculcating these lessons than through story plays and games during
their first school years.

The material contained in this book is practical. The exercise movements
have been set to music which is popular both in the schools and in the
homes. It is carefully graded and should prove to be of great assistance
to the teachers in the lower grades. It tends to bridge over the gap
between the Kindergarten and the Primary Grade activities.

There is need for a manual of this type in our Physical Training
literature and it is hoped that this material will be used generally
throughout the schools of our country.

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE TEACHING OF THE GYMNASTIC ACTIVITY

1. Teach the words of the rhyme to the class, keeping in mind the
rhythm.

2. If in presenting the action, the movement is based upon certain words
as cues, present by imitation the activity as applied to the words,
_i.e._, Little Jack Horner; Little Miss Muffet, etc.

3. If the movement is based on a time element (rhythm), present the
