covered with fetish objects, and thickly hung with spiders' webs. At
each end was a small but deep alcove with a royal chair, so that the
monarch could always sit on the shady side.

Along each side of the little court ran a sort of verandah, beneath
which was an immense assortment of little idols and fetishes of all
kinds.

From one of the verandahs a door opened into the king's bedroom, which
was about ten feet by eight. It was very dark, being lighted only by a
small window about a foot square, opening into the women's apartments.
At one end was the royal couch, a raised bedstead with curtains, and
upon a ledge by the near side (that is to say the king had to step over
the ledge to get into bed) were a number of pistols and other weapons,
among them an English general's sword, bearing the inscription, "From
Queen Victoria to the King of Ashanti." This sword was presented to the
predecessor of King Coffee. Upon the floor at the end opposite the
bed was a couch upon which the king could sit and talk with his wives
through the little window.

In the women's apartments all sorts of stuffs, some of European, some of
native manufacture, were found scattered about in the wildest confusion.
The terror and horror of the four or five hundred ladies, when they
found that their husband was about to abandon his palace and that
they would have no time to remove their treasured finery, can be well
imagined.

In almost every apartment and yard of the palace were very slightly
raised mounds, some no larger than a plate, others two or even three
feet long. These were whitewashed and presented a strong contrast to
the general red of the ground and lower walls. These patches marked
the places of graves. The whole palace, in fact, appeared to be little
better than a cemetery and a slaughterhouse in one. A guard was placed
over the palace, and here, as elsewhere through the town, looting was
strictly forbidden.

All day the general expected the arrival of the king, who had sent
a messenger to say he would be in early. At two o'clock a tremendous
rainstorm broke over the town, lasting for three hours. In the evening
it became evident that he was again deceiving us, and orders were issued
that the troops, in the morning, should push on another three miles
to the tombs of the kings, where he was said to be staying. Later
on, however, the news came that the king had gone right away into the
interior, and as another storm was coming up it became evident that the
rainy season was setting in in earnest. The determination was therefore
come to, to burn the town and to start for the coast next morning.

All night Major Home with a party of Engineers was at work mining the
palace and preparing it for explosion, while a prize committee were
engaged in selecting and packing everything which they considered worth
taking down to the coast. The news of the change of plan, however, had
not got abroad, and the troops paraded next morning under the belief
that they were about to march still farther up the country. When it
became known that they were bound for the coast there was a general
brightening of faces, and a buzz of satisfaction ran down the ranks.
It was true that it was believed that a large amount of treasure was
collected at the kings' tombs, and the prize money would not have been
unwelcome, still the men felt that their powers were rapidly becoming
exhausted. The hope of a fight with the foe and of the capture of
Coomassie had kept them up upon the march, but now that this had been
done the usual collapse after great exertion followed. Every hour added
to the number of fever stricken men who would have to be carried down to
the coast, and each man, as he saw his comrades fall out from the ranks,
felt that his own turn might come next.

At six o'clock in the morning the advanced guard of the baggage began to
move out of the town. The main body was off by seven. The 42d remained
as rearguard to cover the Engineers and burning party.

Frank stayed behind to see the destruction of the town. A hundred
engineer laborers were supplied with palm leaf torches, and in spite of
the outer coats of thatch being saturated by the tremendous rains, the
flames soon spread. Volumes of black smoke poured up, and soon a huge
pile of smoke resting over the town told the Ashantis of the destruction
of their blood stained capital. The palace was blown up, and when the
Engineers and 42d marched out from the town scarce a house remained
untouched by the flames.

The troops had proceeded but a short distance before they had reason
to congratulate themselves on their retreat before the rains began in
earnest, and to rejoice over the fact that the thunderstorms did not
set in three days earlier than they did. The marsh round the town had
increased a foot in depth, while the next stream, before a rivulet two
feet and a half deep, had now swollen its banks for a hundred and fifty
yards on either side, with over five feet and a half of water in the old
channel.

Across this channel the Engineers had with much difficulty thrown a
tree, over which the white troops passed, while the native carriers had
to wade across. It was laughable to see only the eyes of the taller men
above the water, while the shorter disappeared altogether, nothing being
seen but the boxes they carried. Fortunately the deep part was only
three or four yards wide. Thus the carriers by taking a long breath
on arriving at the edge of the original channel were able to struggle
across.

This caused a terrible delay, and a still greater one occurred at the
Dah. Here the water was more than two feet above the bridge which the
Engineers had made on the passage up. The river was as deep as the
previous one had been, and the carriers therefore waded as before; but
the deep part was wider, so wide, indeed, that it was impossible for
the shorter men to keep under water long enough to carry their burdens
across. The tall men therefore crossed and recrossed with the burdens,
the short men swimming over.

The passage across the bridge too was slow and tedious in the extreme.
Some of the cross planks had been swept away, and each man had to feel
every step of his way over. So tedious was the work that at five in
the afternoon it became evident that it would be impossible for all the
white troops to get across--a process at once slow and dangerous--before
nightfall. The river was still rising, and it was a matter of importance
that none should be left upon the other side at night, as the Ashantis
might, for anything they could tell, be gathering in force in the rear.
Consequently Sir Archibald Alison gave the order for the white troops to
strip and to wade across taking only their helmets and guns. The clothes
were made up in bundles and carried over by natives swimming, while
others took their places below in case any of the men should be carried
off their feet by the stream. All passed over without any accident.

One result, however, was a laughable incident next morning, an incident
which, it may be safely asserted, never before occurred in the British
army. It was quite dark before the last party were over, and the natives
collecting the clothes did not notice those of one of the men who had
undressed at the foot of a tree. Consequently he had to pass the night,
a very wet one, in a blanket, and absolutely paraded with his regiment
in the morning in nothing but a helmet and rifle. The incident caused
immense laughter, and a native swimming across the river found and
brought back his clothes.

As the journeys were necessarily slow and tedious, owing to the quantity
of baggage and sick being carried down, Frank now determined to push
straight down to the coast, and, bidding goodbye to Sir Garnet and the
many friends he had made during the expedition, he took his place for
the first time in the hammock, which with its bearers had accompanied
him from Cape Coast, and started for the sea. There was some risk as far
as the Prah, for straggling bodies of the enemy frequently intercepted
the convoys. Frank, however, met with no obstacle, and in ten days after
leaving the army reached Cape Coast.

Ostik implored his master to take him with him across the sea; but Frank
pointed out to him that he would not be happy long in England, where
the customs were so different from his own, and where in winter he
would feel the cold terribly. Ostik yielded to the arguments, and having
earned enough to purchase for years the small comforts and luxuries dear
to the negro heart, he agreed to start for the Gaboon immediately Frank
left for England.

On his first arrival at Cape Coast he had to his great satisfaction
found that the Houssas who had escaped from Coomassie had succeeded in
reaching the coast in safety, and that having obtained their pay from
the agent they had sailed for their homes.

Three days after Frank's arrival at Cape Coast the mail steamer came
along, and he took passage for England. Very strange indeed did it feel
to him when he set foot in Liverpool. Nearly two years and a half
had elapsed since he had sailed, and he had gone through adventures
sufficient for a lifetime. He was but eighteen years old now, but he had
been so long accustomed to do man's work that he felt far older than
he was. The next day on arriving in town he put up at the Charing Cross
Hotel and then sallied out to see his friends.

He determined to go first of all to visit the porter who had been the
earliest friend he had made in London, and then to drive to Ruthven's,
where he was sure of a hearty welcome. He had written several times,
since it had been possible for him to send letters, to his various
friends, first of all to his sister, and the doctor, to Ruthven, to the
porter, and to the old naturalist. He drove to London Bridge Station,
and there learned that the porter had been for a week absent from duty,
having strained his back in lifting a heavy trunk. He therefore drove
to Ratcliff Highway. The shop was closed, but his knock brought the
naturalist to the door.

"What can I do for you, sir?" he asked civilly.

"Well, in the first place, you can shake me by the hand."

The old man started at the voice.

"Why, 'tis Frank!" he exclaimed, "grown and sunburnt out of all
recollection. My dear boy, I am glad indeed to see you. Come in, come
in; John is inside."

Frank received another hearty greeting, and sat for a couple of hours
chatting over his adventures. He found that had he arrived a fortnight
later he would not have found either of his friends. The porter was in a
week about to be married again to a widow who kept a small shop and was
in comfortable circumstances. The naturalist had sold the business, and
was going down into the country to live with a sister there.

After leaving them Frank drove to the residence of Sir James Ruthven
in Eaton Square. Frank sent in his name and was shown up to the
drawing room. A minute later the door opened with a crash and his old
schoolfellow rushed in.

"My dear, dear, old boy," he said wringing Frank's hand, "I am glad to
see you; but, bless me, how you have changed! How thin you are, and how
black! I should have passed you in the street without knowing you; and
you look years older than I do. But that is no wonder after all you've
gone through. Well, when did you arrive, and where are your things? Why
have you not brought them here?"

Frank said that he had left them at the hotel, as he was going down
early the next morning to Deal. He stayed, however, and dined with
his friend, whose father received him with the greatest cordiality and
kindness.

On leaving the hotel next morning he directed his portmanteau to be sent
in the course of the day to Sir James Ruthven's. He had bought a few
things at Cape Coast, and had obtained a couple of suits of clothes for
immediate use at Liverpool.

On arriving at Deal he found his sister much grown and very well and
happy. She was almost out of her mind with delight at seeing him. He
stayed two or three days with her and then returned to town and took up
his abode in Eaton Square.

"Well, my dear boy, what are you thinking of doing?" Sir James Ruthven
asked next morning at breakfast. "You have had almost enough of travel,
I should think."

"Quite enough, sir," Frank said. "I have made up my mind that I shall be
a doctor. The gold necklace which I showed you, which Ammon Quatia gave
me, weighs over twenty pounds, and as it is of the purest gold it is
worth about a thousand pounds, a sum amply sufficient to keep me and pay
my expenses till I have passed. Besides, Mr. Goodenough has, I believe,
left me something in his will. I sent home one copy to his lawyer and
have brought the other with me. I must call on the firm this morning.
I have also some thirty pounds' weight in gold which was paid me by
the king for the goods he took, but this, of course, belongs to Mr.
Goodenough's estate."

Upon calling upon the firm of lawyers, and sending in his name, he was
at once shown in to the principal.

"I congratulate you on your safe return, sir," the gentleman said.
"You have called, of course, in reference to the will of the late Mr.
Goodenough."

"Yes," Frank replied. "I sent home one copy from Coomassie and have
brought another with me."

"We received the first in due course," the gentleman said, taking the
document Frank held out to him. "You are, of course, acquainted with its
contents."

"No," Frank answered, "beyond the fact that Mr. Goodenough told me he
had left me a legacy."

"Then I have pleasant news to give you," the lawyer said. "Mr.
Goodenough died possessed of about sixty thousand pounds. He left
fifteen thousand each to his only surviving nephew and niece. Fifteen
thousand pounds he has divided among several charitable and scientific
institutions. Fifteen thousand pounds he has left to you."

Frank gave a little cry of surprise.

"The will is an eminently just and satisfactory one," the lawyer said,
"for Mr. Goodenough has had but little intercourse with his relations,
who live in Scotland, and they had no reason to expect to inherit
any portion of his property. They are, therefore, delighted with the
handsome legacy they have received. I may mention that Mr. Goodenough
ordered that in the event of your not living to return to England, five
thousand pounds of the portion which would have come to you was to be
paid to trustees for the use of your sister, the remaining ten thousand
to be added to the sum to be divided among the hospitals."

"This is indeed a surprise," Frank said; "and I shall be obliged, sir,
if you will at once draw out a paper for me to sign settling the five
thousand pounds upon my sister. Whatever may happen then she will be
provided for."

The accession of this snug and most unexpected fortune in no way altered
Frank's views as to his future profession. He worked hard and steadily
and passed with high honors. He spent another three years in hospital
work, and then purchased a partnership in an excellent West End
practice. He is now considered one of the most rising young physicians
of the day. His sister keeps house for him in Harley Street; but it is
doubtful whether she will long continue to do so. The last time Dick
Ruthven was at home on leave he persuaded her that it was her bounden
duty to endeavor to make civilian life bearable to him when he should
attain captain's rank, and, in accordance with his father's wish, retire
from the army, events which are expected to take place in a few months'
time.

Ruthven often laughs and tells Frank that he is a good soldier spoiled,
and that it is a pity a man should settle down as a doctor who had made
his way in life "by sheer pluck."
