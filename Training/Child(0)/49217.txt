the portal, and Lilias was invisible.  His foreboding spirit deemed it
an omen at the time; and so it proved; for the sweet earthly form, by
which the Lily bad been manifested to the world, was found lifeless,
the next morning, in the Temple, with her head resting on her arms,
which were folded upon the slab of dark-veined marble.  The chill
winds of the earth had long since breathed a blight into this
beautiful flower, so that a loving hand had now transplanted it, to
blossom brightly in the garden of Paradise.

But, alas for the Temple of Happiness!  In his unutterable grief, Adam
Forrester had no purpose more at heart than to convert this Temple of
many delightful hopes into a tomb, and bury his dead mistress there.
And to! a wonder!  Digging a grave beneath the Temple's marble floor,
the sexton found no virgin earth, such as was meet to receive the
maiden's dust, but an ancient sepulchre, in which were treasured up
the bones of generations that had died long ago.  Among those forgotten
ancestors was the Lily to be laid.  And when the funeral procession
brought Lilias thither in her coffin, they beheld old Walter Gascoigne
standing beneath the dome of the Temple, with his cloak of pall, and
face of darkest gloom; and wherever that figure might take its stand,
the spot would seem a sepulchre.  He watched the mourners as they
lowered the coffin down.

"And so," said he to Adam Forrester, with the strange smile in which
his insanity was wont to gleam forth, "you have found no better
foundation for your happiness than on a grave!"

But as the Shadow of Affliction spoke, a vision of Hope and Joy had
its birth in Adam's mind, even from the old man's taunting words; for
then he knew what was betokened by the parable in which the Lily and
himself had acted; and the mystery of Life and Death was opened to
him.

"Joy! joy!"  he cried, throwing his arms towards Heaven, "on a grave
be the site of our Temple; and now our happiness is for Eternity!"

With those words, a ray of sunshine broke through the dismal sky, and
glimmered down into the sepulchre; while, at the same moment, the
shape of old Walter Gascoigne stalked drearily away, because his
gloom, symbolic of all earthly sorrow, might no longer abide there,
now that the darkest riddle of humanity was read.
