  The little dog has burnt his tail,
  And he shall be hang'd to-morrow.

  There were three crows sat on a stone,
        Fal la, la la lal de.
  Two flew away, and then there was one,
        Fal la, la la lal de.
  The other crow finding himself alone,
        Fal la, la la lal de.
  He flew away, and then there was none,
        Fal la, la la lal de.




  1. Let us go to the wood, says this pig;
  2. What to do there? says that pig;
  3. To look for my mother, says this pig;
  4. What to do with her? says that pig;
  5. To kiss her and love her, says this pig.

  Cold and raw the north wind doth blow,
    Bleak in the morning early;
  All the hills are cover'd with snow,
    And winter's now come fairly.




  Needles and pins,
  Needles and pins,
  When a man marries
  His trouble begins.

  Cock a doodle doo!
    My dame has lost her shoe;
  Master's broke his fiddling stick,
    And don't know what to do.




  Diddle, diddle, dumpling, my son John
  Went to bed with his breeches on;
  One shoe off, the other shoe on,
  Diddle, diddle, dumpling, my son John.




  Dingty, diddledy, my mammy's maid,
  She stole oranges, I am afraid.
  Some in her pocket, some in her sleeve,
  She stole oranges, I do believe.




  There was a man of our town,
    And he was wondrous wise:
  He jump'd into a bramble-bush,
    And scratch'd out both his eyes;
  And when he saw his eyes were out,
    With all his might and main
  He jump'd into another bush,
    And scratch'd them in again.




  Sing! sing! what shall I sing?
  The cat's run away with the pudding-bag string.

  Snail! snail! come out of your hole,
  Or else I'll beat you as black as a coal.




  Two little blackbirds sat upon a hill,
  One named Jack, the other named Gill;
  Fly away, Jack; fly away, Gill;
  Come again, Jack; come again, Gill.




  If all the world was apple-pie,
    And all the sea was ink,
  And all the trees were bread and cheese,
    What should we have for drink?
  It's enough to make an old man
    Scratch his head and think.




[Illustration]

  There was an old man,
  And he had a calf;
    And that's half:
  He took him out of the stall,
  And put him on the wall;
    And that's all.




  Mary, Mary,
    Quite contrary,
  How does your garden grow?
    Silver bells,
    And cockle-shells,
  And pretty maids all of a row.




  We're all dry with drinking on't,
    We're all dry with drinking on't;
  The piper kiss'd the fiddler's wife,
    And I can't sleep for thinking on't.




  I had a little wife, the prettiest ever seen,
  She wash'd all the dishes and kept the house clean;
  She went to the mill to fetch me some flour,
  She brought it home safe in less than half an hour;
  She baked me my bread, she brew'd me my ale,
  She sat by the fire and told a fine tale.




  Handy-spandy, Jack-a-Dandy
  Loves plum-cake and sugar-candy.
  He bought some at a grocer's shop,
  And pleased, away went, hop, hop, hop.

  Here stands a fist,
    Who set it there?
  A better man than you,
    Touch him if you dare!




  Four-and-twenty tailors
    Went to kill a snail,
  The best man among them
    Durst not touch her tail.
  She put out her horns
    Like a little Kyloe cow:
  Run, tailors, run,
    Or she'll kill you all e'en now.

  Long legs, crooked thighs,
  Little head, and no eyes.
            What's that?




  Great A, little A, bouncing B!
  The cat's in the cupboard, and she can't see.




    The north wind doth blow,
    And we shall have snow,
  And what will poor Robin do then?
          Poor thing!
    He'll sit in a barn,
    And keep himself warm,
  And hide his head under his wing.
          Poor thing!




      When I was a bachelor,
        I lived by myself,
      And all the bread and cheese I got,
        I put upon the shelf.
  The rats and the mice they made such a strife,
  I was forced to go to London to buy me a wife:
  The roads were so bad, and the lanes were so narrow,
  I was forced to bring my wife home in a wheelbarrow.
  The wheelbarrow broke, and my wife had a fall,
  Down came wheelbarrow, wife, and all.

  A little boy and a little girl
    Lived in an alley.
  Said the little boy to the little girl,
    "Shall I? oh, shall I?"
  Said the little girl to the little boy,
    "What will you do?"
  Said the little boy to the little girl,
    "I will kiss you."



  Bless you, bless you, bonnie bee:
  Say, when will your wedding be?
  If it be to-morrow day,
  Take your wings and fly away.



  Taffy was a Welshman,
    Taffy was a thief,
  Taffy came to my house,
    And stole a piece of beef.
  I went to Taffy's house,
    Taffy wasn't at home,
  Taffy came to my house,
    And stole a marrow-bone.
  I went to Taffy's house,
    Taffy was in bed,
  I took the marrow-bone,
    And beat about his head.

  As I was going to sell my eggs,
  I met a man with bandy legs,
  Bandy legs and crooked toes,
  I tripp'd up his heels, and he fell on his nose.



  Tell-tale, tit!
    Your tongue shall be slit,
  And all the dogs in the town
    Shall have a little bit!



    Little Miss Muffet
    Sat on a tuffet,
  Eating of curds and whey;
    There came a little spider,
    Who sat down beside her,
  And frighten'd Miss Muffet away.



  Robin and Richard were two pretty men,
  They lay a-bed till the clock struck ten;
  Then up starts Robin and looks at the sky,
  "Oh! oh! brother Richard, the sun's very high;
  You go before with bottle and bag,
  And I'll follow after on little Jack Nag."



  "Come, let's to bed," says Sleepy-head;
    "Let's stay awhile," says Slow:
  "Put on the pot," says Greedy-sot,
    "We'll sup before we go."



  Robin the Bobbin, the big-bellied Ben,
  He ate more meat than fourscore men;
  He ate a cow, he ate a calf,
  He ate a butcher and a half;
  He ate a church, he ate a steeple,
  He ate the priest and all the people!




[Illustration]

  Tom, Tom, the piper's son,
  Stole a pig and away he ran.
  The pig was eat, and Tom was beat,
  And Tom ran crying down the street.




  Shoe the horse, shoe the colt,
    Shoe the wild mare;
  Here a nail, there a nail,
    Yet she goes bare.
