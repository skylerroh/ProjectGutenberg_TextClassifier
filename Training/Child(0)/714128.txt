"He wept because you wept, he suffered because you suffered," said the
doctor. "Now I understand how he was aroused by these words. With such
impressions in early childhood it is no wonder he became a quiet and
reserved boy. This explains to me much in the past."

Then the lady from Geneva came up for she wanted to talk with the mother.

"My dear, good woman, he certainly must not go up on the mountain again.
He is not fit for it," she said in great eagerness. "We must find
something different for him. Has he no taste for some other occupation?
But it must be light, for he is not strong and needs care."

"Oh, yes, he has a great desire to learn something," said his mother.
"From a little boy he has wished for it, but I hardly dare mention it."

"There, there, my good woman, tell me right away about it," said the lady
encouragingly, expecting something unheard-of.

"He wants so much to be a wood-carver, and has a good deal of talent for
it, but the cost of board and instruction together is more than eighty
francs."

"Is that all?" exclaimed the lady in the greatest surprise, "is that all?
Come, my boy," and she ran to Toni again, "would you really like to
become a wood-carver--better than anything else?"

The joy which shone in Toni's eyes, when he answered that he would, showed
the lady what she had to do. She had such a longing to help Toni, that she
wanted to act immediately that very hour.

"Would you like to learn at once, go to a teacher right away?" she asked
him.

Toni gladly replied that he would.

But now came a new thought. She turned to the doctor. "Perhaps he ought to
recover his health first?"

The doctor replied that he had been already thinking about that. The
mother had told him that she knew a very good master up in Frutigen. "Now
I think," he went on to say, "that carving is not a strenuous work, and
one of the most important things for Toni is to have for some time good,
nourishing food. In Frutigen there is a very good inn, if he only could--"

"I will undertake that, Doctor, I will undertake that," interrupted the
lady. "I will go with him. We will start to-morrow. In Frutigen I will
provide for Toni's board and lodging and for everything he needs." In her
great delight the lady shook hands with both the mother and the boy
repeatedly, and went out to instruct her maid about preparations for the
journey.

When the mother with her boy had been taken to their room, the doctor said
with great delight to his wife:

"We have two recoveries. Our lady is also cured. A new interest has come
to her, and you will see she will have new life in providing for this
young boy. This has been a beautiful day!"

On the following morning the journey was made to Frutigen, and the little
company were so glad and happy together that they reached there before
they were aware of it.

At the wood-carver's the lady was told everything that would be needed for
the work, and after he had showed them all kinds of instruments, he
thought a fine book with good pictures, from which one could work, would
be useful.

After the lady had charged him to teach Toni everything in any way
necessary for the future, they went to the inn. Here the lady engaged a
good room with comfortable bed, and herself arranged with the host a bill
of fare for every day in the week. The host promised, with many bows, to
follow everything exactly, for he saw very well with whom he had to deal.

Then Toni and his mother had to eat with the lady in the inn, and during
the meal she had much more to say. She was going now, she said, the next
day, home to Geneva, where there were large shops, in which nothing was
sold but carvings. There she would immediately arrange for Toni to send
all his articles, so he could begin to work with fresh zeal. Moreover, she
insisted that Toni should remain, not two, but three months with the
carver, so that he could learn everything from the foundation. He could go
from here to visit his mother on Sundays, or she could come to him.

Elsbeth and Toni were so full of gratitude, they could find no words to
express it, but the lady understood them nevertheless and bore home a
happy heart, such as she had not had for a long time.

It came about just as the doctor had foreseen. The lady, who had not been
able to think any more about her home now desired to return to Geneva. She
had so many plans to carry out there, that she could hardly wait for the
day when she was to go back.

The doctor was delighted to consent to her going soon.

Toni, who had hardly begun with his new teacher, applied himself with so
much zeal and skill to his work, that the carver said to his wife in the
fourth week:

"If he goes on like this, he will learn to do better than I can."

The three months had come to an end, and Christmas was drawing near. One
morning Toni waded through the deep snow up to his home. He looked round
and fresh, and his heart was so happy he had to sing aloud as he came
along.

But when after a long walk, he suddenly saw the stone hut with the
fir-tree thickly covered with snow behind it, tears of joy came to his
eyes. He was coming home, home for all time. He ran to the little house,
and his mother, who had already seen him, hurried out, and which one of
the two was the more delighted, no one could tell; but they were both so
happy, as they sat together again in the cottage, that they could think of
no greater fortune on earth. Their highest wish was fulfilled. Toni was a
wood-carver, and could carry on his work at home with his mother. And with
what blessings besides the dear Lord was still overwhelming them! From
Geneva such good things kept coming to Elsbeth, that she no longer had to
dread anxious days, and with each package came new assurance of the ready
acceptance of Toni's work.

Such a Christmas festival as was celebrated two days later in the stone
hut, neither Elsbeth nor Toni had ever known before, for the candles which
his mother had lighted shone out upon a quantity of things, which Toni had
received to wear, and also a whole set of the most beautiful knives for
carving and a book with pictures, of a size and beauty such as Toni had
never in all his life seen before. His master's book was a mere child's
toy beside it. Elsbeth too was lovingly provided for. The lady from Geneva
had planned everything, and the bright reflection from it fell back
radiantly into her own heart.

The most beautiful deer and huntsman and the wonderful eagles on the rock,
standing in the high show-window in Geneva was carved by Toni, and was
considered by him to be a particularly successful piece, so it went, not
to the dealer in Geneva, but to the lady for whom Toni preserved a
thankful heart all his life long.
