FOREWORD


This series of books aims to serve three distinct purposes: first, to
arouse a greater interest in oral reading; second, to develop an
expressive voice--sadly lacking in the case of most Americans; and
third, to give freedom and grace in the bodily attitudes and movements
which are involved in reading and speaking. The stories given are for
the most part adaptations of favorite tales from folklore,--Andersen,
Grimm, AEsop, and the Arabian Nights having been freely drawn upon.

Children are dramatic by nature. They _are_ for the time the kings, the
fairies, and the heroes that they picture in their imaginations. They
_are_ these characters with such abandon and with such intense pleasure
that the on-looker must believe that nature intended that they should
give play to this dramatic instinct, not so much formally, with all the
trappings of the man-made stage, but spontaneously and naturally, as
they talk and read. If this expressive instinct can be utilized in the
teaching of reading, we shall be able both to add greatly to the child's
enjoyment and to improve the quality of his oral reading. In these days
when so many books are hastily read in school, there is a tendency to
sacrifice expression to the mechanics and interpretation of reading.
Those acquainted with school work know too well the resulting
monotonous, indistinct speech and the self-conscious, listless attitude
which characterize so much of the reading of pupils in grades above the
third. It is believed that these readers will aid in overcoming these
serious faults in reading, which all teachers and parents deplore. The
dramatic appeal of the stories will cause the child to lose himself in
the character he is impersonating and read with a naturalness and
expressiveness unknown to him before, and this improvement will be
evident in all his oral reading, and even in his speech.

The use of the books permits the whole range of expression, from merely
reading the stories effectively, to "acting them out" with as little, or
as much, stage-setting or costuming as a parent or teacher may desire.
The stories are especially designed to be read as a part of the regular
reading work. Many different plans for using the books will suggest
themselves to the teacher. After a preliminary reading of a story during
the study period, the teacher may assign different parts to various
children, she herself reading the stage directions and the other brief
descriptions unclosed in brackets. The italicized explanations in
parentheses are not intended to be read aloud; they will aid in giving
the child the cue as to the way the part should be rendered. After the
story has been read in this way, if thought advisable it can be played
informally and simply, with no attempt at costuming or theatric effects.
It will often add to the interest of the play to have some of the
children represent certain of the inanimate objects of the scene, as the
forest, the town gate, a door, etc. Occasionally, for the "open day," or
as a special exercise, a favorite play may be given by the children with
the simplest kind of costuming and stage-setting. These can well be made
in the school as a part of the manual training and sewing work. In
giving the play, it will generally be better not to have pupils memorize
the exact words of the book, but to depend upon the impromptu rendering
of their parts. This method will contribute more largely to the training
in English.

The best results will usually be obtained by using this book in the
third grade. In some schools, however, it may profitably be used in the
second grade.

Ah, good friend, such news as I can tell you!
