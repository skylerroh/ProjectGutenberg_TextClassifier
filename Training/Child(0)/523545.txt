    Then Lucy sees in clouds of gold sweet cherry-trees upgrow,
    And bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow;
    She smells all faint the almond-boughs that blow so wild and fair,
    And doves with milky eyes ascend fluttering in the air.

    Clear flow'rs she sees, like tulip buds, go floating by like birds,
    With wavering tips that warbled sweetly strange enchanted words;
    And as with ropes of amethyst the boughs with lamps were hung,
    And clusters of green emeralds like fruit upon them clung.

    'O witches nine, ye dreadful nine, O witches seven and three!
    Whence come these wondrous things that I this Christmas morning see?'
    But straight, as in a clap, when she of Christmas says the word,
    Here is the snow, and there the sun, but never bloom nor bird;

    Nor warbling flame, nor gloaming-rope of amethyst there shows,
    Nor bunches of green emeralds, nor belfry, well, and rose,
    Nor cloud of gold, nor cherry-tree, nor witch in brindled shawl,
    But like a dream which vanishes, so vanished were they all.

    When Lucy sees, and only sees, three crows upon a bough,
    And earthly twigs, and bushes hidden white in driven snow,
    Then 'O!' said Lucy, 'three times three is nine--I plainly see
    Some witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me.'




    THE ENGLISHMAN


    I met a sailor in the woods,
      A silver ring wore he,
    His hair hung black, his eyes shone blue,
      And thus he said to me:--

    'What country, say, of this round earth,
      What shore of what salt sea,
    Be this, my son, I wander in,
      And looks so strange to me?'

    Says I, 'O foreign sailorman,
      In England now you be,
    This is her wood, and this her sky,
      And that her roaring sea.'

    He lifts his voice yet louder,
      'What smell be this,' says he,
    'My nose on the sharp morning air
      Snuffs up so greedily?'

    Says I, 'It is wild roses
      Do smell so winsomely,
    And winy briar too,' says I,
      'That in these thickets be.'

    'And oh!' says he, 'what leetle bird
      Is singing in yon high tree,
    So every shrill and long-drawn note
      Like bubbles breaks in me?'

    Says I, 'It is the mavis
      That perches in the tree,
    And sings so shrill, and sings so sweet,
      When dawn comes up the sea.'

    At which he fell a-musing,
      And fixed his eye on me,
    As one alone 'twixt light and dark
      A spirit thinks to see

    'England!' he whispers soft and harsh,
      'England!' repeated he,
    'And briar, and rose, and mavis,
      A-singing in yon high tree.

    'Ye speak me true, my leetle son,
      So--so, it came to me,
    A-drifting landwards on a spar,
      And grey dawn on the sea.

    'Ay, ay, I could not be mistook;
      I knew them leafy trees,
    I knew that land so witcherie sweet,
      And that old noise of seas.

    'Though here I've sailed a score of years,
      And heard 'em, dream or wake,
    Lap small and hollow 'gainst my cheek,
      On sand and coral break;

    '"Yet now, my leetle son," says I,
      A-drifting on the wave,
    "That land I see so safe and green
      Is England, I believe.

    '"And that there wood is English wood,
      And this here cruel sea,
    The selfsame old blue ocean
      Years gone remembers me,

    "A-sitting with my bread and butter
      Down ahind yon chitterin' mill;
    And this same Marinere"--(that's me),
      "Is that same leetle Will!--

    "That very same wee leetle Will
      Eating his bread and butter there,
    A-looking on the broad blue sea
      Betwixt his yaller hair!"

    'And here be I, my son, throwed up
      Like corpses from the sea,
    Ships, stars, winds, tempests, pirates past,
      Yet leetle Will I be!'

    He said no more, that sailorman,
      But in a reverie
    Stared like the figure of a ship
      With painted eyes to sea.




    THE PHANTOM


    'Upstairs in the large closet, child,
      This side the blue-room door,
    Is an old Bible, bound in leather,
      Standing upon the floor;

    'Go with this taper, bring it me;
      Carry it on your arm;
    It is the book on many a sea
      Hath stilled the waves' alarm.'

    Late the hour, dark the night,
      The house is solitary,
    Feeble is a taper's light
      To light poor Ann to see.

    Her eyes are yet with visions bright
      Of sylph and river, flower and fay,
    Now through a narrow corridor
      She takes her lonely way.

    Vast shadows on the heedless walls
      Gigantic loom, stoop low:
    Each little hasty footfall calls
      Hollowly to and fro.

    In the dim solitude her heart
      Remembers tearlessly
    White winters when her mother was
      Her loving company.

    Now in the dark clear glass she sees
      A taper mocking hers,--
    A phantom face of light blue eyes,
      Reflecting phantom fears.

    Around her loom the vacant rooms,
      Wind the upward stairs,
    She climbs on into a loneliness
      Only her taper shares.

    Her grandmother is deaf with age;
      A garden of moonless trees
    Would answer not though she should cry
      In anguish on her knees.

    So that she scarcely heeds--so fast
      Her pent-up heart doth beat--
    When, faint along the corridor,
      Falleth the sound of feet:--

    Sounds lighter than silk slippers make
      Upon a ballroom floor, when sweet
    Violin and 'cello wake
      Music for twirling feet.

    O! in an old unfriendly house,
      What shapes may not conceal
    Their faces in the open day,
      At night abroad to steal?

    Even her taper seems with fear
      To languish small and blue;
    Far in the woods the winter wind
      Runs whistling through.

    A dreadful cold plucks at each hair,
      Her mouth is stretched to cry,
    But sudden, with a gush of joy,
      It narrows to a sigh.

    It is a wilding child which comes
      Swift through the corridor,
    Singing an old forgotten song,
      This ancient burden bore:--

    'Thorn, thorn, I wis,
    And roses twain,
      A red rose and a white,
    Stoop in the blossom, bee, and kiss
      A lonely child good-night.

    'Swim fish, sing bird,
    And sigh again,
      I that am lost am lone,
    Bee in the blossom never stirred
      Locks hid beneath a stone!'--

    Her eye was of the azure fire
      That hovers in wintry flame;
    Her raiment wild and yellow as furze
      That spouteth out the same;

    And in her hand she bore no flower,
      But on her head a wreath
    Of faded flag-flowers that did yet
      Smell sweetly after death.

    Clear was the light of loveliness
      That lit her face like rain;
    And sad the mouth that uttered
      Her immemorial strain.

        *     *     *     *

    Gloomy with night the corridor
      Is now that she is gone,
    Albeit this solitary child
      No longer seems alone.

    Fast though her taper dwindles down,
      Heavy and thick the tome,
    A beauty beyond fear to dim
      Haunts now her alien home.

    Ghosts in the world malignant, grim,
      Vex many a wood, and glen,
    And house, and pool,--the unquiet ghosts
      Of dead and restless men.

    But in her grannie's house this spirit--
      A child as lone as she--
    Pining for love not found on earth,
      Ann dreams again to see.

    Seated upon her tapestry-stool,
      Her fairy-book laid by,
    She gazes in the fire, knowing
      She hath sweet company.




    THE MILLER AND HIS SON


    A twangling harp for Mary,
      A silvery flute for John,
    And now we'll play the livelong day,
      'The Miller and his Son.'

    'The Miller went a-walking
      All in the forest high,
    He sees three doves a-flitting
      Against the dark blue sky:

    'Says he, "My son, now follow
      These doves so white and free,
    That cry above the forest,
      And surely cry to thee."

    "I go, my dearest Father,
      But O! I sadly fear,
    These doves so white will lead me far,
      But never bring me near."

    'He kisses the Miller,
      He cries, "Awhoop to ye!"
    And straightway through the forest
      Follows the wood-doves three.

    'There came a sound of weeping
      To the Miller in his Mill;
