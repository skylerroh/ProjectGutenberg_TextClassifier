THE BIRD-WOMAN OF THE LEWIS AND CLARK EXPEDITION

A SUPPLEMENTARY READER FOR
FIRST AND SECOND GRADES

BY KATHERINE CHANDLER

Author of
"Habits of California Plants" and "In the Reign of Coyote: Folk-Lore
from the Pacific"

1905


To my friend
GENEVRA SISSON SNEDDEN
whose interest in this little book has encouraged its completion




PREFACE.

Because children invariably ask for "more" of the stories they find
interesting, this little book of continuous narrative has been written.
Every incident is found in the Lewis and Clark Journals, so that the
child's frequent question, "Is it true?" can be answered in the
affirmative.

The vocabulary consists of fewer than 700 words. Over half of these are
found in popular primers. Therefore, the child should have no difficulty
in reading this historical story after completing a first reader.

The illustrations on pages 13, 15, 29, 64, and the last one on page 79,
are redrawn from Catlin's "Letters and Notes on the Manners, Customs,
and Conditions of the North-American Indians."

My acknowledgments are due Miss Lilian Bridgman, of San Francisco, for
help in arranging the vocabulary.

THE BIRD-WOMAN.

The Bird-Woman was an Indian.
She showed the white men the way into the West.
There were no roads to the West then.
That was one hundred years ago.
This Indian woman took the white men across streams.
She took them over hills.
She took them through bushes.
She seemed to find her way as a bird does.
The white men said, "She goes like a bird.
We will call her the Bird-Woman."
Her Indian name was Sacajawea.

WHO THE WHITE MEN WERE.

The white men Sacajawea went with were soldiers.
There were twenty-nine soldiers.
There were two captains.
The name of one captain was Lewis.
The name of the other captain was Clark.
They were American soldiers.

[Illustration: CAPTAIN CLARK.]
[Illustration: CAPTAIN LEWIS.]

They carried the American flag into the West.
No white men knew about that part of the West then.
The captains wished to learn all about the West.
They wished to tell the people in the East about it.
They had been going West a long time before they met Sacajawea.
They had rowed up the Missouri River.
They had come to many little streams.
They did not know what the Indians called these streams.
So they gave them new names for the white men.
