 Five Christmas presents yet on the floor;
 Bobbin took the soldier cap, then there were four.
 Four Christmas presents underneath the tree;
 Bobbet took the writing desk, then there were three.
 Three Christmas presents still in full view;
 Robin took the checker board, then there were two.
 Two Christmas presents, promising fun,
 Bobbles took the picture book, then there was one.
 One Christmas present--and now the list is done;
 Bobbinet took the sled, and then there were none.
 And the same happy child received every toy,
 So many nicknames had one little boy.

 Wee Willie sat a-thinking,
   And he shook his curly head.
 Around him on the nursery floor
   His treasures lay outspread.

 Firecrackers and torpedoes,
   Trumpet and flag and drum,
 Rockets and pinwheels and paper caps,
   For Fourth of July had come.

 "But it makes me sort o' sorry,"
   Wee Willie said with a sigh,
 "To think of those poor little English boys
   Without any Fourth of July."




 A Bicycle built for Two


 There was an ambitious young eel
 Who determined to ride on a wheel;
       But try as he might,
       He couldn't ride right,
 In spite of his ardor and zeal.

 If he sat on the saddle to ride
 His tail only pedalled one side;
       And I'm sure you'll admit
       That an eel _couldn't_ sit
 On a bicycle saddle astride.

 Or if he hung over the top,
 He could go, but he never could stop;
       For of course it is clear
       He had no way to steer,
 And under the wheel he would flop.

 His neighbor, observing the fun,
 Said, "I think that the thing can be done,
       If you'll listen to me,
       You'll quickly agree
 That two heads are better than one.

 "And this is my project, old chap,
 Around our two waists I will wrap
       This beautiful belt
       Of bottle-green felt
 And fasten it firm with a strap."

 [Illustration]

 This done, with a dignified mien
 The two squirmed up on the machine,
       And rode gayly away,
       Or at least, so they say,
 Who witnessed the wonderful scene.

 Dorothy's Opinion


 Mamma has bought a calendar,
   And every single page
 Has pictures on of little girls
   'Most just about my age.

 And when she bought it yesterday,
   Down at the big bazaar,
 She said, "What lovely little girls,
   How true to life they are."

 But I don't think they're true to life,
   And I'll just tell you why;
 They never have a rumpled frock
   Or ribbon bow awry.

 And though they play with cats and dogs,
   And rabbits and white mice,
 And sail their boats and fly their kites,
   They always look so nice.

 And I am sure no little girl
   That ever _I_ have seen,
 Could play with dogs or sail a boat
   And keep her frock so clean.

 The Roll of Roly Poly Roy


 [Illustration]

 Once on a time a lad I knew--
   His sister called him Bubby;
 His cheeks were red, his eyes were blue,
   And he was plump and chubby.
 Indeed, he was so stout a boy,
 Some called him Roly Poly Roy;
     They called him that
     For he was fat
 And very plump and chubby.

 [Illustration]

 He caused his father grief profound,
   And made his mother worry,
 Because he'd roll along the ground
   When he was in a hurry.
 For as he couldn't see his toes,
 He often tumbled on his nose;
     So, on the whole,
     'Twas best to roll
 When he was in a hurry.

 "Get up!" the people urged, but he
   Replied, "There's no use talking;
 I roll around because, you see,
   It's easier than walking."
 And though it looked extremely droll
 To see the lad lie down and roll,
     It was, forsooth,
     For that fat youth
 Far easier than walking.

 [Illustration]

 One day he thought he'd try to ride;
   Alas, he was so bulky,
 He tumbled off the other side,
   Which made him rather sulky.
 He heard his comrades jeer and scoff,
 Again he tried and tumbled off,
     And when he fell
     They'd shout and yell--
   Of course it made him sulky.

 Just out of town there was a place
   With rolling ground and hilly,
 And here Roy started for a race
   With Dick and Tom and Willy.
 You'll know of course before you're told
 That Roy just laid him down and rolled;
     And so, you see,
     He easily
   Beat Dick and Tom and Willy.

 That day two giants came along
   From Huncamunca Valley,
 Seeking some tenpins good and strong
   For their new bowling alley.
 They reached the hilly sort of place
 Just as our hero won the race;
     "Look at him roll!"
     They said. "He'll bowl
   On our new bowling alley.

 "The other boys are squarely built;
   For tenpins they'll do finely!
 No matter if a few get kilt,"
   And then they smiled benignly.
 Quickly they kidnapped ten small boys,
 All howling with a fearful noise;
     They took them all,
     And Roy for ball,
   And then they smiled benignly.

 [Illustration]

 They hurried to their home and then
   Began their barbarous bowling.
 They set in rows the children ten
   And then set Roy a-rolling.
 But as the giants were strong and great,
 They shot poor Roy at such a rate,
     And with such might,
     That out of sight
   Poor Roy was set a-rolling.

 [Illustration]

 He rolled and rolled and rolled and rolled,
   But soon, his fears dispelling,
 With happiness he did behold
   He'd safely reached his dwelling.
 Secure and safe from further harms,
 His mother caught him in her arms,
     And said with joy,
     "My darling boy,
  You've safely reached your dwelling."

 Now rolling seems to him to be
   More dangerous than walking.
 And Roly Poly Roy you'll see
   Along the sidewalks stalking.
 He'll always have a certain fear
 That giants may be lurking near,
     And so he'll go
     With motion slow
   Along the sidewalk stalking.

 My Barometer


 [Illustration]

 My little maid with golden hair
   Comes each morning for a kiss;
 And I know the day will be fine and fair
   When Polly looks like this.

 [Illustration]

 Or I know the clouds will frown and lower,
   The skies will be dull and gray,
 And perhaps there'll be a passing shower,
   When Polly looks this way.

 [Illustration]

 But a violent storm of rain or snow
   I can prognosticate,
 For the sign will never fail, I know,
   When this is Polly's pate.




 The Butter Betty Bought


 Betty Botta bought some butter;
 "But," said she, "this butter's bitter!
 If I put it in my batter
 It will make my batter bitter.
 But a bit o' better butter
 Will but make my batter better."
 Then she bought a bit o' butter
 Better than the bitter butter,
 Made her bitter batter better.
 So 'twas better Betty Botta
 Bought a bit o' better butter.

 An old astronomer there was
