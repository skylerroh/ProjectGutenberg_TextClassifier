PREFACE


Nothing so quickly or so certainly reveals the character of our culture
and early associations as our speech. The persistence of habits formed
in youth, especially bad habits of pronunciation, is well known, and the
correction of such faults in adult life is a matter of considerable care
and effort.

This manual has been prepared for practical use in the school-room and
for the use of families and individuals who value a correct
pronunciation of the English language.

Several important features of this manual have justified its
preparation. First, the number of words presented has been limited to
those most frequently mispronounced, thus reducing the book to a
practical working field at small cost. Many of the words in most books
on orthoepy are very rarely mispronounced, and they serve only to cumber
the work. Those who desire an exhaustive reference book should consult
the dictionaries. Second, the plan of exhibiting the weight of
authorities where authorities differ is of great practical value. In
these cases the typography and the arrangement are such as to prevent
confusion. It is certainly desirable to know the weight of authority
that prefers one of two or more authorized pronunciations. A glance at
the page will show at once what company we keep. Third, the drill
columns of unmarked words in the back of the book will be appreciated by
every teacher. The attempt to teach orthoepy without much drill and
practice is of little use. It is not enough to tell pupils how words are
pronounced; they must be drilled by abundant practice in order to fix
the correct pronunciation in the memory. Under the head of "How to Use
the Book" this use of the drill columns is fully illustrated. Fourth, in
case of those words about whose pronunciation there is no difference of
opinion among the authorities the fact is indicated by a star opposite
these words. It is a source of much satisfaction to know that many
words, as _albumen_, _address_, _coadjutor_, _divan_, _horizon_,
_harass_, _idea_, _incisive_, _inquiry_, _leisure_, _opponent_, etc.,
have only one authorized pronunciation, and that all other
pronunciations are without any authority whatever.

There is another class of words concerning whose pronunciation there is
some slight difference of opinion but the weight of authority is
overwhelmingly in favor of some one particular form. The plan of this
book enables the student to see at once the strength or weakness of his
position in regard to the pronunciation of such words, and to choose the
form supported by the best authority. This may be illustrated by such
words as _abdomen_, _acclimate_, _appendicitis_, _candelabrum_, _data_,
_finance_, _ignoramus_, _gratis_, etc.

There are many words in our language about whose pronunciation the best
orthoepists and lexicographers differ greatly. In some cases it is very
difficult to determine what form should be preferred. It is well that we
should know these words and the differences of opinion concerning their
pronunciation in order that we may give due credit to those who may use
a different form of pronunciation from that adopted by ourselves.

"The ultimate standard of pronunciation for the English language is the
usage that prevails among the best-educated portion of the people to
whom the language is vernacular; or, at least, the usage that will be
most generally approved by them."

Campbell's law of the good usage of a word applies with much force to
its pronunciation. This law requires this usage to be, first,
_reputable_, or the practice of intelligent and educated persons;
second, _national_, as opposed to provincial or foreign; third,
_present_, or the usage of the generation in which we live.

As representing the best usage in pronunciation, ten of the best
dictionaries of the English language published in this country and in
England have been selected for reference. The scholarship, labor, and
care displayed in these works entitle them to our highest respect. Many
other authorities have been freely consulted, but the resultant of the
opinions of those named is rarely changed by the consideration of any
others. Many important and obvious considerations justify us in
assigning different values to the authorities quoted. In determining the
preferred form of pronunciation in the following pages due weight has
been given to all these considerations, with the feeling, however, that
in the case of a few words a different form from that indicated might
with equal propriety be preferred and used by others.

In cases where there is a marked difference in the English and the
American usage, and yet nearly an average balance, the preference has
been given to the latter.

The compiler has not presumed to give any weight of authority whatever
to his own views in determining the pronunciation of words, but he has
sought rather to present the views of others who are justly entitled to
our highest respect.

HOW TO USE THE BOOK


Success in teaching this book depends very largely upon frequent short
drills. Daily lessons are far better than one or two lessons a week. The
plan should be to advance slowly and review rapidly. Every pupil should
have a book.

The teacher should first assign a lesson of from ten to twenty words
daily, and go over the lesson with the pupils, pronouncing each word
distinctly and giving such other instruction as may be needed.

In preparing the lesson the pupil should learn and adopt the preferred
pronunciation only, using the other forms for reference and general
information.

In the back of the book will be found a list of all the words given in
this manual arranged in order corresponding to the pages and numbered
accordingly for convenient reference, but the words are without
diacritical marks. This list is intended for use in recitation and
drill.

In conducting the recitation, have the pupils in turn pronounce from
this drill list the words assigned for the lesson. While the pupil who
is reciting is thus engaged, the other members of the class should
follow closely with their eyes the words that are diacritically marked
in the body of the book, in order that the eye memory as well as the ear
memory may be utilized in fixing the desired impressions upon the mind.
Corrections may be made in the usual way. Every recitation should
include a rapid review of from one hundred to two hundred of the words
previously learned. This review is essential.

Written recitations at stated times are desirable. The unmarked words
may be written upon the blackboard, and the pupils may be required to
copy them, placing the accent and diacritical marks in the proper
places. Other methods will readily suggest themselves.

If the pupils are not already familiar with the diacritical marks they
should be thoroughly taught before beginning with the words.
