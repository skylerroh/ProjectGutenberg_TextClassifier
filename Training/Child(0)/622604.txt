delightful images and awakening the gentler emotions, is not
accomplished on a first and rapid perusal, but requires that the words
should be dwelt upon until they become in a certain sense our own, and
are adopted as the utterance of our own minds." The value of reading
poetry aloud is very great. Few school children do it well, and it is
especially difficult for them to avoid reading in a sing-song way with
a decided pause at the end of every line. "Accuracy of diction," says
Ruskin, "means accuracy of sensation, and precision of accent,
precision of feeling." Reading poetry aloud is therefore an
accomplishment worthy of earnest cultivation. "Of equal honor with him
who writes a grand poem is he who reads it grandly," Longfellow has
said, and Emerson, "A good reader summons the mighty dead from their
tombs and makes them speak to us." To sit still and listen
attentively is a polite accomplishment and to reproduce accurately
what one has heard is as practically useful as it is unusual.
