The little girl Princess was simply filled with joy. She picked up
Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg and Gustibus and Peter Piper as if they
had been really a Queen's dolls.

"Oh! the darling dears," she said. "Look at their nice, queer faces
and their funny clothes. Just--just like Grandmamma's dollies'
clothes. Only these poor things do so want new ones. Oh! how I
should like to dress them again just as they used to be dressed,
and have the house all made just as it used to be when it was new."

"That old Racketty-Packetty House," said Cynthia, losing her
breath.

"If it were mine I should make it just like Grandmamma's and I
should love it more than any doll's house I have. I never--never--
never--saw anything as nice and laughing and good natured as these
dolls' faces. They look as if they had been having fun ever since
they were born. Oh! if you were to burn them and their home I--I
could never forgive you!"

"I never--never--will,--your Highness," stammered Cynthia, quite
overwhelmed. Suddenly she started forward.

"Why, there is the lost doll!" she cried out. "There is Lady Patsy.
How did she get into Racketty-Packetty House?"

"Perhaps she went there to see them because they were so poor and
shabby," said the little girl Princess. "Perhaps she likes this
one," and she pointed to Peter Piper. "Do you know when I picked
him up their arms were about each other. Please let her stay with
him. Oh!" she cried out the next instant and jumped a little. "I
felt as if the boy one kicked his leg."

And it was actually true, because Peter Piper could not help it and
he had kicked out his ragged leg for joy. He had to be very careful
not to kick any more when he heard what happened next.

As the Princess liked Racketty-Packetty House so much, Cynthia gave
it to her for a present--and the Princess was really happy--and
before she went away she made a little speech to the whole
Racketty-Packetty family, whom she had set all in a row in the
ragged old, dear old, shabby old drawing-room where they had had so
much fun.

"You are going to come and live with me, funny, good-natured
loves," she said. "And you shall all be dressed beautifully again
and your house shall be mended and papered and painted and made as
lovely as ever it was. And I am going to like you better than all
my other dolls' houses--just as Grandmamma said she liked hers."
And then she was gone.

And every bit of it came true. Racketty-Packetty House was carried
to a splendid Nursery in a Palace, and Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg
and Ridiklis and Gustibus and Peter Piper were made so gorgeous
that if they had not been so nice they would have grown proud. But
they didn't. They only grew jollier and jollier and Peter Piper
married Lady Patsy, and Ridiklis's left leg was mended and she was
painted into a beauty again--but she always remained the useful
one. And the dolls in the other dolls' houses used to make deep
curtsies when a Racketty-Packetty House doll passed them, and Peter
Piper could scarcely stand it because it always made him want to
stand on his head and laugh--and so when they were curtsied at--
because they were related to the Royal Dolls House--they used to
run into their drawing room and fall into fits of giggles and they
could only stop them by all joining hands together in a ring and
dancing round and round and round and kicking up their heels and
laughing until they tumbled down in a heap.

And what do you think of that for a story. And doesn't it prove to
you what a valuable Friend a Fairy is--particularly a Queen one?
