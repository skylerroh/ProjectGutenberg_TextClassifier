THE OLD ENGLISH GARDEN

A FLORAL PHANTASY




[Illustration]

  In an old world garden dreaming,
  Where the flowers had human names,
  Methought, in fantastic seeming,
  They disported as squires and dames.

[Illustration]

  Of old in Rosamond's Bower,
  With it's peacock hedges of yew,
  One could never find the flower
  Unless one was given the clue;
  So take the key of the wicket,
  Who would follow my fancy free,
  By formal knot and clipt thicket,
  And smooth greensward so fair to see

[Illustration]

  And while Time his scythe is whetting,
  Ere the dew from the grass has gone,

[Illustration]

  The Four Seasons' flight forgetting,
  As they dance round the dial stone;

[Illustration]

  With a leaf from an old English book,
  A Jonquil will serve for a pen.

[Illustration]

  Let us note from the green arbour's nook,
  Flowers masking like women and men.

[Illustration]

  FIRST in VENUS'S LOOKING GLASS,
  You may see where LOVE LIES BLEEDING,

[Illustration]

  While PRETTY MAIDS all of them pass
  With careless hearts quite unheeding.

  Next, a knight with his flaming targe
  See the DENT-DE-LION so bold
  With his feathery crest at large,
  On a field of the cloth of gold.

[Illustration]

  Simple honesty shows in vain
