        If I'd as much money as I could tell,
        I never would cry, "Old clothes to sell!
        Old clothes to sell! Old clothes to sell!"
        I never would cry, "Old clothes to sell!"

              If "ifs" and "ands"

        There would be no need for tinkers!

        If wishes were horses,
          Beggars might ride;
        If turnips were watches,
        I'd wear one by my side.

        I had a little pony,
          His name was Dapple-gray,
        I lent him to a lady,
          To ride a mile away;
        She whipped him, she slashed him,
          She rode him through the mire;
        I would not lend my pony now
          For all that lady's hire.



43

        I had a little hobby horse,
          His name was Tommy Gray,
        His head was made of pease straw,
          His body made of hay;
        I saddled him and bridled him,
          And rode him up to town,
        There came a little puff of wind
          And blew him up and down.

        I have a little sister, they call her peep, peep;
        She wades the waters deep, deep, deep;
        She climbs the mountains high, high, high;
        Poor little creature, she has but one eye.

          I'll tell you a story
          Of Jack-a-Nory,
        And now my story's begun.
          I'll tell you another
          About Jack's brother,
        And now my story is done.

        In marble walls as white as milk,
        Lined with a skin as soft as silk;
        Within a fountain crystal clear,
        A golden apple doth appear.
        No doors there are to this stronghold,
        Yet thieves break in and steal the gold.

        1. I went up one pair of stairs.

        1. I went up two pair of stairs.
        2. Just like me.
        1. I went into a room.
        2. Just like me.
        1. I looked out of a window.
        2. Just like me.
        1. And there I saw a monkey.
        2. Just like me.

        Jack and Jill went up the hill,
          To fetch a pail of water;
        Jack fell down, and broke his crown,
          And Jill came tumbling after.

        Jack Sprat could eat no fat,
          His wife could eat no lean;
        And so between them both, you see,
          They licked the platter clean.



51

          Knock at the door,        (_forehead_)
            And peep in,            (_lift eyelids_)

            And walk in.

        These lines, common in similar form to many
        countries, are said by children when they throw
        the beautiful little insect into the air to
        make it take flight.

        Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home,
        Your house is on fire, your children all gone;
        All but one, and her name is Ann,
        And she crept under the pudding-pan.

        Little boy blue, come blow your horn,
        The sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in the corn;
        Where is the boy that looks after the sheep?
        He's under the haycock fast asleep.
        Will you wake him? No, not I;
        For if I do, he'll be sure to cry.

        Little girl, little girl, where have you been?

            Little Jack Horner
            Sat in a corner,
        Eating his Christmas pie.
            He put in his thumb,
            And he pulled out a plum,
        And said, "What a good boy am I!"

              Little Jack Jingle,

        Little Johnny Pringle had a little pig;
        It was very little, so was not very big.
        As it was playing beneath the shed,
        In half a minute poor Piggie was dead.
        So Johnny Pringle he sat down and cried,
        And Betty Pringle she lay down and died.
        This is the history of one, two, and three,
        Johnny Pringle he,
        Betty Pringle she,
        And the Piggie-Wiggie.

          Little Miss Muffet
          Sat on a tuffet,
        Eating of curds and whey;
          There came a great spider,
          And sat down beside her,
        And frightened Miss Muffet away.

        Little Tommy Tucker
        Sings for his supper;
        What shall he eat?
        White bread and butter.

        Without e'er a knife?
        How will he be married

        Lucy Locket lost her pocket,

        Four corners to my bed,

        One to watch, one to pray,
        And two to bear my soul away.

        Mistress Mary, quite contrary,

        Old King Cole
        Was a merry old soul,
        And a merry old soul was he;
        He called for his pipe,
        And he called for his bowl,
        And he called for his fiddlers three.
        Every fiddler, he had a fine fiddle,
        And a very fine fiddle had he;
        Twee tweedle dee, tweedle dee, went the fiddlers.
            Oh, there's one so rare,
            As can compare
        With old King Cole and his fiddlers three!

        Once I saw a little bird
          Come hop, hop, hop;
        So I cried, "Little bird,
          Will you stop, stop, stop?"
        And was going to the window
          To say, "How do you do?"
        But he shook his little tail,
          And far away he flew.



70

        One for the money,
          And two for the show;

        One misty, moisty morning,
          When cloudy was the weather,
        I chanced to meet an old man
          Clothed all in leather,
        He began to compliment,
          And I began to grin,--
        "How do you do," and "How do you do,"
          And "How do you do" again!

        I let her go again.

        One, two,
        Buckle my shoe;
        Three, four,
        Shut the door;
        Five, six,
        Pick up sticks;
        Seven, eight,
        Lay them straight;
        Nine, ten,
        A good fat hen;
        Eleven, twelve,
        Who will delve?
        Thirteen, fourteen,
        Maids a-courting;
        Fifteen, sixteen,
        Maids a-kissing;

        Maids a-waiting;

        Put it in the oven for Tommy and me.

        Pussy sits beside the fire;

        So, so, dear Mistress Pussy,

          Ride, baby, ride!
          Pretty baby shall ride,
        And have a little puppy-dog tied to her side;

        Rock-a-bye, baby,

        When the wind blows
          The cradle will rock;
        When the bough breaks
          The cradle will fall,
        Down will come baby,
          Bough, cradle, and all.



84

        Rock-a-bye, baby, thy cradle is green;
        Father's a nobleman, mother's a queen;
        And Betty's a lady, and wears a gold ring;
        And Johnny's a drummer, and drums for the king.

        Sing a song of sixpence,
          A pocket full of rye;
        Four and twenty blackbirds
          Baked in a pie;
        When the pie was opened,
          The birds began to sing;
        Was not that a dainty dish
          To set before the king?

        The king was in his counting-house
          Counting out his money;
        The queen was in the parlor
          Eating bread and honey;

        The maid was in the garden
          Hanging out the clothes,
        When along came a blackbird,
          And pecked off her nose.

        Jenny was so mad,
          She didn't know what to do;
        She put her finger in her ear,

        Some gave them white bread,
          And some gave them brown,

        The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts,

        The King of Hearts he missed those tarts,

        The Knave of Hearts brought back the tarts,
          And vowed he'd steal no more.

        There was a crooked man, and he went a crooked mile,
        And found a crooked sixpence against a crooked stile:

        There was a little boy went into a barn,

        There was a man and he had naught,
          And robbers came to rob him;
        He crept up to the chimney top,
          And then they thought they had him;
        But he got down on t'other side,
          And then they could not find him:
          He ran fourteen miles in fifteen days,
          And never looked behind him.



98

        There was a man in our town,
          And he was wondrous wise;
        He jumped into a briar bush,
          And scratched out both his eyes:
        And when he saw his eyes were out,
          With all his might and main
        He jumped into another bush,
          And scratched 'em in again.

        There was an old man,
        And he had a calf,
          And that's half;

        And put him on the wall;
          And that's all.

        There was an old woman, and what do you think?
        She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink:
        Victuals and drink were the chief of her diet;
        Yet this little old woman could never keep quiet.

        She went to the baker, to buy her some bread,
        And when she came home, her old husband was dead;
        She went to the clerk to toll the bell,
        And when she came back her old husband was well.



101

        There was an old woman lived under a hill,
        And if she's not gone, she lives there still.
        She put a mouse in a bag and sent it to mill;
        The miller he swore by the point of his knife,
        He never took toll of a mouse in his life.

104

        There was an old woman tossed up in a basket
          Nineteen times as high as the moon;
        Where she was going I couldn't but ask it,
          For in her hand she carried a broom.

        "Old woman, old woman, old woman," quoth I,
          "O whither, O whither, O whither, so high?"
        "To brush the cobwebs off the sky!"
          "Shall I go with thee?" "Aye, by and by."

        There was an old woman who lived in a shoe,
        She had so many children, she didn't know what to do.
        She gave them some broth without any bread,
        Then whipped them all soundly, and put them to bed.

        There was an owl lived in an oak,
          Wisky, wasky, weedle;
        And every word he ever spoke,
          Was fiddle, faddle, feedle.

        A gunner chanced to come that way,
          Wisky, wasky, weedle;
        Says he, "I'll shoot you, silly bird,"
          Fiddle, faddle, feedle.

        This is the way the farmers ride,

        1. This little pig went to market;

                Three blind mice!

        To market, to market, to buy a plum bun.

        Two-legs sat upon three-legs,
        With one-leg in his lap;
        In comes four-legs
        And runs away with one-leg;
        Up jumps two-legs,
        Catches up three-legs,
        Throws it after four-legs,
        And makes him bring one-leg back.

                                (_One-leg is a leg of mutton;
                                two-legs, a man; three-legs,
                                a stool; four-legs, a dog._)

        The following is another good "tongue twister"
        (see No. 77). It is recommended for the little
        lisper, and in former days it was recommended
        as a sure cure for the hiccoughs.

        When a twister a-twisting would twist him a twist,
        For twisting a twist three twists he will twist;
        But if one of the twists untwists from the twist,
        The twist untwisting untwists the twist.

        I am going to see them make the hay."

        Their presence will allow teachers to compare

MILKWEED SEEDS

        When windy is the weather.

          Then put them out in a wink.

        Twink, twink, twink, twink,
          They light their light once more,
        Then twinkety, twinkety, twink, twink,
          They put them out as before.


        Nos. 119-146 are in the main the longer nursery
        favorites and may somewhat loosely be called
        the novels and epics of the nursery as the
        former group may be called the lyrics and short
        stories. All of them are marked by dramatic
        power, a necessary element in all true classics
        for children whether in verse or prose. Nos.
        119 and 120 are two of the favorite jingles
        used in teaching the alphabet. Each letter
        suggests a distinct image. In No. 119 the
        images are all of actions, and connected by the
        direction of these actions upon a single
        object. In No. 120 the images are each complete
        and independent. Here it may be noticed that
        some of the elements of the pictures are
        determined by the exigencies of rhyme, as, for
        instance, what the archer shot at, and what the
        lady had. The originator doubtless expected the
        child to see the relation of cause and
        consequence between Y and Z.

        Where are you going, my pretty maid?
        "I'm going a-milking, sir," she said.
        May I go with you, my pretty maid?
        "You're kindly welcome, sir," she said.

MOLLY AND I

        Molly, my sister, and I fell out,
        And what do you think it was about?
        She loved coffee, and I loved tea,
        And that was the reason we couldn't agree.
        But Molly, my sister, and I made up,
        And now together we can sup,
        For Molly drinks coffee, and I drink tea,
        And we both are happy as happy can be.

I SAW A SHIP

        I saw a ship a-sailing,
          A-sailing on the sea;
        And oh, it was all laden
          With pretty things for thee!

        There were comfits in the cabin,
          And apples in the hold;
        The sails were made of silk,
          And the masts were made of gold!

        The four and twenty sailors,
          That stood between the decks,
        Were four and twenty white mice,
          With chains about their necks.

        The captain was a duck,
          With a packet on his back;
        And when the ship began to move,
          The captain said, "Quack! Quack!"

THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN

        There was an old woman, as I've heard tell,
        She went to market her eggs for to sell;
        She went to market all on a market-day,
        And she fell asleep on the king's highway.

        By came a pedlar whose name was Stout,
        He cut her petticoats all round about;
        He cut her petticoats up to her knees,
        Which made the old woman to shiver and freeze.

        When this little woman first did wake,
        She began to shiver and she began to shake,
        She began to wonder, and she began to cry,
        "Lauk a mercy on me, this is none of I!

        "But if it be I, as I do hope it be,
        I've a little dog at home, and he'll know me;
        If it be I, he'll wag his little tail,
        And if it be not I, he'll loudly bark and wail."

        Home went the little woman all in the dark,
        Up got the little dog, and he began to bark;
        He began to bark, so she began to cry,
        "Lauk a mercy on me, this is none of I!"

LITTLE BO-PEEP

        Little Bo-peep has lost her sheep,
          And can't tell where to find them;
        Leave them alone, and they'll come home,
          And bring their tails behind them.

        Little Bo-peep fell fast asleep,
          And dreamt she heard them bleating;
        But when she awoke, she found it a joke,
          For they were still all fleeting.

        Then up she took her little crook,
          Determined for to find them;
        She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,
          For they'd left their tails behind them.

        It happened one day, as Bo-peep did stray,
          Unto a meadow hard by:
        There she espied their tails side by side,
          All hung on a tree to dry.

        Cock a doodle doo!
        What is my dame to do?
        Till master finds his fiddling stick,
        She'll dance without her shoe.

        Cock a doodle doo!
        My dame has found her shoe,
        And master's found his fiddling stick,

THREE JOVIAL HUNTSMEN

        There were three jovial huntsmen,
          As I have heard them say,
        And they would go a-hunting
          All on a summer's day.

        All the day they hunted,
          And nothing could they find
        But a ship a-sailing,
          A-sailing with the wind.

        One said it was a ship,
          The other he said nay;
        The third said it was a house
          With the chimney blown away.

        And all the night they hunted,
          And nothing could they find,
        But the moon a-gliding,
          A-gliding with the wind.

        One said it was the moon,
          The other he said nay;
        The third said it was a cheese,
          And half o't cut away.

THERE WAS A LITTLE MAN

            There was a little man,
            And he had a little gun,
        And his bullets were made of lead, lead, lead;
            He went to a brook,
            And fired at a duck,
        And shot it through the head, head, head.
            He carried it home
            To his old wife Joan,
        And bade her a fire to make, make, make,
            To roast the little duck,
            He had shot in the brook,
        And he'd go and fetch her the drake, drake, drake.

            The drake was a-swimming,
            With his curly tail;
        The little man made it his mark, mark, mark!
            He let off his gun,
            But he fired too soon,
        And the drake flew away with a quack, quack, quack.

TAFFY

        Taffy was a Welshman;
        Taffy was a thief;
        Taffy came to my house,
        And stole a piece of beef.
        I went to Taffy's house;
        Taffy wasn't home;
        Taffy came to my house,
        And stole a marrow-bone.
        I went to Taffy's house;
        Taffy was in bed;
        I took up the marrow-bone
        And flung it at his head!

SIMPLE SIMON

        Simple Simon met a pieman
          Going to the fair:
        Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
          "Let me taste your ware."

        Says the pieman to Simple Simon,
          "Show me first your penny."
        Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
          "Indeed I haven't any."

        Simple Simon went a fishing
          Just to catch a whale:
        All the water he had got
          Was in his mother's pail.

        Simple Simon went to look
          If plums grew on a thistle;
        He pricked his fingers very much,
          Which made poor Simon whistle.

A FARMER WENT TROTTING

        A farmer went trotting upon his gray mare,
             Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
        With his daughter behind him so rosy and fair,
             Lumpety, lumpety, lump!

        A raven cried "Croak!" and they all tumbled down,
             Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
        The mare broke her knees, and the farmer his crown,
             Lumpety, lumpety, lump!

        The mischievous raven flew laughing away,
             Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
        And vowed he would serve them the same the next day,
             Lumpety, lumpety, lump!

TOM THE PIPER'S SON

        Tom he was a piper's son,
        He learned to play when he was young,
        But all the tunes that he could play,
        Was "Over the hills and far away";
        _Over the hills, and a great way off,_
        _And the wind will blow my top-knot off._

        Now Tom with his pipe made such a noise,
        That he pleased both the girls and boys,
        And they stopped to hear him play,
        "Over the hills and far away."

        Tom with his pipe did play with such skill,
        That those who heard him could never keep still;
        Whenever they heard him they began to dance,
        Even pigs on their hind legs would after him prance.

        As Dolly was milking her cow one day,
        Tom took out his pipe and began to play;
        So Doll and the cow danced "the Cheshire round,"
        Till the pail was broke and the milk ran on the ground.

        He met old dame Trot with a basket of eggs,
        He used his pipes and she used her legs;
        She danced about till the eggs were all broke,
        She began for to fret, but he laughed at the joke.

        He saw a cross fellow was beating an ass,
        Heavy laden with pots, pans, dishes, and glass;
        He took out his pipe and played them a tune,
        And the jackass's load was lightened full soon.

WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY

        When I was a little boy,
          I lived by myself,
        And all the bread and cheese I got,
          I put upon my shelf.

        The rats and the mice,
          They made such a strife,
        I had to go to London
          To buy me a wife.

        The streets were so broad,
          And the lanes were so narrow,
        I had to bring my wife home
          On a wheelbarrow.

        The wheelbarrow broke,
          And my wife had a fall;
        Down tumbled wheelbarrow,
          Little wife and all.

THE BABES IN THE WOOD

        My dear, you must know that a long time ago,
        Two poor little children whose names I don't know,
        Were stolen away on a fine summer's day,
        And left in a wood, as I've heard people say.
          _Poor babes in the wood, poor babes in the wood!_
          _So hard was the fate of the babes in the wood._

        And when it was night, so sad was their plight,
        The sun it went down, and the stars gave no light.
        They sobbed and they sighed, and they bitterly cried,
        And the poor little things they lay down and died.

        And when they were dead, the robins so red,
        Brought strawberry leaves, and over them spread.
        And all the day long, the branches among,
        They sang to them softly, and this was their song:
          _Poor babes in the wood, poor babes in the wood!_
          _So hard was the fate of the babes in the wood._

THE FOX AND HIS WIFE

        The fox and his wife they had a great strife,
        They never ate mustard in all their whole life;
        They ate their meat without fork or knife,
          And loved to be picking a bone, e-oh!

        The fox jumped up on a moonlight night;
        The stars they were shining, and all things bright;
        Oh, ho! said the fox, it's a very fine night
          For me to go through the town, e-oh!

        The fox when he came to yonder stile,
        He lifted his ears and he listened awhile!
        Oh, ho! said the fox, it's but a short mile
          From this unto yonder wee town, e-oh!

        The fox when he came to the farmer's gate,
        Who should he see but the farmer's drake;
        I love you well for your master's sake,
          And long to be picking your bone, e-oh!

        The gray goose she ran round the haystack,
        Oh, ho! said the fox, you are very fat;
        You'll grease my beard and ride on my back
          From this into yonder wee town, e-oh!

        The farmer's wife she jumped out of bed,
        And out of the window she popped her head:
        Oh, husband! oh, husband! the geese are all dead,
          For the fox has been through the town, e-oh!

        The farmer he loaded his pistol with lead,
        And shot the old rogue of a fox through the head;
        Ah, ha! said the farmer, I think you're quite dead;
          And no more you'll trouble the town, e-oh!

FOR WANT OF A NAIL

        For want of a nail, the shoe was lost;
        For want of the shoe, the horse was lost;
        For want of the horse, the rider was lost;
        For want of the rider, the battle was lost;
        For want of the battle, the kingdom was lost;
        And all for the want of a horseshoe nail!

A MAN OF WORDS

        A man of words and not of deeds
        Is like a garden full of weeds;
        And when the weeds begin to grow,
        It's like a garden full of snow;
        And when the snow begins to fall,
        It's like a bird upon the wall;
        And when the bird away does fly,
        It's like an eagle in the sky;
        And when the sky begins to roar,
        It's like a lion at the door;
        And when the door begins to crack,
        It's like a stick across your back;
        And when your back begins to smart,
        It's like a penknife in your heart;
        And when your heart begins to bleed,
        You're dead, and dead, and dead, indeed.

        The first stanza of this jingle was long
        attributed to Longfellow as an impromptu made
        on one of his children. He took occasion to
        deny this, as well as the authorship of the
        almost equally famous "Mr. Finney had a
        turnip." The last two stanzas bear evidence of
        a more sophisticated origin than that of real
        nursery rhymes. Mr. Lucas, in his _Book of
        Verses for Children_, gives two different
        versions of these stanzas.


JEMIMA

        There was a little girl, and she had a little curl,
          Right down the middle of her forehead,
        When she was good, she was very, very good,
          But when she was bad, she was horrid.

        One day she went upstairs, while her parents, unawares,
          In the kitchen down below were occupied with meals,
        And she stood upon her head, on her little truckle-bed,
          And she then began hurraying with her heels.

        Her mother heard the noise, and thought it was the boys,
          A playing at a combat in the attic,
        But when she climbed the stair and saw Jemima there,
          She took and she did whip her most emphatic!

        The following was one of the favorite
        "toy-book" texts of the eighteenth century.
        These little books generally had a crude
        woodcut and one stanza of text on a page. It
        can be seen how easily this story lends itself
        to illustration. Each stanza is a chapter, and
        the story-teller could continue as long as his
        inventiveness held out. In one edition there
        are these additional lines:

        "Old Mother Hubbard sat down in a chair,
        And danced her dog to a delicate air;
        She went to the garden to buy him a pippin,
        When she came back the dog was a-skipping."


MOTHER HUBBARD AND HER DOG

        Old Mother Hubbard
        Went to the cupboard,
          To get her poor dog a bone;
        But when she came there,
        The cupboard was bare,
          And so the poor dog had none.

        She went to the baker's
          To buy him some bread;
        But when she came back,
          The poor dog was dead.

        She went to the joiner's
          To buy him a coffin;
        But when she came back,
          The poor dog was laughing.

        She took a clean dish,
          To get him some tripe;
        But when she came back
          He was smoking his pipe.

        She went to the fishmonger's
          To buy him some fish;
        And when she came back
          He was licking the dish.

        She went to the ale-house
          To get him some beer;
        But when she came back
          The dog sat in a chair.

        She went to the tavern
          For white wine and red;
        But when she came back
          The dog stood on his head.

        She went to the hatter's
          To buy him a hat;
        But when she came back
          He was feeding the cat.

        She went to the barber's
          To buy him a wig;
        But when she came back
          He was dancing a jig.

        She went to the fruiterer's
          To buy him some fruit;
        But when she came back,
          He was playing the flute.

        She went to the tailor's
          To buy him a coat;
        But when she came back,
          He was riding a goat.

        She went to the cobbler's
          To buy him some shoes;
        But when she came back,
          He was reading the news.

        She went to the seamstress
          To buy him some linen;
        But when she came back,
          The dog was spinning.

        She went to the hosier's
          To buy him some hose;
        But when she came back,
          He was dressed in his clothes.

        The dame made a curtsy,
          The dog made a bow;
        The dame said, "Your servant,"
          The dog said, "Bow, wow."

        This story of a bird courtship and marriage
        with its attendant feast and tragedy, all
        followed by the long dirge of No. 142,
        constitutes one of the longest nursery novels.
        Its opportunities for the illustrator are very
        marked, and a copy illustrated by the children
        themselves would be an addition to the joy of
        any schoolroom.

THE COURTSHIP, MERRY MARRIAGE, AND PICNIC DINNER OF COCK ROBIN AND JENNY
WREN;

TO WHICH IS ADDED

THE DOLEFUL DEATH OF COCK ROBIN

        It was a merry time
          When Jenny Wren was young,
        So neatly as she danced,
          And so sweetly as she sung,
        Robin Redbreast lost his heart:
          He was a gallant bird;
        He doft his hat to Jenny,
          And thus to her he said:--

        "My dearest Jenny Wren,
