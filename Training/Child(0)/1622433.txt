spring, when an event occurred which made me a wanderer on the earth;
which sent me to "SEEK AND FIND" the mother, for whom I longed and
prayed in my loneliness, and which shall be related in another story.

Our rebellion at the Institute had been successful. We had driven the
tyrant from his throne, and seated another person in his place, who
was fit to teach and to rule. Mr. Hardy was, perhaps, more severe than
his predecessor, but he was just and fair. He had no favorites--at
least none who did not win their high place in his esteem by being
faithful and earnest in all things. Certainly he never gave the
students occasion even to think of such a doubtful expedient as
"BREAKING AWAY."

        "There never has been a more interesting writer in the
        field of juvenile literature than Mr. W. T. ADAMS,
        who, under his well-known pseudonym, is known and
        admired by every boy and girl in the country, and by
        thousands who have long since passed the boundaries of
        youth, yet who remember with pleasure the genial,
        interesting pen that did so much to interest,
        instruct, and entertain their younger years. 'The Blue
        and the Gray' is a title that is sufficiently
        indicative of the nature and spirit of the latest
        series, while the name of OLIVER OPTIC is sufficient
        warrant of the absorbing style of narrative. This
        series is as bright and entertaining as any work that
        Mr. ADAMS has yet put forth, and will be as eagerly
        perused as any that has borne his name. It would not
        be fair to the prospective reader to deprive him of
        the zest which comes from the unexpected by entering
        into a synopsis of the story. A word, however, should
        be said in regard to the beauty and appropriateness of
        the binding, which makes it a most attractive
        volume."--_Boston Budget._

        "Though we are not so young as we once were, we
        relished these stories almost as much as the boys and
        girls for whom they were written. They were really
        refreshing, even to us. There is much in them which is
        calculated to inspire a generous, healthy ambition,
        and to make distasteful all reading tending to
        stimulate base desires."--_Fitchburg Reveille._

        "Mr. ADAMS, the celebrated and popular writer,
        familiarly known as OLIVER OPTIC, seems to have
        inexhaustible funds for weaving together the virtues
        of life; and, notwithstanding he has written scores of
        books, the same freshness and novelty run through them
        all. Some people think the sensational element
        predominates. Perhaps it does. But a book for young
        people needs this, and so long as good sentiments are
        inculcated such books ought to be read."

        "This is the latest series of books issued by this
        popular writer, and deals with life on the Great
        Lakes, for which a careful study was made by the
        author in a summer tour of the immense water sources
        of America. The story, which carries the same hero
        through the six books of the series, is always
        entertaining, novel scenes and varied incidents giving
        a constantly changing yet always attractive aspect to
        the narrative. OLIVER OPTIC has written nothing
        better."


=The Yacht Club Series.= By OLIVER OPTIC. In six volumes. Illustrated.

        6. =Ocean Born=; OR, THE CRUISE OF THE CLUBS.

        "The series has this peculiarity, that all of its
        constituent volumes are independent of one another,
        and therefore each story is complete in itself. OLIVER
        OPTIC is, perhaps, the favorite author of the boys and
        girls of this country, and he seems destined to enjoy
        an endless popularity. He deserves his success, for he
        makes very interesting stories, and inculcates none
        but the best sentiments, and the 'Yacht Club' is no
        exception to this rule."--_New Haven Journal and

        "Paul Farringford, the hero of these tales, is, like
        most of this author's heroes, a young man of high
        spirit, and of high aims and correct principles,
        appearing in the different volumes as a farmer, a
        captain, a bookkeeper, a soldier, a sailor, and a
        traveller. In all of them the hero meets with very
        exciting adventures, told in the graphic style for
        which the author is famous."

        for youth, and within one of the best to be found in
        this or any past age. Troops of young people hang over
        his vivid pages; and not one of them ever learned to
        be mean, ignoble, cowardly, selfish, or to yield to
        any vice from anything they ever read from his
        pen."--_Providence Press._

        the other in the navy, in the great Civil War. The
        romantic narratives of the fortunes and exploits of
        the brothers are thrilling in the extreme. Historical
        accuracy in the recital of the great events of that
        period is strictly followed, and the result is, not
        only a library of entertaining volumes, but also the
        best history of the Civil War for young people ever
        written."

        given in this =Boat Builders Series=, and in each book
        a very interesting story is interwoven with the

        in Dory, the hero of 'All Adrift,' and one of the
        characters retained in the subsequent volumes of the

        him, and every boy who makes his acquaintance in 'All
        Adrift' will become his friend."

        captivating style. OLIVER OPTIC will continue to be

        We have seen a highly intellectual and world-weary
        man, a cynic whose heart was somewhat embittered by
        its large experience of human nature, take up one of
        OLIVER OPTIC'S books, and read it at a sitting,
        neglecting his work in yielding to the fascination of
        the pages. When a mature and exceedingly well-informed
        mind, long despoiled of all its freshness, can thus
        find pleasure in a book for boys, no additional words
        of recommendation are needed."--_Sunday Times._

_A Start in Life_: A STORY OF THE GENESEE COUNTRY.

        In this story the author recounts the hardships of a
        young lad in his first endeavor to start out for
        himself. It is a tale that is full of enthusiasm and
        budding hopes.


_Biding His Time._

        "It is full of spirit and adventure, and presents a
        plucky hero who was willing to 'bide his time,' no
        matter how great the expectations that he indulged in
        from his uncle's vast wealth, which he did not in the
        least covet."--_Boston Home Journal._


_The Kelp-Gatherers_: A STORY OF THE MAINE COAST.

        A bright and readable story, with all the hints of
        character and the vicissitudes of human life, in
        depicting which the author is an acknowledged master.


_The Scarlet Tanager_, AND OTHER BIPEDS.

        Every new story which Mr. Trowbridge begins is
        followed through successive chapters by thousands who
        have read and re-read many times his preceding tales.
        One of his greatest charms is his absolute
        truthfulness. He does not depict little saints, or
        incorrigible rascals, but just _boys_.
