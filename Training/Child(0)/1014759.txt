Better to hunt on fields for health unbought
Than fee the doctor for a nauseous draught.
The wise, for cure, on exercise depend;
God never made his work for man to mend.
--Dryden

Examination

A boy should be examined by his family physician before going to camp in
order that he may receive the greatest good from the camp life and be
safeguarded from physical excess. An examination blank like that shown on
the next page is used in many of the large camps. When the boy arrives in
camp the physician or physical director examines the boy. Take his height,
weight, lung capacity, condition of heart, lungs, condition of muscles,
whether hard, medium or soft, and state of digestion. For this purpose you
will need a wet spirometer, measuring rod, stethoscope and platform
scales. A second blank with carbon duplicate, is kept of every boy.

[Illustration: Wisconsin Boys' Camp Physical Examination Record]

Give dates of first examination on arrival and final examination before
departure from camp. The original is given to the boy to take home and the
carbon copy is retained by the camp, filed in alphabetical order. Most
remarkable gains have been made by boys, particularly in lung capacity,
height, and hardening of muscles. The active life of the camp is not
conducive as a rule to great gain in weight.

Each tent leader should be given the important facts of the examinations
of the boys in his tent, so that there may be intelligent cooperation
between the physician, or physical director, the tent leader, and the boy
in securing health efficiency.

Hospital Tent

If a boy is ill (minor aches and pains which are frequently only growing
pains, excepted), isolate him from the camp, so that he may have quiet and
receive careful attention.

[Illustration: Hospital Tent at Camp Couchiching]

A tent, with fly and board floor, known as the "Hospital Tent" or "Red
Cross Tent," should be a part of the camp equipment. There may be no
occasion for its use, but it should be ready for any emergency. The
physician may have his office in this tent. Boys should not be "coddled;"
at the same time it must not be forgotten that good, sympathetic attention
and nursing are two-thirds responsible for speedy recovery from most ills.

Equipment

A spring cot, mattress, pillow, blankets, a good medicine cabinet, alcohol
stove for boiling water, cooking food, and sterilizing instruments; pans,
white enameled slop jar, pitcher, cup, pail; a table, a folding camp
reclining chair (Gold Medal Camp Furniture Company), and a combination
camp cot and litter (Gold Medal Brand) will make up the equipment of the
tent.

The information and suggestions given in this chapter are the accumulation
of many years' experience in boys' camps. The technical information is
vouched for by competent physicians who have examined the manuscript.[1]

[Transcriber's Footnote 1: This chapter was written in 1911. Many
observations and suggestions are obsolete, if not dangerous or illegal.]

Pulse Rate

Every man in charge of a boys' camp should have a knowledge of certain
physiological facts, so as to be able to make a fair diagnosis of pain and
disease. The pulse, taken at the wrist, is a fair index of the condition
of the body. In taking the pulse-beat, do so with the fingers, and not
with the thumb, as the beating of the artery in the thumb may confuse.
Pulse rate is modified with age, rest, exercise, position, excitements,
and elevation. High elevation produces a more rapid pulse. The normal rate
of boys in their teens is about 80 to 84 beats per minute. An increase not
accounted for by one of the above reasons usually means fever, a rise of 6
beats in pulse usually being equivalent to a rise of 1 degree. Often more
important than the rate, however, is the quality of the pulse. Roughly,
the feebler the pulse, the more serious the condition of the individual.
Irregularity in the rate may be a serious sign, and when it is noticed a
doctor should be immediately called. Failure to find the artery should not
necessarily cause uneasiness, as by trying on himself, the director may
see that the taking of the pulse is often a difficult undertaking.

The Tongue

The tongue is a very misleading guide to the patient's condition, and no
definite rule about its appearance can be laid down. Other signs, such as
temperature, general conditions, localization of pain, etc., are more
accurate, and to the total result of such observations the appearance of
the tongue adds little.

Thermometer

The normal temperature of the human body by mouth is about 98.4 degrees.
Variations between 98 degrees and 99 degrees are not necessarily
significant of disease. A reliable clinical thermometer should be used.
Temperature is generally taken in the mouth. Insert the bulb of the
thermometer well under the boy's tongue. Tell him  to close his lips, not
his teeth, and to breathe through his nose. Leave it in the mouth about
three or four minutes. Remove, and, after noting temperature, rinse it in
cold water, dry it with a clean, towel, and shake the mercury down to 95
degrees. It will then be ready for use next time. Never return a
thermometer to its case unwashed.

Pain

Pain is an indication that there is something wrong with the body that
should receive attention. Some boys are more sensitive to pain than
others, particularly boys of a highly strung, delicate, nervous nature.
Most people, however, think too much of their pains. Most pains to which
boys fall heir are due to trouble in the stomach or intestines, or to
fevers. Many pains that boys feel mean very little. They are often due to
a sore or strained muscle or nerve. A hot application or massage will
often bring relief.

Sharply localized pain, except as the result of external injury, is not
common among healthy boys, and, if found, particularly in the well-known
appendix area, and if accompanied by other disquieting signs (temperature,
pulse, etc.), should receive medical attention.

In a general way, any abdominal pain that does not yield in 24 hours to
rest in bed with application of external heat, should call for the advice
of a physician. Any severe attack of vomiting or diarrhea, accompanied by
temperature, and not immediately traceable to some indiscretion in diet,
is cause for study, and if improvement does not soon show itself, a
physician should be called.

Pains in the extremities, particularly joints, if not clearly showing
signs of improvement in two or three days, should also be the object of a
physician's visit, as a fracture near a joint, if not correctly treated
early, may result in permanent deformity.

The camp physician, or director, if he himself assumes the medical
responsibilities, should enforce the rule that all boys who do not have a
daily movement of the bowels see him, and he should always be ready to
receive such cases and give them the necessary treatment.

The drawings by Albert G. Wegener illustrate in a general way what the
trouble is when one feels a distinct, persistent pain.

Among healthy boys, in camp, thoracic pains, other than those due to
muscular strain, are uncommon, but when severe, especially if accompanied
by a rise of temperature (over 99.5 degrees) and not readily succumbing to
rest in bed, should be investigated by a physician.

Typhoid Fever

The epidemic chiefly to be feared in summer camps is typhoid fever, and
boys coming from cities where that disease is prevalent should be
carefully watched. Care in sanitation minimizes the likelihood of such a
disease springing up in the camp. Other infections, such as mumps,
conjunctivitis, etc., should be carefully isolated, and all precautions
taken to prevent their spread.

A fairly common event may be toward evening to find a boy with a headache
and a temperature perhaps of 102 degrees. This will probably be all right
in the morning after a night's rest and perhaps the administration also of
a cathartic.

The Dentist

The importance of a visit to the dentist before coming to camp cannot be
over-estimated. Every one knows the torture of a toothache, and realizes
how unbearable it must be for a boy away from home and among other boys,
sympathetic, of course, but busy having a good time, and with only a few
patent gums to relieve the misery, and the dentist perhaps not available
for two days. Parents cannot have this point too forcibly thrust upon
them, as by even a single visit to a competent dentist all the sufferings
of toothache may usually be prevented.

Surgical Supplies

The following list of surgical supplies will be found necessary. The
quantity must be determined by the size of the camp, and the price by the
firm from whom purchased.
