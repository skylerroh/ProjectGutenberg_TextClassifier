[Transcriber's Note:
The original text used accented characters to indicate pronunciation. This 7 bit version has been produced using the following markup scheme.

The accented character and the symbol representing the accent are surrounded with square brackets. If the symbol is placed in front of the character, the accent goes above the character. If the symbol is placed after the character, the accent goes below the character. If there is more than one character inside the brackets, the accent applies to all of them.

[Illustration: PREFACE]

The authors of this book believe,--

1st.--_That the Word Method is the most natural and practicable,_
because words are representatives of objects, actions, etc., while
letters, or sounds, in the abstract, convey no meaning to the pupil, and
are devoid of interest.

2d.--_That words of ordinary length are as easily learned as short ones,
provided they are familiar to the pupil_. No teacher will doubt the
statement that a pupil will learn the word "mamma'" as easily as "says"
or "eyes."

3d.--_That frequent "Reviews" are essential to the rapid and thorough
advancement of pupils_. By this means the words imperfectly learned
are again brought to their attention and thoroughly memorized. That
these "Reviews" ought to take up the new words in a different order and
arrangement, in order to test the ability of the pupil to recognize them
in any situation. That as soon as the vocabulary is large enough they
should be written in the form of a new exercise, as on pp. 36, 44, 52,
60, and 68 of this book.  4th.--_That thorough and systematic drill in
Spelling is absolutely necessary_. That the "Reading Reviews" should
be so constructed as to contain all the new words used in the lessons
they were intended to review, and no others, so that they can be used
for "Written or Dictation Spelling." That the pronunciation of the words
in the "Spelling Reviews" should be indicated by the diacritical marks
of Webster, so that they can be used for either "Oral Spelling" or
"Phonic Drill."

5th.--_That the "Script" from which the pupil gets his first and most
lasting impressions should be of large size and accurate form_, and
not of the nondescript character usually found in books of this class.
That it should be free from superfluous line and flourish, and yet have
grace and beauty. That it should be adapted for both copying and
reading.

6th.--_That the lessons should be largely "conversational in style,"_
to cultivate flexibility of voice and to break up the dreary monotone so
frequently heard among children.

7th.--_That the lessons of a book of this grade should not average more
than seven "new words."_ That all such words should appear at the
commencement of lessons, and be familiar to the pupil. That this method
secures careful gradation, and is in marked contrast with the old custom
of having from fifteen to twenty-five.

8th.--_That "Outline Drawings" of the objects first presented to pupils
should be made in the presence of the class_, as it stimulates them to
draw, and thus makes easy and profitable the copying of the "Script
Exercises."

9th.--_That the schoolbook of to-day must be beautifully and copiously
illustrated_. That there must be variety as well as excellence, both in
drawing and engraving. That well-known and famous artists must be
secured, such as Harper, Fredericks, Church, Lippincott, Eytinge, White,
Beard, Weldon, Thulstrup, Cary, Moser, Weaver, and Share; and such
engravers as Karst, Wigand, French, Held, Davis, Hellawell, etc.

10th.--_That the exercises must be instructive as well as interesting,_
and that no artificial system of vowel classification ought to interfere
with the free and natural use of words.

11th.--_That a book of this kind should be suited to the wants of graded
and ungraded schools_, there evidently being nothing in the one not
readily adaptable to the other.

12th.--_That every book of this class should contain a collection of
brief extracts from standard literature_ to be committed to memory.

13th.--_That this book is constructed on the above principles_.
