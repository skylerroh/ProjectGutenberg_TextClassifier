When the mother saw the happy faces of her girls and Dino's improved
health, she felt very happy, too. Suddenly, however, the thought would
rise in her: How will it be when these lovely days are over and we
have to start living again in the narrow confines of town and in the
shadow of those coming years?

The holidays were nearing their end, but nobody yet had time to think
of that, for the Director's birthday was drawing near and this was to
be the great feast day for everybody. Mrs. Halm had asked each of the
children to think out some surprise for Mr. Hellmut. For Mux, however,
she wrote a beautiful birthday verse. As the little boy's head was
filled solely with thoughts of the barn and stable, the kitchen and
the goat cart, the plums, the beetles and ants, it took a great deal
of time and trouble to fix the verse in his memory. Nika, needing no
advice, had long ago decided what to do. Every day as soon as the meals
were over, she silently disappeared. Agnes and Cornelli bolted the
door of the music room and let mysterious songs issue from behind it.
Only Dino was still undecided about his task. When he was left alone
with his mother and Mux one day, and all the others were busy with
their preparations, he said: "Tell me what I could do, mother."

"Draw him a picture of the beautiful goat," Mux advised. He knew that
Dino could draw animals well, and to him there was no finer animal in
all the world than the goat.

"What a knowing goat boy you are, Mux," Dino exclaimed. Despite his
refusal to draw the goat, he had nevertheless gotten an idea from his
little brother. "Oh, I'll draw the two brown horses," he called out
joyously. "I'll make one trotting and the other walking. Matthew must
lead them up for me."

So the boy ran happily to the stable, and after that day he and Matthew
had many meetings in secret.

The birthday came at last.

When the Director entered the dining room in the morning, such a
beautiful duet resounded from the next room that he was compelled to
draw nearer. Agnes and Cornelli were both singing a lovely song with
such deep feeling that the Director could hardly speak. When they had
ended, he patted them both on the shoulder with fatherly tenderness
and then passed into the next room. Here Mux approached him and said
his verse faultlessly in a loud, clear voice. On the table the Director
found two beautiful drawings of his brown horses, and his joy over
them was so great that he did not put them down for quite a while. But
finally he saw all at once a large picture resting in the middle of
the table. His house, with the surrounding garden, the luminous meadow
with the view toward the valley and the distant mountains beyond, was
painted in such fresh and absolutely natural colors that Mr. Hellmut
was quite overcome. This was the view he had loved so passionately
from his childhood.

"Cornelli, come here!" the father called. "Just look at this picture!
Don't you have a beautiful home? Do you love your home as much as your
father loves it?"

"Oh yes, Papa, I love it so much!" said Cornelli. "And I have to think
every day that I never knew how beautiful it was before I went away.
But ever since I came home again, I know. Oh, how beautiful it looks
in the picture!"

Agnes had been standing behind Cornelli. Suddenly she exclaimed
passionately: "Oh, Cornelli, if only you didn't have such a beautiful
home!"

"Agnes," the mother said in alarm, "what unseemly words are you saying?"

The Director looked in astonishment at Agnes, whose eyes were flashing
fire while she regarded the painting.

"Have you had a disagreement with Cornelli? Is that the reason why you
don't want her to have such a beautiful home?" he asked with a sly
smile.

Agnes flushed scarlet.

"Oh no, Mr. Hellmut, I did not mean it that way. I have never fought
with Cornelli, and I only fight with Dino because he wants to have
Cornelli all the time. If Cornelli didn't have this beautiful home and
if she were like me and had to give up all her music lessons and had
to earn her living, we could do fine things together. She has such a
beautiful voice that we could hire a harp and could travel into strange
cities and sing before the houses. Later on we could give concerts and
begin a singing school. But I can't do anything alone."

At this outbreak, which no sign from her could check, the mother became
alternately hot and cold from fright. Agnes' eyes still flashed with
passionate excitement like burning coals.

"I approve of the singing school, but especially of sitting down to
breakfast. I hope very much that we have the usual chocolate to drink
to-day, for it is a good old custom for birthdays which should not be
neglected. So a singing school is to be founded," he continued, while
Mux gazed solemnly at the three huge cakes which were placed beside
the three big chocolate pots. "The wandering harp players are a little
too poetical for me, but I like the idea of a school, Agnes. As I,
too, wish to profit from it, I want it to be built on my estate. Lots
of our workmen in the foundry have small children, whose mothers are
busy with the housework and their small babies. So Agnes and Cornelli
are going to found a singing school in Iller-Stream, where all the
children will go, whose mothers have no time for singing. Upon their
arrival the children shall all be given a bowl of milk and a piece of
bread apiece to make their voices fuller. Now we have settled all about
the school. I shall also have my two teachers instructed, so that they
won't ever be out of practice. I have also some work for Nika: she
shall fill my house with lovely pictures from top to bottom. To inspire
her with plenty of new ideas, I am going to send her to her professor
in town for lessons. Dino shall help me keep my two horses in trim by
giving them plenty of exercise, for that will be good for him and them.
I can use Mux by having him trained to become the manager of my estate.
The good beginning he has made in the knowledge of farming under
Matthew's guidance shall be continued while the ground is covered with
green and the trees are bearing fruit. The mother shall stay here for
the protection of you all. So tell me, now, how you like my plan. Shall
it be thus?"

Absolute silence followed. The children hardly dared to realize that
the words they had just heard were true, and the mother was filled
with deep emotion. She could not utter a word, and tears flowed from
her eyes. Could it be possible that her great sorrow and heavy cares
were suddenly lifted from her? Could it really be true?

At that moment Mux said loudly: "Yes, we like it very much!" He had
clearly grasped that it meant for him keeping on doing what he had
enjoyed so much under Matthew's and Esther's care. The Director had
to laugh, and continued: "I must have the reply of the chief, my dear
Mrs. Halm, so please listen to my plan. I shall let you manage the
children in the winter, and you shall arrange whatever they are to
learn, but they must come here in the summer when I can enjoy all the
results of their studies. I shall also enjoy the great advantage of
having you manage my house when you are here. Does that suit everybody,
or am I getting more than my share?"

At last the mother composed herself.

"Oh, Mr. Hellmut, how can I thank you?" she said, offering him her
trembling hand. "I do not know how to express what is in my heart. How
can I be grateful enough for such boundless kindness? You cannot know
what your generosity means to us all."

Even the children had understood that this unheard-of bliss was true.
Nika was the first to run with beaming eyes to the Director and to
seize his hand, but she could find no words to show her gratitude.
Agnes and Dino, too, had run towards the Director, and the latter did
not know how to shake all the hands that were offered to him. Mux, who
could find no access to his benefactor, climbed up on a chair, and
putting his arms about him from behind, screamed a thousand words of
thanks right into the Director's ears. The wild rejoicing became louder
and louder.

"Cornelli," said the father at last, "give thanks to your foster-mother!
She has earned them, for she has brought joy back to our house."

Cornelli did it with a full and willing heart, for she realized what
the children's mother had done for her. Soon afterwards, Dino and
Cornelli ran away for they had had a simultaneous thought. They did
not want to wait another moment before bringing Martha the wonderful
news. Nobody on earth could share their boundless happiness as Martha
would.

Martha's heart overflowed when she heard what had been proposed. Between
freely flowing tears she said again and again: "Oh, Cornelli! Everything
has happened so wonderfully for you. God has ordained it much more
wisely than we could have wished and prayed for. From now on, we shall
leave everything entirely in His hands. We'll do that as long as we
live, won't we, Cornelli?"

Cornelli nodded with understanding; she had not forgotten how she had
complained to Martha, and how Martha had told her to seek God's help.
Martha had assured her that the help would always come, even if it
revealed itself differently from the way she expected. Now it had all
turned out so gloriously, and so much more splendidly than Cornelli
could ever have imagined!

There had never been such rejoicing in the house as Agnes started when
she and Nika had retired to their room in the evening and Cornelli had
come to pay her accustomed little evening visit. She skipped and danced
about the room like a newly freed bird and called out: "Now our troubles
are over and no secret fears can scare us any more. Now we can sing
all we want and can live here with you every summer, Cornelli. Oh, we
are the happiest creatures in all the world, and it has all happened
through you, Cornelli; you wonderful, incomparable Cornelli!"

Agnes, seizing her friend's hand, jumped about with her in the room
at such a rate that Nika had to calm her. The elder sister warned Agnes
that the Director might have to repent of his kindness to them if their
lengthy stay began with such violent noise. One could see, though,
that Nika was willing enough to join the others in their antics.

"The day on which you came to our house, Cornelli," she said, "has
really been more blessed than any other day in the year. So we must
always celebrate it as a great feast day."

Nika had lately been very sweet and friendly to Cornelli, and the
younger girl had been very happy about it. But had never dreamed that
Nika would ever speak to her like this.

When Esther heard that the Halm family was going to remain for the
present and return every year, she said: "Oh, I am glad. That is much
better than if some other people I know had to come back. It is better
for me and for Cornelli, as well as for the whole house."

"Oh, if I could only come again, too!" said Trina, whose face in these
days was always beaming. "Oh, one feels so happy here!"

"That is very true," Esther affirmed. "I do not see why you shouldn't.
You don't need to worry, Trina. If Cornelli and I wish you well, we'll
see that you come here again."

The Director did not like the thought of losing his large new family
so soon, so he said one day to Mrs. Halm: "I am very anxious to prolong
the children's holiday this year till late in the fall. Dino, who is
more in need of his studies than the others, is least able to go back
to town, because he ought to be thoroughly strengthened and made
absolutely well. If it should be necessary for him to study, we have
our good Mr. Maelinger, who can give him lessons." The mother agreed,
for she also was very anxious to have Dino as well as possible, and
she was very grateful to her benefactor for making this possible.

"There is another reason which makes a longer stay necessary," continued
the Director. "As I fully intend to visit you and the children several
times during the winter, I have rented a more comfortable apartment
for you, because I was rather afraid of finding your tower-like dwelling
a little inconvenient for me. The apartment will be ready for you in
the late autumn, and I want you to get all the rest you can before you
move there, for it is sure to involve some additional work for you.
I hope sincerely that you do not resent my step."

"I can only thank you continually," said the mother now. The children
arrived at the same moment, and all further words from her were
swallowed up in their loud and stormy manifestations of joy. Cornelli
had already told them of her father's plan to let them all stay in
Iller-Stream till winter time.

When all the fruit had ripened on the trees and Dino was shaking one
of them and Cornelli another, Matthew looked over from the barn door,
happily rubbing his hands. Right under the tree he saw the other
children, one biting into an apple, the other into a pear.

"It certainly is different now from last year," he said, smiling to
himself. "There is not a rotten plum or a lonesome pear in all the
orchard."

Every evening, when the last songs resounded in the house, there were
some of thanks and praise which rose up to Heaven like a loud rejoicing.

More than once the Director said to his little daughter, when she gave
him her goodnight kiss: "Did not God mean well with us, Cornelli, when
he guided Martha to write such an inviting notice to the paper?"
