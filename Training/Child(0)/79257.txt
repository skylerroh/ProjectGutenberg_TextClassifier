
"Eustace," remarked Mr. Pringle, after some deliberation, "I find it
impossible to express such an opinion of this story as will be likely to
gratify, in the smallest degree, your pride of authorship.  Pray let me
advise you never more to meddle with a classical myth.  Your imagination
is altogether Gothic, and will inevitably Gothicize everything that you
touch.  The effect is like bedaubing a marble statue with paint.  This
giant, now!  How can you have ventured to thrust his huge,
disproportioned mass among the seemly outlines of Grecian fable, the
tendency of which is to reduce even the extravagant within limits, by
its pervading elegance?"

"I described the giant as he appeared to me," replied the student,
rather piqued.  "And, sir, if you would only bring your mind into such a
relation with these fables as is necessary in order to remodel them, you
would see at once that an old Greek had no more exclusive right to them
than a modern Yankee has.  They are the common property of the world,
and of all time.  The ancient poets remodelled them at pleasure, and
held them plastic in their hands; and why should they not be plastic in
my hands, as well?"

Mr. Pringle could not forbear a smile.

"And besides," continued Eustace, "the moment you put any warmth of
heart, any passion or affection, any human or divine morality, into a
classic mould, you make it quite another thing from what it was before.
My own opinion is, that the Greeks, by taking possession of these
legends (which were the immemorial birthright of mankind), and putting
them into shapes of indestructible beauty, indeed, but cold and
heartless, have done all subsequent ages an incalculable injury."

"Which you, doubtless, were born to remedy," said Mr. Pringle, laughing
outright.  "Well, well, go on; but take my advice, and never put any of
your travesties on paper.  And, as your next effort, what if you should
try your hand on some one of the legends of Apollo?"

"Ah, sir, you propose it as an impossibility," observed the student,
after a moment's meditation; "and, to be sure, at first thought, the
idea of a Gothic Apollo strikes one rather ludicrously.  But I will turn
over your suggestion in my mind, and do not quite despair of success."

During the above discussion, the children (who understood not a word of
it) had grown very sleepy, and were now sent off to bed.  Their drowsy
babble was heard, ascending the staircase, while a northwest-wind roared
loudly among the tree-tops of Tanglewood, and played an anthem around
the house.  Eustace Bright went back to the study, and again endeavored
to hammer out some verses, but fell asleep between two of the rhymes.
