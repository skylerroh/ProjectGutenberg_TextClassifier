    To get him some tripe,
  And when she came back
    He was smoking his pipe.

  She went to the ale-house
    To get him some beer,
  And when she came back
    Doggy sat in a chair.

[Illustration]

  She went to the tavern
    For white wine and red,
  And when she came back
    The dog stood on his head.

  She went to the hatter's
    To buy him a hat,
  And when she came back
    He was feeding the cat.

  She went to the barber's
    To buy him a wig,
  And when she came back
    He was dancing a jig.

  She went to the fruiterer's
    To buy him some fruit,
  And when she came back
    He was playing the flute.

  She went to the tailor's
    To buy him a coat,
  And when she came back
    He was riding a goat.




[Illustration]

  She went to the cobbler's
    To buy him some shoes,
  And when she came back
    He was reading the news.

  She went to the sempstress
    To buy him some linen,
  And when she came back
    The dog was a-spinning.

  She went to the hosier's
    To buy him some hose,
  And when she came back
    He was dress'd in his clothes.

  The dame made a curtsey,
    The dog made a bow;
  The dame said, "Your servant,"
    The dog said, "Bow, wow!"




  Simple Simon met a pieman
    Going to the fair:
  Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
    "Let me taste your ware."

  Says the pieman to Simple Simon,
    "Show me first your penny."
  Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
    "Indeed I have not any."

  Simple Simon went to town
    To get a piece of meat;
  He would not buy a calf's head,
    Because it had no feet.

  Simple Simon went a-fishing,
    For to catch a whale:
  All the water he had got
    Was in his mother's pail.

  Simple Simon went to look
    If plums grew on a thistle
  He pricked his fingers very much,
    Which made poor Simon whistle.

  Sing a song of sixpence, a pocket full of rye,
  Four-and-twenty blackbirds baked in a pie.
  When the pie was opened the birds began to sing,
  And was not that a dainty dish to set before the king?

[Illustration]

  The king was in the parlour, counting out his money;

[Illustration]

  The queen was in the pantry, eating bread and honey
  The maid was in the garden, hanging out the clothes;
  There came a little blackbird and peck'd off her nose.

  There was an old woman, as I've heard tell,
  She went to the market her eggs for to sell,
  She went to the market, all on a market day,
  And she fell asleep on the king's highway.

  There came a little pedler, his name it was Stout,
  He cut off her petticoats all round about;
  He cut off her petticoats up to her knees,
  Until her poor knees began for to freeze.

  When the little old woman began to awake,
  She began to shiver, and she began to shake;
  Her knees began to freeze, and she began to cry,
  "Oh lawk! oh mercy on me! this surely can't be I.

  If it be not I, as I suppose it be,
  I have a little dog at home, and he knows me;
  If it be I, he will wag his little tail,
  But if it be not I, he'll bark and he'll rail."

  Up jump'd the little woman, all in the dark,
  Up jump'd the little dog, and he began to bark;
  The dog began to bark, and she began to cry,
  "Oh lawk! oh mercy on me! I see it is not I."

[Illustration]




          There was a little man,
          And he woo'd a little maid,
  And he said, "Little maid, will you wed, wed, wed?
          I have little more to say,
          Than will you, yea or nay,
  For least said is soonest mended-ded, ded."

          The little maid replied,
          Some say a little sighed,
  "But what shall we have for to eat, eat, eat?
          Will the love that you're so rich in
          Make a fire in the kitchen?
  Or the little god of Love turn the spit, spit, spit?"




  I had a little wife, the prettiest ever seen,
  She wash'd all the dishes and kept the house clean
  She went to the mill to fetch me some flour,
  She brought it home safe in less than an hour;
  She baked me my bread, she brew'd me my ale,
  She sat by the fire and told a fine tale.

  Did you not hear of Betty Pringle's pig?
  It was not very little nor yet very big;
  The pig sat down upon a dunghill.
  And there poor piggy he made his will.

  Betty Pringle came to see this pretty pig,
  That was not very little nor yet very big;
  This little piggy it lay down and died,
  And Betty Pringle sat down and cried.

  Then Johnny Pringle buried this very pretty pig,
  That was not very little nor yet very big.
  So here's an end of the song of all three,
  Johnny Pringle, Betty Pringle, and little Piggy.

    The queen of hearts,
    She made some tarts,
  All on a summer's day;
    The knave of hearts
    He stole those tarts,
  And with them ran away:
    The king of hearts
    Call'd for those tarts,
  And beat the knave full sore;
    The knave of hearts
    Brought back those tarts,
  And said he'd ne'er steal more.

[Illustration]

    The king of spades
    He kiss'd the maids,
  Which vex'd the queen full sore;
    The queen of spades
    She beat those maids
  And turn'd them out of door;
    The knave of spades
    Grieved for those jades,
  And did for them implore;
    The queen so gent,
    She did relent,
  And vow'd she'd ne'er strike more.

[Illustration]

    The king of clubs
    He often drubs
  His loving queen and wife;
    The queen of clubs
    Returns him snubs,
  And all is noise and strife:
    The knave of clubs
    Gives winks and rubs,
  And swears he'll take her _part_;
    For when our kings
    Will do such things,
  They should be made to _smart_.

    The diamond king
    I fain would sing,
  And likewise his fair queen,
    But that the knave,
    A haughty slave,
  Must needs step in between.
    "Good diamond king,
    With hempen string
  This haughty knave destroy,
    Then may your queen,
    With mind serene,
  Your royal love enjoy."




  There was a little guinea-pig,
  Who, being little, was not big;
  He always walk'd upon his feet,
  And never fasted when he eat.

  When from a place he ran away,
  He never at that place did stay;
  And while he ran, as I am told,
  He ne'er stood still for young or old.

  He often squeak'd, was sometimes violent,
  And when he squeak'd he ne'er was silent:
  Though ne'er instructed by a cat,
  He knew a mouse was not a rat.

  One day, as I am certified,
  He took a whim and fairly died;
  And, as I'm told by men of sense,
  He never has been living since.




  The king of France, with twenty thousand men,
  March'd up the hill, and then--march'd back again.

  When good King Arthur ruled this land,
    He was a goodly king;
  He stole three pecks of barley-meal,
    To make a bag-pudding.

  A bag-pudding the king did make,
    And stuff'd it well with plums:
  And in it put great lumps of fat,
    As big as my two thumbs.

  The king and queen did eat thereof,
    And noblemen beside;
  And what they could not eat at night,
    The queen next morning fried.




        My dears, do you know
        That a long time ago,
          Two poor little children,
        Whose names I don't know,
  Were stolen away on a fine summer's day,
  And left in a wood, so I've heard people say.

        And when it was night,
        How sad was their plight!
          The sun it went down,
        And the moon gave no light!
  They sobb'd and they sigh'd, and they bitterly cried,
  And the poor little things they lay down and died.

        And when they were dead,
        The Robins so red
          Brought strawberry leaves,
        And over them spread;
            And all the day long,
            They sung them this song,
  "Poor babes in the wood! poor babes in the wood!
  Ah! don't you remember the babes in the wood?"
