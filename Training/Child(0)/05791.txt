CHAPTER I

PETER RABBIT LOSES HIS APPETITE

     Good appetite, you'll always find,
     Depends upon your state of mind.
     --Peter Rabbit.

Peter Rabbit had lost his appetite. Now when Peter Rabbit loses his
appetite, something is very wrong indeed with him. Peter has boasted
that he can eat any time and all the time. In fact, the two things that
Peter thinks most about are his stomach and satisfying his curiosity,
and nearly all of the scrapes that Peter has gotten into have been
because of those two things. So when Peter loses his appetite or his
curiosity, there is surely something the matter with him.

Ever since Old Man Coyote had come to live on the Green Meadows, Peter
had been afraid to go very far from the dear Old Briar-patch where he
makes his home, and where he always feels safe. Now there wasn't any
reason why he should go far from the dear Old Briar-patch. There was
plenty to eat in it and all around it, for sweet clover grew almost up
to the very edge of it, and you know Peter is very fond of sweet clover.
So there was plenty for Peter to eat without running any risk of danger.
With nothing to do but eat and sleep, Peter should have grown fat and
contented. But he didn't.

Now that is just the way with a lot of people. The more they have and
the less they have to worry about, the more discontented they become,
and at last they are positively unhappy. There was little Danny Meadow
Mouse, living out on the Green Meadows; he was happy all the livelong
day, and yet he had no safe castle like the dear Old Briar-patch where
he could always be safe. Every minute of every day Danny had to keep his
eyes wide open and his wits working their very quickest, for any minute
he was likely to be in danger. Old Man Coyote or Reddy Fox or Granny
Fox or Digger the Badger or Mr. Blacksnake was likely to come creeping
through the grass any time, and they are always hungry for a fat Meadow
Mouse. And as if that weren't worry enough, Danny had to watch the sky,
too, for Old Whitetail the Marsh Hawk, or his cousin Redtail, or Blacky
the Crow, each of whom would be glad of a Meadow Mouse dinner. Yet in
spite of all this, Danny was happy and never once lost his appetite.

But Peter Rabbit, with nothing to worry him so long as he stayed in the
Old Briar-patch, couldn't eat and grew more and more unhappy.

"I don't know what's the matter with me. I really don't know what's
the matter with me," said Peter, as he turned up his nose at a patch
of sweet, tender young clover. "I think I'll go and cut some new paths
through the Old Briar-patch."

Now, though he didn't know it, that was the very best thing he could do.
It gave him something to think about. For two or three days he was very
busy cutting new paths, and his appetite came back. But when he had made
all the paths he wanted, and there was nothing else to do, he lost his
appetite again. He just sat still all day long and moped and thought and
thought and thought. The trouble with Peter Rabbit's thinking was that
it was all about himself and how unhappy he was. Of course, the more he
thought about this, the more unhappy he grew.

"If I only had some one to talk to, I'd feel better," said he to
himself. That reminded him of Johnny Chuck and what good times they used
to have together when Johnny lived on the Green Meadows. Then he thought
of how happy Johnny seemed with his little family in his new home in the
Old Orchard, in spite of all the worries his family made him. And right
then Peter found out what was the matter with him.

"I believe I'm just lonesome," said Peter. "Yes, Sir, that's what's the
matter with me.

    "It isn't good to be alone,
     I've often heard my mother say.
     It makes one selfish, grouchy, cross,
     And quite unhappy all the day.
     One needs to think of other folks,
     And not of just one's self alone,
     To find the truest happiness,
     And joy and real content to own.

"Now that I've found out what is the trouble with me, the question is,
what am I going to do about it?"




CHAPTER II

PETER RABBIT PLANS A JOURNEY


It's a long jump that makes no landing.
--Peter Rabbit.

"The trouble with me is that I'm lonesome," repeated Peter Rabbit as he
sat in the dear Old Briar-patch. "Yes, Sir, that's the only thing that's
wrong with me. I'm just tired of myself, and that's why I've lost my
appetite. And now I know what's the matter, what am I going to do about
it? If I were sure, absolutely sure, that Old Man Coyote meant what he
said about our being friends, I'd start out this very minute to call
on all my old friends. My, my, my, it seems an age since I visited the
Smiling Pool and saw Grandfather Frog and Jerry Muskrat and Billy Mink
and Little Joe Otter! Mr. Coyote sounded as if he really meant to leave
me alone, but, but--well, perhaps he did mean it when he saw me sitting
here safe among the brambles, but if I should meet him out in the open,
he might change his mind and--oh, dear, his teeth are terrible long and
sharp!"

Peter sat a little longer, thinking and thinking. Then a bright idea
popped into his head. He kicked up his heels.

"I'll do it," said he. "I'll make a journey! That's what I'll do! I'll
make a journey and see the Great World.

    "By staying here and sitting still
     I'm sure I'll simply grow quite ill.
     A change of scene is what I need
     To be from all my trouble freed."

Of course if Peter had really stopped to think the matter over
thoroughly he would have known that running away from one kind of
trouble is almost sure to lead to other troubles. But Peter is one
of those who does his thinking afterward. Peter is what is called
impulsive. That is, he does things and then thinks about them later, and
often wishes he hadn't done them. So now the minute the idea of making
a journey popped into his head, he made up his mind that he would do it,
and that was all there was to it. You see, Peter never looks ahead. If
he could get rid of the trouble that bothered him now, which, you know,
was nothing but lonesomeness, he wouldn't worry about the troubles he
might get into later.

Now the minute Peter made up his mind to make a journey, he began to
feel better. His lost appetite returned, and the first thing he did was
to eat a good meal of sweet clover.

"Let me see," said he, as he filled his big stomach, "I believe I'll
visit the Old Pasture. It's a long way off and I've never been there,
but I've heard Sammy Jay say that it's a very wonderful place, and I
don't believe it is any more dangerous than the Green Meadows and the
Green Forest, now that Old Man Coyote and Reddy and Granny Fox are all
living here. I'll start tonight when I am sure that Old Man Coyote is
nowhere around, and I won't tell a soul where I am going."

So Peter settled himself and tried to sleep the long day away, but
his mind was so full of the long journey he was going to make that he
couldn't sleep much, and when he did have a nap, he dreamed of wonderful
sights and adventures out in the Great World.

At last he saw jolly, round, red Mr. Sun drop down to his bed behind
the Purple Hills. Old Mother West Wind came hurrying back from her day's
work and gathered her children, the Merry Little Breezes, into her big
bag, and then she, too, started for her home behind the Purple Hills. A
little star came out and winked at Peter, and then way over on the edge
of the Green Forest he heard Old Man Coyote laugh. Peter grinned. That
was what he had been waiting for, since it meant that Old Man Coyote was
so far away that there was nothing to fear from him.

Peter hopped out from the dear, safe Old Briar-patch, looked this way
