
He nodded.

"Leggings too!" and he stuck up one leg at a sudden right angle on to
the bed; a rash proceeding, but the boy has a straight little figure,
and with a hop or two he kept his balance.

"My dear Jack, they are grand. How warm they must keep your legs!"

He shook his beaver hat.

"No. They only tickles. That's what they do."

There was a pause. His Aunt remembered the old peevish ways. She did not
want to encourage him to discard his winter leggings, and was doubtful
what to say. But in a moment more his eyes shone, and his face took that
effulgent expression which some children have when they are resolved
upon being good.

"--_and as I can't shake off the tickle, I have to bear it_," added the
little gentleman.

I call him the little gentleman advisedly. There is no stronger sign of
high breeding in young people, than a cheerful endurance of the rubs of
life. A temper that fits one's fate, a spirit that rises with the
occasion. It is this kind of courage which the Gentlemen of England
have shown from time immemorial, through peace and war, by land and sea,
in every country and climate of the habitable globe. Jack is a child of
that Empire on which the sun never sets, and if he live he is like to
have larger opportunities of bearing discomfort than was afforded by the
woolly worry of his bottle-green leggings. I am in good hopes that he
will not be found wanting.

Some such thoughts, I believe, occurred to his Aunt.

"That's right, Jack. What a man you are!"

[Illustration]

The rosy cheeks became carmine, and Jack flung himself upon his Aunt,
and kissed her with resounding smacks.

A somewhat wrecked appearance which she presented after this boisterous
hug, recalled the headache to his mind, and as he settled the beaver
hat, which had gone astray, he said ruefully,

"Is your headache _very_ bad, Auntie Julie?"

"Rather bad, Jack. _And as I can't shake if off, I have to bear it._"

He went away on tiptoe, and it was only after he had carefully and
gently closed the bedroom door behind him, that he departed by leaps
and bounds to show himself in his bottle-green coat and capes, and
white buttons and leggings to match, and beaver hat to boot, first to
the young Browns, and after that to the General Public.

As an Observer, I may say that it was a sight worth seeing; and as a
Bird of some wisdom, I prophesy well of that boy.


PROVERBS.

Fine feathers make fine birds.

Manners make the man.

Clowns are best in their own company; gentlemen are best everywhere.

Where there's a will there's a way.

All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.

What can't be cured must be endured.

I find the following letters at the Hole in the Tree.

"X LINES, SOUTH CAMP, ALDERSHOT.

"SIR,--You speak with great feeling of that elevated position
(I allude, of course, to the top of the eight-day clock), which
circumstances led you somewhat hastily to decline. It would undoubtedly
have become you, and less cannot be said for such a situation as the
summit of an easel, overlooking the blackboard, in an establishment for
the education of youth. Meanwhile it may interest you to hear of a bird
(not of your wisdom, but with parts, and a respectable appearance) who
secured a somewhat similar seat in adopting that kind of home which you
would not. It was in driving through a wood at some little distance from
the above address that we found a wounded crow, and brought him home to
our hut. He became a member of the family, and received the name of
Slyboots, for reasons with which it is unnecessary to trouble you. He
was made very welcome in the drawing-room, but he preferred the kitchen.
The kitchen is a brick room detached from the wooden hut. It was once,
in fact, an armourer's shop, and has since been converted to a kitchen.
The floor is rudely laid, and the bricks gape here and there. A barrack
fender guards the fire-place, and a barrack poker reposes in the fender.
It is a very ponderous poker of unusual size and the commonest
appearance, but with a massive knob at the upper end which was wont to
project far and high above the hearth. It was to this seat that Slyboots
elevated himself by his own choice, and became the Kitchen Crow. Here he
spent hours watching the cook, and taking tit-bits behind her back. He
ate what he could (more, I fear, than he ought), and hid the rest in
holes and corners. The genial neighbourhood of the oven caused him no
inconvenience. His glossy coat, being already as black as a coal, was
not damaged by a certain grimeyness which is undoubtedly characteristic
of the (late) armourer's shop, of which the chimney is an inveterate
smoker. Companies of his relatives constantly enter the camp by ways
over which the sentries have no control (the Balloon Brigade being not
yet even in the clouds); but Slyboots showed no disposition to join
them. They flaunt and forage in the Lines, they inspect the ashpits and
cookhouses, they wheel and manoeuvre on the parades, but Slyboots sat
serene upon his poker. He had a cookhouse all to himself.... He died. We
must all die; but we need not all die of repletion, which I fear, was
his case. He buried his last meal between two bricks in the kitchen
floor, and covered it very tidily with a bit of newspaper. The poker is
vacant. Sir, I was bred to the sword and not to the pen, but I have a
foolish desire for literary fame. I should be better pleased to be in
print than to be promoted--for that matter one seems as near as the
other--and my wife agrees with me. She is of a literary turn, and has
helped me in the composition of this, but we both fear that the story
having no moral you will not admit it into your Owlhoots. But if your
wisdom could supply this, or your kindness overlook the defect, it would
afford great consolation to a bereaved family to have printed a
biography of the dear deceased. For we were greatly attached to him,
though he preferred the cook. I can at any rate give you my word as a
man of honour that these incidents are true, though, out of soldierly
modesty, I will not trouble you with my name, but with much respect
subscribe myself by that of

"SLYBOOTS."

The gallant officer is too modest. This biography is not only true but
brief, and these are rare merits in a memoir. As to the moral--it is not
far to seek. Dear children, for whom I hoot! avoid greediness. If
Slyboots had eaten tit-bits in moderation, he might be sitting on the
poker to this day. I have great pleasure in making his brief career
public to the satisfaction of his gallant friend, and I should be glad
to hear that the latter had got his step by the same post as his
Owlhoot.

The second letter is much farther from literary excellence than the
first. I fear this little boy plays truant from school as well as taking
apples which do not belong to him. It is high time that he learnt to
spell, and also to observe the difference between _meum_ and _tuum_.
From not being well grounded on these two points, many boys have lost
good situations in life when they grew up to be men.

"deer mister howl,--as you say you see behind your bak i spose its you
told varmer jones of me for theres a tree with a whole in it just behind
the orchurd he wolloped I shameful and I'll have no more of his apples
they be a deal sowerer than yud think though they look so red, but do
you call yourself a childerns friend and tell tails i dont i can tell
you.
