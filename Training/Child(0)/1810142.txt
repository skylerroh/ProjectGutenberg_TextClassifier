this wonderful castle, where I can be so near Aunt Maxa and everybody I
love. I wonder what Salo will say. May I write to him today and let him
know that we shall have a home with you?"

"How do you do, Mr. Castle-Steward,"

Maezli said that moment, thrusting a plump, round hand between Leonore's
and the Baron's. Maezli had actually made use of the first moment her
hand was free.

"Now Kurt can see for himself that you and Mr. Trius are two people;
can't he, Mr. Steward?"

"This certainly must be cleared up," the Baron answered, shaking Maezli's
hand. "We shall prove to them all that Maezli knows what she has seen.
Leonore, I want to meet your friends now. Won't you bring them to me?"

The children were all standing around their mother and Apollonie, who
were clearing up the mystery for them. The mother had barely been able
to check their violent outbreak, but could not quite quench all
enthusiasm. When they heard that Leonore had come to introduce them to
her uncle, they were a little scared, but Leonore understood their
hesitation and declared, "Just come! You have no idea how nice he is."
Pulling Mea with her, she compelled the others to follow, and arriving at
her uncle's side, she immediately began, "This is Bruno, my brother's
best friend, and this is Mea, my best friend. I never had a friend like
her in all my life. This is Kurt--"

"Kurt is my friend," said the uncle; "I know him because he is the poet.
I hope he'll make songs about us all now; I know the one about Mr.
Trius."

Quite taken aback, Kurt looked at the Baron. How could he know that
song? His mother had strictly forbidden him to show it to anyone, and he
had only read it aloud at home. How could a stranger hear about it?

"You can say in your new song that Mr. Castle-Steward and Mr. Trius are
two persons and not one; you can see that yourself," Maezli declared
aloud.

Kurt then suddenly understood that his impudent small sister had probably
been the informer and he did not know what to answer.

But Leonore helped him over his embarrassment by continuing, "This is
Lippo, Uncle, who has asked me to live with him when he is grown up.
Isn't he a wonderful friend, Uncle? He knew I had no home."

"You have quite marvellous friends, Leonore," said the Baron; "they must
visit you very often, if Mrs. Maxa will allow it."

"Gladly, and I know that their happiness will be yours, too, when you see
them all wandering through the house and garden."

"Yes, all of us, and Salo, too," Leonore exclaimed. "Do you think Salo
will soon be here, Uncle?"

Apollonie had approached the lively group under the pine tree, and as
there happened to be a suitable pause, she announced that dinner was
ready.

"I really ought to invite my dear friend, Mrs. Maxa, to come to the
table _with me_; I shall ask, however, who is going to take me?" said the
Baron.

All the children immediately cried, "I," "I," "I," "I," "I," "I," and
hands caught hold of the back and both sides of the Baron's chair.

"I am driving in a coach and six to-day! How things have changed for me!"
the gentleman said smilingly. The meal Apollonie had planned was a great
success and the open air on the terrace added to the children's
enjoyment.

When the fruit course, which consisted of yellow plums, was eaten, the
Baron gave the young birds, as he called the children, permission to fly
freely about. It seemed to crown all the preceding pleasures to be able
to roam without restraint in the woods and meadows. First of all they
ran towards the adjoining woods, where their need for an outlet could be
gratified.

"Long years to you, Leonore!" Bruno cried. "Now you and Salo are going
to have a wonderful home quite near to us. Isn't it splendid! When Salo
comes, we shall be together."

"Long live the Baron!" Kurt screamed now with all his might. "Hurrah for
Castle Wildenstein, the wonderful new home! Long live Apollonie! But
where is Loneli?" he suddenly interrupted himself in the midst of his
outburst; "she ought to be here, too."

When everybody agreed with him, Kurt dashed towards the terrace where
Loneli was just helping her grandmother carry away the dishes.

"We want to have Loneli with us, Apollonie. Please let her come with
me," Kurt explained his errand.

"Who wants her, do you say?" Apollonie began rather severely, despite a
glad note in her voice which could not be disguised.

"Everybody does, and Leonore especially," was Kurt's sly answer.

"You can go, Loneli," said the grandmother. "You must celebrate this
great day with them."

Loneli actually glowed with joy when she ran off with Kurt.

As they were sitting under the pine tree, the Baron and Mrs. Maxa were
reviving memories of long ago, and he listened with great emotion when
Mrs. Maxa told him how faithfully his mother had tried to send him news.
Her letters had, however, miscarried, because he had changed his
residence so frequently. But he had wanted him to know how constant his
mother's love had been and how anxiously she was waiting his return.

"Mrs. Maxa," he said after a little pause, "I feel terribly ashamed. I
came here with anger and hate in my heart against God and man, and my
only hope was to die as soon as possible. I expected to be forsaken and
despised, and instead of that I meet only kindness and love on every
side. I never deserved such a thing! Do you think I can ever atone for
all the wrong I've done?"

"We must always bear in mind that there is One who is glad to forgive us
our sins, Baron, and He can deliver us from them if we sincerely beg Him
to," Mrs. Maxa answered.

As the Baron remained silent, Mrs. Maxa added, "Will you let me say
something to you on the strength of our old friendship, Baron Bruno?"

"Certainly. I can trust my dear Maxa to say only what is right," he
replied.

"I have noticed that you have evaded mentioning the name Salo, that you
seemed reluctant to answer Leonore's questions concerning his possible
coming. I know that bitter memories are connected with the name, but I
also want you to know that you will deprive yourself of a great blessing
if you banish the boy who bears that name."

"Please let him come here, if only for a little while," Mrs. Maxa
begged, yet more strongly, "so that you can see him. If you can't
willingly see him who may be the pride and joy of your life, then open
the door of his home because, before God, it is right, which you must
feel as fully as I."

The Baron was silent, then finally said, "Salo may come."

Mrs. Maxa's face shone with joy and gratitude. Many things had still to
be discussed, and the two old friends remained sitting under the pine
tree till the last rays of the setting sun were throwing a rosy light
over the gray castle. The children were at last returning from their
walk across the meadows. They looked like a full-blown garden when they
approached the Baron's chair, for they were covered with garlands of
poppies, ivy and cornflowers. Now supper was announced, and the Baron
was escorted to the terrace as before. It was a true triumphal march
this time, when he, throned in his chair with the lion-skin on his knees,
was pushed along by the gaily decked children. The Baron told them how
much he would enjoy taking a similar ride into the fields some day.

When Mrs. Maxa gave the sign for parting after the merry supper party,
no sign of grief was shown because the Baron had already told them that
Leonore was to move up into the castle in a few days. They were all to
be present then. After that there would be no end to their visits.

When the Baron shook Maezli's hand at parting, he said, "You came to see
me first, Maezli, so you shall always be my special friend."

"Yes, I'll be your friend," Maezli said firmly.

When Leonore tenderly took leave of her uncle she whispered in his ear,
"May Salo come soon, Uncle?"

This time the answer was a clear affirmative, and the child's heart was
filled with rapture.

"Oh, Aunt Maxa," he cried aloud, "Can't we sing our evening song up here?
I should love to sing the song my mother used to sing."

When consent was given, they grouped themselves about the Baron's chair
and sang:

   God, Who disposes all things well,
   I want but what Thou givest me.
   Oh how can we Thine acts foretell,
   When Thou are far more wise than we?

All the way home the children kept looking back at the castle, for their
day had been too marvellous.

The next day three letters were sent to Salo, one from Bruno and one from
Leonore, both full of enthusiasm about the great event of the day before;
and one from Mrs. Maxa. The last thrilled Salo most, because it
contained a summons for him to come to his new home.

The news that Baron Bruno had come back and that Apollonie had resumed
her old post at the castle had spread all over the neighborhood.
Everybody had heard that Loneli also was living at the castle, that Baron
Salo's daughter had come, and his son was soon to be there. The report
that Mrs. Rector Bergmann's whole family had spent a day at the castle
was reported, too, and everybody talked about the intimate friendship of
the two families.

A few days after the celebration at the castle the district attorney's
wife came to call on Mrs. Maxa. She lost no time in telling her hostess
that she counted on Baron Salo's son joining the other three lads in town
and that her husband had agreed to look up another room for him. She had
no doubt that the sons of the three most important families of Nolla
ought naturally to live and study together, and she knew that every
effort would be made to find Salo a suitable room, even if the
application came rather late. Mrs. Maxa did not need to mind these
annoying negotiations now, but calmly replied that the Baron would send
his nephew to the high school in the city and would undoubtedly make his
own arrangements. Mrs. Knippel, after remarking that her husband
counted on seeing the Baron himself, withdrew. A moment after she left
Loneli came into the house to see Mea.

"Just think, Mea," the peace-loving Loneli said to her, "I have a message
for you from Elvira; she wants you to know that she is willing to forgive
you on condition that she may meet Leonore. She wants to be her friend
and sit beside her in school."

"It's too late now, and it won't help her. I don't care whether she
wants to make up with me or not," Mea said placidly. "Neither Leonore
nor I are going to school. You won't have to go either, Loneli, because
a lady is coming to the castle to teach us all. Baron Wallerstaetten and
mama have settled it, so I know it."

Loneli could hardly believe her ears, the surprise seemed too great.
"Then I shan't have to sit on the shame-bench any more," she said with a
beaming face, for a heavy trouble was removed from her heart.

"You can ask Leonore if she wants to meet Elvira," said Mea, for Leonore
had stepped up to them.

But Loneli's message held no interest whatever for Leonore, who wished
for no new acquaintances. She only desired to give the time she was not
spending with her uncle to Mea and her brothers and sisters. Least of
all she wished to meet a girl who had been so disagreeable to her beloved
Mea.

Uncle Philip had been away on a business trip. On his arrival home he
received the following note from his sister: "If you still want to see
Leonore with us, come as soon as possible. She is going to live with her
uncle at the castle in a very few days. I shall tell you all about it
when you come."

He arrived the very next morning, and as soon as he met his sister, he
exploded: "I was quite sure, Maxa, that you would immediately deliver the
little dove into the vulture's claws. I wish I had never put her in your
care!"

"Come in, Philip and sit down," Mrs. Maxa said composedly. "We are
going to have dinner in a moment, and then you will have the chance to
ask the dove herself what she thinks of the vulture's claws."

Uncle Philip opened the door and found the children absolutely immersed
in the recent events. The instant he stepped over the threshold they
rushed up to him and fairly flooded him with news. Their speeches came
thick and fast, and he heard nothing but manifestations of love for the
dear, good Baron, Leonore's charming uncle, the good, kind
Castle-Steward. Maezli had not given up this title even now.

"Do you see, Philip, that you can't swim against the stream?" said Mrs.
Maxa when she was sitting alone with her brother after dinner. "The best
thing you can do is to pay your old friend a call; that would add you to
the list of his admirers, instead of your bearing him a grudge."

But Uncle Philip violently objected to this proposal.

"Baron Bruno spoke of you with a sincere feeling of attachment which you
apparently don't deserve," his sister said. "He was afraid of your
feeling towards him, though. Listen to what he said 'I fear that he
won't wish to have anything to do with me, and I shall be powerless in
that case.'"

"I won't refuse the hand of an old friend, though, Maxa," said the
brother now, "if he offers it to me to reestablish peace. What is he
going to do for Salo's son?"

"Salo has already been sent word that he is to have the castle of his
ancestors for a home," replied Mrs. Maxa.

"I am going out for a walk," Uncle Philip said suddenly, taking down his
hat from the peg, and Mrs. Maxa guessed quite well where he was going.
He reappeared at supper time and sat down with merry eyes in the midst of
them all.

"Leonore," he began, "as soon as you are the mistress of the castle, I
shall often be your guest. Your uncle and I have just done some business
together. He told me how different everything used to be in the castle
grounds and that he regretted not understanding about these matters. So
he asked me to take charge of things, as they were in my special field.
He hoped my old attachment to the place"--at these words Uncle Philip's
voice became quite hoarse suddenly--"Maxa, your plum-cake is so sweet it
makes one hoarse," he said, for he would never admit that he had been
overcome by deep emotion. "So I have undertaken to attend to the matter
and I shall often come to the castle."

That Uncle Philip belonged to the castle, too, now awoke hearty outbursts
from the children, which the mother happily joined, for it had been her
greatest wish that the two should become friends again.

The last evening before Leonore was to move into the castle had come, and
the children were all sitting in a little corner. They were in the most
cheerful mood, busily making delightful plans for the future. Suddenly
the door opened, and wild shrieks of joy burst from everybody. "Salo,
Salo, Salo!" they all cried out. The boy had just arrived in time to
have a last splendid evening with his friends before moving into his new
home. The next day turned out more wonderful than they had ever dared to
dream, and it was followed again by a succession of other days as
delightful. Every time the children came together it seemed like a new
party, and the Baron took great care that those parties did not end too
quickly.

Kurt had soon informed Salo and Bruno that there was a large hall with
weapons and armor at the ground floor of the castle. When the boys asked
Apollonie to admit them, she opened a little side door for them, because
Mr. Trius had hidden the other key. Salo lifted the armoured knight to
his shoulders, and had the long, blue cloak draped around him. He looked
like a frightful giant as he wandered up and down the big room, and Kurt
recognized the ghost of Wildenstein he had seen that dreadful night.

Salo, with his charming disposition, soon entirely won over his uncle,
who decided to send his nephew to the neighboring town to study, and Salo
and Bruno were to spend their study-time as well as their holidays
together.

When the summer holidays were over, Salo and Bruno moved into town, but
even this leave-taking did not prove very hard. The children were not to
be separated very long, for the boys were to spend many week-ends at
home, besides all their holidays. Bruno had soon written to his mother
from town that she need not worry at all about the Knippel boys, as they
scarcely ever saw them.

When Mrs. Maxa cannot help recalling all her former fears and plans for
the future because her son's violent temper caused her such anxiety, she
said to herself with a glad heart:

   Oh how can we Thine acts foretell,
   When Thou are far more wise than we?

Apollonie has become the real, true Castle-Apollonie of yore and manages
for her master's sake to live in undisturbed peace with Mr. Trius. She
is taking such good care of the Baron and his little adopted daughter
that a bloom of health has spread over their cheeks. On sunny days the
Baron can frequently be seen walking up and down the terrace on Leonore's
arm, and his young guide is very careful of his health and looks after
him tenderly. The sound of a beautiful voice can often be heard through
the open castle windows, for Leonore has inherited her mother's voice,
and it gives her uncle the keenest pleasure to listen to the songs she
used to sing in bygone days. The people in Nolla unanimously agree that
the ghost of Wildenstein has gone to his eternal rest, because peace
again is reigning at the castle.
