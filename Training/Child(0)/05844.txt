I. GENTLE SISTER SOUTH WIND ARRIVES


"Good news, good news for every one, above or down below, For Master
Winsome Bluebird's come to whistle off the snow!"

All the Green Meadows and all the Green Forest had heard the news. Peter
Rabbit had seen to that. And just as soon as each of the little meadow
and forest folks heard it, he hurried out to listen for himself and
make sure that it was true. And each, when he heard that sweet voice of
Winsome Bluebird, had kicked up his heels and shouted "Hurrah!"

You see they all knew that Winsome Bluebird never is very far ahead of
gentle Sister South Wind, and that when she arrives, blustering, rough
Brother North Wind is already on his way back to the cold, cold land
where the ice never melts.

Of course Winsome Bluebird doesn't really whistle off the snow, but
after he comes, the snow disappears so fast that it seems as if he did.
It is surprising what a difference a little good news makes. Of course
nothing had really changed that first day when Winsome Bluebird's
whistle was heard on the Green Meadows and in the Green Forest, but it
seemed as if everything had changed. And it was all because that sweet
whistle was a promise, a promise that every one knew would come true.
And so there was joy in all the hearts on the Green Meadows and in the
Green Forest. Even grim old Granny Fox felt it, and as for Reddy Fox,
why, Reddy even shouted good-naturedly to Peter Rabbit and hoped he was
feeling well.

And then gentle Sister South Wind arrived. She came in the night, and in
the morning there she was, hard at work making the Green Meadows and the
Green Forest ready for Mistress Spring. She broke the icy bands that had
bound the Smiling Pool and the Laughing Brook so long; and the Smiling
Pool began to smile once more, and the Laughing Brook to gurgle and then
to laugh and finally to sing merrily.

She touched the little banks of snow that remained, and straightway
they melted and disappeared. She kissed the eight babies of Unc' Billy
Possum, and they kicked off the bedclothes under which old Mrs. Possum
had tucked them and scrambled out of the big hollow tree to play.

She peeped in at the door of Johnny Chuck and called softly, and Johnny
Chuck awoke from his long sleep and yawned and began to think about
getting up. She knocked at the door of Digger the Badger, and Digger
awoke. She tickled the nose of Striped Chipmunk, who was about half
awake, and Striped Chipmunk sneezed and then he hopped out of bed
and hurried up to his doorway to shout good morning after her, as she
hurried over to see if Bobby Coon was still sleeping.

Peter Rabbit followed her about. He couldn't understand it at all. Peter
had smiled to himself when he heard how softly she had called at the
doorway of Johnny Chuck's house, for many and many a time during the
long winter Peter had stopped at Johnny Chuck's house and shouted down
the long hall at the top of his voice without once waking Johnny Chuck.
Now Peter nearly tumbled over with surprise, as he heard Johnny Chuck
yawn at the first low call of gentle Sister South Wind.

"How does she do it? I don't understand it at all," said Peter, as he
scratched his long left ear with his long left hind leg.

Gentle Sister South Wind smiled at Peter. "There are a lot of things in
this world that you will never understand, Peter Rabbit. You will just
have to believe them without understanding them and be content to know
that they are so," she said, and hurried over to the Green Forest to
tell Unc' Billy Possum that his old friend, Ol' Mistah Buzzard, was on
his way up from ol' Virginny.




II. JOHNNY CHUCK RECEIVES CALLERS


The morning after gentle Sister South Wind arrived on the Green Meadows,
Peter Rabbit came hopping and skipping down the Lone Little Path from
the Green Forest. Peter was happy. He didn't know why. He just was
happy. It was in the air. Everybody else seemed happy, too. Peter had
to stop every few minutes just to kick up his heels and try to jump over
his own shadow. He had felt just that way ever since gentle Sister South
Wind arrived.

    "I simply have to kick and dance!
     I cannot help but gaily prance!
     Somehow I feel it in my toes
     Whenever gentle South Wind blows."

So sang Peter Rabbit as he hopped and skipped down the Lone Little Path.
Suddenly he stopped right in the middle of the verse. He sat up very
straight and stared down at Johnny Chuck's house. Some one was sitting
on Johnny Chuck's door-step. It looked like Johnny Chuck. No, it looked
like the shadow of Johnny Chuck. Peter rubbed his eyes and looked again.
Then he hurried as fast as he could, lipperty-lipperty-lip. The nearer
he got, the less like Johnny Chuck looked the one sitting on Johnny
Chuck's door-step. Johnny Chuck had gone to sleep round and fat and
roly-poly, so fat he could hardly waddle. This fellow was thin, even
thinner than Peter Rabbit himself. He waved a thin hand to Peter.

"Hello, Peter Rabbit! I told you that I would see you in the spring. How
did you stand the long winter?"

That certainly was Johnny Chuck's voice. Peter was so delighted that in
his hurry he fell over his own feet. "Is it really and truly you, Johnny
Chuck?" he cried.

"Of course it's me; who did you think it was?" replied Johnny Chuck
rather crossly, for Peter was staring at him as if he had never seen him
before.

"I--I--I didn't know," confessed Peter Rabbit. "I thought it was you and
