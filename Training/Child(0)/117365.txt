THE SWAN.


The Swan is a very beautiful bird. It is generally white, though a black
swan has been discovered in Australia. It is not very often seen in this
country. It was brought from Asia and Eastern Europe into England--from
whence, most probably, a few specimens have been introduced into this
country. The Swan is very graceful in the water, but on land it is an
awkward waddler.

THE COOT.


The Coot is generally found in large sheets of water, particularly if
shaded by trees. The nest is a mass of flags, reeds, and grass, usually
at the water's edge, but sometimes actually in the water. The Coot's
eggs are generally seven in number. They are of a greenish-white,
spotted.

THE DABCHICK.


The Dabchick is a very timid bird, and when alarmed instantly dives,
after which it is useless to look after the bird. It is easily
domesticated, and is often seen placed as an ornament to ponds, where it
swims about very merrily, and seems to enjoy a game of hide and seek
with any one who is attempting to watch its movements.
