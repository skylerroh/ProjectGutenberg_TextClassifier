  THE PETER PATTER BOOK

  JINGLE, JINGLE, JACK, A COPPER DOWN A CRACK]

  A COPPER DOWN A CRACK


  Jingle, jingle, Jack,
  A copper down a crack.
  Twenty men and all their wives,
  With sticks and picks and pocket knives,
  Digging for their very lives
  To get the copper back.




  I'M MUCH TOO BIG FOR A FAIRY


  I'm much too big for a fairy,
  And much too small for a man,
  But this is true:
  Whatever I do,
  I do it the best I can.




  DID YOU EVER PLAY TAG WITH A TIGER?


  Did you ever play tag with a tiger,
  Or ever play boo with a bear;
  Did you ever put rats in the rain-barrel
  To give poor old Granny a scare?

  It's fun to play tag with a tiger,
  It's fun for the bear to say "boo,"
  But if rats are found in the rain-barrel
  Old Granny will put you in too.

  THE BLUE SONG


  Hot mush and molasses all in a blue bowl--
  Eat it, it's good for you, sonny.
  'T will make you grow tall as a telephone pole--
  Eat it, it's good for you, sonny.

  Fresh fish and potatoes all on a blue plate--
  Eat it up smart now, my sonny.
  'T will make you as jolly and fat as Aunt Kate--
  Eat it up quick now, my sonny.

  Sweet milk from a nanny-goat in a blue cup--
  Drink it, it's good for you, sonny,
  'T will fill you, expand you, and help you grow up,
  And make a real man of you, sonny.




  HIPPITY HOP TO BED


  O it's hippity hop to bed!
  I'd rather sit up instead.
  But when father says "must,"
  There's nothing but just
  Go hippity hop to bed.

  AWAY TO THE RIVER


  Away to the river, away to the wood,
  While the grasses are green and the berries are good!
  Where the locusts are scraping their fiddles and bows,
  And the bees keep a-coming wherever one goes.

  Oh, it's off to the river and off to the hills,
  To the land of the bloodroot and wild daffodils,
  With a buttercup blossom to color my chin,
  And a basket of burs to put sandberries in.




  [Illustration]

  OUR LITTLE PAT


  Our little Pat
  Was chasing the cat
  And kicking the kittens about.
  When mother said "Quit!"
  He ran off to sit
  On the top of the woodpile and pout;
  But a sly little grin
  Soon slid down his chin
  And let all the sulkiness out.




  THE ANIMAL SHOW


  Father and mother and Bobbie will go
  To see all the sights at the animal show.
  Where lions and bears
  Sit on dining room chairs,
  Where a camel is able
  To stand on a table,
  Where monkeys and seals
  All travel on wheels,
  And a Zulu baboon
  Rides a baby balloon.
  The sooner you're ready, the sooner we'll go.
  Aboard, all aboard, for the Animal Show!

  TOMMY TRIMBLE


  Billy be nimble,
  Hurry and see
  Old Tommy Trimble
  Climbing a tree.
  He claws with his fingers
  And digs with his toes.
  The longer he lingers
  The slower he goes.

  DICKIE, DICKIE DEXTER


  Dickie, Dickie Dexter
  Had a wife and vexed her.
  She put him in a rabbit cage
  And fed him peppermint and sage--
  Dickie, Dickie Dexter.




  ON THE ROAD TO TATTLETOWN


  On the road to Tattletown
  What is this I see?
  A pig upon a pedestal,
  A cabbage up a tree,
  A rabbit cutting capers
  With a twenty dollar bill--
  Now if I don't get to Tattletown
  Then no one ever will.




  POLLY AND PETER


  Polly had some china cows
  And Peter had a gun.
  She turned the bossies out to browse,
  And Peterkin, for fun,
  Just peppered them with butter beans
  And blew them all to smithereens.

         *       *       *

  Now what will pretty Polly do
  For milk and cream and butter too?




  I WENT TO TOWN ON MONDAY


  I went to town on Monday
  To buy myself a coat,
  But on the way I met a man
  Who traveled with a caravan,
  And bought a billy-goat.

  I went to town on Tuesday
  And bought a fancy vest.
  I kept the pretty bucklestraps,
  Buttonholes and pocketflaps,
  And threw away the rest.

  [Illustration]

  I went to town on Thursday
  To buy a loaf of bread,
  But when I got there, goodness sakes!
  The town was full of rattlesnakes--
  The bakers all were dead.

  [Illustration]

  I went to town on Saturday
  To get myself a wife,
  But when I saw the lady fair
  I gnashed my teeth and pulled my hair
  And scampered for my life.




  [Illustration]

  WHERE ARE YOU GOING?


  Where are you going, sister Kate?
  I'm going to swing on the garden gate,
  And watch the fairy gypsies dance
  Their tim-tam-tum on the cabbage-plants--
  The great big one with the purple nose,
  And the tiny tad with the pinky toes.

  Where are you going, brother Ben?
  I'm going to build a tiger-pen.
  I'll get iron and steel and 'lectric wire
  And build it a hundred feet, or higher,
  And put ten tigers in it too,
  And a big wildcat, and--mebbe--you.

  [Illustration]

  Where are you going, mother mine?
  I'm going to sit by the old grapevine,
  And watch the gliding swallow bring
  Clay for her nest from the meadow spring--
  Clay and straw and a bit of thread
  To weave it into a baby's bed.

  [Illustration]

  Where are you going, grandma dear?
  I'm going, love, where the skies are clear,
  And the light winds lift the poppy flowers
  And gather clouds for the summer showers,
  Where the old folks and the children play
  On the warm hillside through the livelong day.
