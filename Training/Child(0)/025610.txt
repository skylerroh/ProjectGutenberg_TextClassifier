  TO ALISON CUNNINGHAM
  FROM HER BOY

    FOR THE LONG NIGHTS YOU LAY AWAKE
    AND WATCHED FOR MY UNWORTHY SAKE:
    FOR YOUR MOST COMFORTABLE HAND
    THAT LED ME THROUGH THE UNEVEN LAND:
    FOR ALL THE STORY BOOKS YOU READ:
    FOR ALL THE PAINS YOU COMFORTED:
    FOR ALL YOU PITIED, ALL YOU BORE,
    IN SAD AND HAPPY DAYS OF YORE:--
    MY SECOND MOTHER, MY FIRST WIFE.
    THE ANGEL OF MY INFANT LIFE--
    FROM THE SICK CHILD, NOW WELL AND OLD,
    TAKE, NURSE, THE LITTLE BOOK YOU HOLD!

    AND GRANT IT, HEAVEN, THAT ALL WHO READ
    MAY FIND AS DEAR A NURSE AT NEED,
    AND EVERY CHILD WHO LISTS MY RHYME,
    IN THE BRIGHT, FIRESIDE, NURSERY CLIME,
    MAY HEAR IT IN AS KIND A VOICE
    AS MADE MY CHILDISH DAYS REJOICE!
