        He comes to our house every day,
        An' waters the horses, an' feeds 'em hay;
        An' he opens the shed--an' we all ist laugh
        When he drives out our little old wobblely calf;
        An' nen--ef our hired girl says he can--
        He milks the cow fer 'Lizabuth Ann.--
          Aint he a' awful good Raggedy Man?
            Raggedy! Raggedy! Raggedy Man!

        W'y, The Raggedy Man--he's ist so good
        He splits the kindlin' an' chops the wood;
        An' nen he spades in our garden, too,
        An' does most things 'at _boys_ can't do!--
        He clumbed clean up in our big tree
        An' shooked a' apple down fer me--
        An' nother'n', too, fer 'Lizabuth Ann--
        An' nother'n', too, fer The Raggedy Man--
          Aint he a' awful kind Raggedy Man?
            Raggedy! Raggedy! Raggedy Man!

        An' The Raggedy Man, he knows most rhymes
        An' tells 'em, ef I be good, sometimes:
        Knows 'bout Giunts, an' Griffuns, an' Elves,
        An' the Squidgicum-Squees 'at swallers therselves!
        An', wite by the pump in our pasture-lot,
        He showed me the hole 'at the Wunks is got,
        'At lives 'way deep in the ground, an' can
        Turn into me, er 'Lizabuth Ann!
          Aint he a funny old Raggedy Man?
            Raggedy! Raggedy! Raggedy Man!

        The Raggedy Man--one time when he
        Wuz makin' a little bow-'n'-orry fer me,
        Says "When _you're_ big like your Pa is,
        Air you go' to keep a fine store like his--
        An' be a rich merchunt--an' wear fine clothes?--
        Er what _air_ you go' to be, goodness knows!"
        An' nen he laughed at 'Lizabuth Ann,
        An' I says "'M go' to be a Raggedy Man!
          I'm ist go' to be a nice Raggedy Man!
            Raggedy! Raggedy! Raggedy Man!"

        James Hogg (1770-1835) was a poet of Scotland
        and a contemporary of Sir Walter Scott. He was
        known as the Ettrick Shepherd, from the place
        of his birth and from the fact that as a boy he
        tended the sheep. He had little schooling and
        was a thoroughly self-made man. The strongly
        marked and energetic swing of the rhythm,
        fitting in so well with the vigorous
        out-of-door experiences suggested, has made "A
        Boy's Song" a great favorite. Other poems of
        his that are still read are "The Skylark" and
        the verse fairy tale called "Kilmeny."


A BOY'S SONG

JAMES HOGG

        Where the pools are bright and deep,
        Where the gray trout lies asleep,
        Up the river and o'er the lea,
        That's the way for Billy and me.

        Where the blackbird sings the latest,
        Where the hawthorn blooms the sweetest,
        Where the nestlings chirp and flee,
        That's the way for Billy and me.

        Where the mowers mow the cleanest,
        Where the hay lies thick and greenest,
        There to track the homeward bee,
        That's the way for Billy and me.

        Where the hazel bank is steepest,
        Where the shadow falls the deepest,
        Where the clustering nuts fall free,
        That's the way for Billy and me.

        Why the boys should drive away
        Little sweet maidens from the play,
        Or love to banter and fight so well,
        That's the thing I never could tell.

        But this I know, I love to play,
        Through the meadow, among the hay;
        Up the river and o'er the lea,
        That's the way for Billy and me.

        Mary Howitt (1799-1888), an English author and
        translator, was the first to put Hans Christian
        Andersen's tales into English. She wrote on a
        great variety of subjects, and much of her work
        was useful and pleasing to a multitude of
        readers old and young. Besides the following
        poem, she is known well to young readers by her
        "The Fairies of Caldon-Low."


THE SPIDER AND THE FLY

MARY HOWITT

        "Will you walk into my parlor?"
          Said the Spider to the Fly;
        "'Tis the prettiest little parlor
          That ever you did spy.

        "The way into my parlor
          Is up a winding stair,
        And I have many curious things
          To show when you are there."

        "Oh, no, no," said the little Fly,
          "To ask me is in vain;
        For who goes up your winding stair
          Can ne'er come down again."

        "I'm sure you must be weary, dear,
          With soaring up so high;
        Will you rest upon my little bed?"
          Said the Spider to the Fly.

        "There are pretty curtains drawn around;
          The sheets are fine and thin,
        And if you like to rest awhile,
          I'll snugly tuck you in!"

        "Oh, no, no," said the little Fly,
          "For I've often heard it said,
        They never, never wake again,
          Who sleep upon your bed."

        Said the cunning Spider to the Fly:
          "Dear friend, what can I do
        To prove the warm affection
          I've always felt for you?

        "I have within my pantry
          Good store of all that's nice:
        I'm sure you're very welcome--
          Will you please to take a slice?"

        "Oh, no, no," said the little Fly,
          "Kind sir, that cannot be;
        I've heard what's in your pantry,
          And I do not wish to see."

        "Sweet creature!" said the Spider,
          "You're witty and you're wise;
        How handsome are your gauzy wings
          How brilliant are your eyes!

        "I have a little looking-glass
          Upon my parlor shelf;
        If you'll step in one moment, dear,
          You shall behold yourself."

        "I thank you, gentle sir," she said,
          "For what you're pleased to say,
        And, bidding you good-morning now,
          I'll call another day."

        The Spider turned him round about.
          And went into his den,
        For well he knew the silly Fly
          Would soon come back again:

        So he wove a subtle web
          In a little corner sly,
        And set his table ready
          To dine upon the Fly.

        Then came out to his door again,
          And merrily did sing:
        "Come hither, hither, pretty Fly,
          With the pearl and silver wing;

        "Your robes are green and purple--
          There's a crest upon your head;
        Your eyes are like the diamond bright,
          But mine are dull as lead!"

        Alas, alas! how very soon
          This silly little Fly,
        Hearing his wily, flattering words,
          Came slowly flitting by;

        With buzzing wings she hung aloft,
          Then near and nearer drew,
        Thinking only of her brilliant eyes,
          And green and purple hue--

        Thinking only of her crested head--
          Poor, foolish thing! At last,
        Up jumped the cunning Spider,
          And fiercely held her fast.

        He dragged her up his winding stair,
          Into his dismal den,
        Within his little parlor--
          But she ne'er came out again.

        And now, dear little children,
          Who may this story read,
        To idle, silly, flattering words,
          I pray you ne'er give heed.

        Unto an evil counsellor
          Close heart and ear and eye,
        And take a lesson from this tale
          Of the Spider and the Fly.

        William Howitt (1792-1879) and his wife, author
        of the preceding poem, worked together on many
        literary projects. One of William Howitt's
        poems, "The Wind in a Frolic," has long found a
        place in collections for children. It presents
        the wind in a sprightly, mischievous, and
        boisterous mood.


THE WIND IN A FROLIC

WILLIAM HOWITT

        The wind one morning sprang up from sleep,
        Saying, "Now for a frolic! now for a leap!
        Now for a madcap galloping chase!
        I'll make a commotion in every place!"

        So it swept with a bustle right through a great town,
        Cracking the signs and scattering down
        Shutters; and whisking, with merciless squalls,
        Old women's bonnets and gingerbread stalls,
        There never was heard a much lustier shout,
        As the apples and oranges trundled about;
        And the urchins that stand with their thievish eyes
        For ever on watch, ran off each with a prize.

        Then away to the field it went, blustering and humming,
        And the cattle all wondered whatever was coming;
        It plucked by the tails the grave matronly cows,
        And tossed the colts' manes all over their brows;
        Till, offended at such an unusual salute,
        They all turned their backs, and stood sulky and mute.

        So on it went capering and playing its pranks,
        Whistling with reeds on the broad river's banks,
        Puffing the birds as they sat on the spray,
        Or the traveller grave on the king's highway.
        It was not too nice to hustle the bags
        Of the beggar, and flutter his dirty rags;

        'Twas so bold that it feared not to play its joke
        With the doctor's wig or the gentleman's cloak.
        Through the forest it roared, and cried gaily, "Now,
        You sturdy old oaks, I'll make you bow!"
        And it made them bow without more ado,
        Or it cracked their great branches through and through.

        Then it rushed like a monster on cottage and farm,
        Striking their dwellers with sudden alarm;
        And they ran out like bees in a midsummer swarm;--

        There were dames with their kerchiefs tied over their caps,
        To see if their poultry were free from mishaps;
        The turkeys they gobbled, the geese screamed aloud,
        And the hens crept to roost in a terrified crowd;
        There was rearing of ladders, and logs laying on,
        Where the thatch from the roof threatened soon to be gone.

        But the wind had swept on, and had met in a lane
        With a schoolboy, who panted and struggled in vain;
        For it tossed him and twirled him, then passed, and he stood
        With his hat in a pool and his shoes in the mud.

        Then away went the wind in its holiday glee,
        And now it was far on the billowy sea,
        And the lordly ships felt its staggering blow,
        And the little boats darted to and fro.

        But lo! it was night, and it sank to rest
        On the sea-bird's rock in the gleaming West,
        Laughing to think, in its fearful fun,
        How little of mischief it really had done.




        Ann Taylor (1782-1866) and Jane Taylor
        (1783-1824), English writers of verse and prose
        for children, have earned a permanent place in
        the history of juvenile literature on account
        of the real worth of their work and because
        they were among the first authors to write
        poetry especially for children. They published
        jointly three volumes of verse for children:
        _Original Poems for Infant Minds_, _Rhymes for
        the Nursery_, and _Hymns for Infant Minds_.
        Many of their poems seem a little too didactic,
        but they were genuine in their ethical
        earnestness and largely succeeded in putting
        things in terms of the child's own
        comprehension. The four poems given here
        represent them at their best, which was good
        enough to win the admiration of Sir Walter
        Scott.

THE COW

ANN TAYLOR


        Thank you, pretty cow, that made
        Pleasant milk to soak my bread,
        Every day and every night,
        Warm, and fresh, and sweet, and white.

        Do not chew the hemlock rank,
        Growing on the weedy bank;
        But the yellow cowslips eat,
        That will make it very sweet.

        Where the purple violet grows,
        Where the bubbling water flows,
        Where the grass is fresh and fine,
        Pretty cow, go there and dine.

MEDDLESOME MATTY

ANN TAYLOR

        One ugly trick has often spoiled
          The sweetest and the best;
        Matilda, though a pleasant child,
          One ugly trick possessed,
        Which, like a cloud before the skies,
        Hid all her better qualities.

        Sometimes she'd lift the tea-pot lid,
          To peep at what was in it;
        Or tilt the kettle, if you did
          But turn your back a minute.
        In vain you told her not to touch,
        Her trick of meddling grew so much.

        Her grandmamma went out one day
          And by mistake she laid
        Her spectacles and snuff-box gay
          Too near the little maid;
        "Ah! well," thought she, "I'll try them on,
        As soon as grandmamma is gone."

        Forthwith she placed upon her nose
          The glasses large and wide;
        And looking round, as I suppose,
          The snuff-box too she spied:
        "Oh! what a pretty box is that;
        I'll open it," said little Matt.

        "I know that grandmamma would say,
          'Don't meddle with it, dear,'
        But then, she's far enough away,
          And no one else is near:
        Besides, what can there be amiss
        In opening such a box as this?"

        So thumb and finger went to work
          To move the stubborn lid,
        And presently a mighty jerk
          The mighty mischief did;
        For all at once, ah! woeful case,
        The snuff came puffing in her face.

        Poor eyes, and nose, and mouth beside
          A dismal sight presented;
        In vain, as bitterly she cried,
          Her folly she repented.
        In vain she ran about for ease;
        She could do nothing else but sneeze.

        She dashed the spectacles away,
          To wipe her tingling eyes,
        And as in twenty bits they lay,
          Her grandmamma she spies.
        "Heyday! and what's the matter now?"
        Says grandmamma with lifted brow.

        Matilda, smarting with the pain,
          And tingling still, and sore,
        Made many a promise to refrain
          From meddling evermore.
        And 'tis a fact, as I have heard,
        She ever since has kept her word.

"I LIKE LITTLE PUSSY"

JANE TAYLOR

        I like little Pussy,
          Her coat is so warm;
        And if I don't hurt her
          She'll do me no harm.
        So I'll not pull her tail,
          Nor drive her away,
        But Pussy and I
          Very gently will play;
        She shall sit by my side,
          And I'll give her some food;
        And she'll love me because
          I am gentle and good.

        I'll pat little Pussy,
          And then she will purr,
        And thus show her thanks
          For my kindness to her;
        I'll not pinch her ears,
          Nor tread on her paw,
        Lest I should provoke her
          To use her sharp claw;
        I never will vex her,
          Nor make her displeased,
        For Pussy can't bear
          To be worried or teased.



312


THE STAR

JANE TAYLOR

        Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
        How I wonder what you are.
        Up above the world so high,
        Like a diamond in the sky.

        When the blazing sun is gone,
        When he nothing shines upon,
        Then you show your little light,
        Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

        Then the traveler in the dark
        Thanks you for your tiny spark;
        He could not see which way to go,
        If you did not twinkle so.

        In the dark blue sky you keep,
        And often through my curtains peep,
        For you never shut your eye
        Till the sun is in the sky.

        As your bright and tiny spark
        Lights the traveler in the dark,
        Though I know not what you are,
        Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

        Although Christina G. Rossetti (1830-1894) is
        not known primarily as a writer for children,
        her _Sing-Song_, from which the next seven
        poems are taken, is a juvenile classic. She
        ranks very high among the women poets of the
        nineteenth century, her only equal being Mrs.
        Browning. Besides the brief poems in
        _Sing-Song_, Miss Rossetti's "Goblin Market"
        and "Uphill" please young people of a
        contemplative mood. While there is an
        undercurrent of sadness in much of her work, it
        is a natural accompaniment of her themes and is
        not unduly emphasized.



313


SELDOM OR NEVER

CHRISTINA G. ROSSETTI

        Seldom "can't,"
          Seldom "don't";
        Never "shan't,"
          Never "won't."



314


AN EMERALD IS AS GREEN AS GRASS

CHRISTINA G. ROSSETTI

        An emerald is as green as grass;
          A ruby, red as blood;
        A sapphire shines as blue as heaven;
          A flint lies in the mud.

        A diamond is a brilliant stone
          To catch the world's desire;
        An opal holds a fiery spark;
          But a flint holds fire.



315


BOATS SAIL ON THE RIVERS

CHRISTINA G. ROSSETTI

        Boats sail on the rivers,
          And ships sail on the seas;
        But clouds that sail across the sky
          Are prettier far than these.
        There are bridges on the rivers,
          As pretty as you please;
        But the bow that bridges heaven,
          And overtops the trees,
        And builds a road from earth to sky,
          Is prettier far than these.



316

A DIAMOND OR A COAL?

CHRISTINA G. ROSSETTI

        A diamond or a coal?
          A diamond, if you please;
        Who cares about a clumsy coal
          Beneath the summer trees?

        A diamond or a coal?
          A coal, sir, if you please;
        One comes to care about the coal
          At times when waters freeze.



317


THE SWALLOW

CHRISTINA G. ROSSETTI

        Fly away, fly away over the sea,
          Sun-loving swallow, for summer is done;
        Come again, come again, come back to me,
          Bringing the summer and bringing the sun.



318

WHO HAS SEEN THE WIND?

CHRISTINA G. ROSSETTI

        Who has seen the wind?
          Neither I nor you:
        But when the leaves hang trembling,
          The wind is passing thro'.

        Who has seen the wind?
          Neither you nor I:
        But when the trees bow down their heads,
          The wind is passing by.

MILKING TIME

CHRISTINA G. ROSSETTI

        When the cows come home the milk is coming;
        Honey's made while the bees are humming;
        Duck and drake on the rushy lake,
        And the deer live safe in the breezy brake;
        And timid, funny, pert little bunny
        Winks his nose, and sits all sunny.

        William Brighty Rands (1823-1882), an English
        author writing under the name of "Matthew
        Browne," produced in his _Lilliput Lyrics_ a
        juvenile masterpiece containing much verse
        worthy to live. The two poems that follow are
        decidedly successful in catching that elusive
        something called the child's point of view.


THE PEDDLER'S CARAVAN

WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS

        I wish I lived in a caravan
        With a horse to drive, like a peddler-man!
        Where he comes from nobody knows,
        Or where he goes to, but on he goes!

        His caravan has windows two,
        And a chimney of tin, that the smoke comes through;
        He has a wife, with a baby brown,
        And they go riding from town to town.

        Chairs to mend, and delf to sell!
        He clashes the basins like a bell;
        Tea-trays, baskets ranged in order,
        Plates, with alphabets round the border!

        The roads are brown, and the sea is green,
        But his house is like a bathing-machine;
        The world is round, and he can ride,
        Rumble and slash, to the other side!

        With the peddler-man I should like to roam,
        And write a book when I came home;
        All the people would read my book,
        Just like the Travels of Captain Cook!

THE WONDERFUL WORLD

WILLIAM BRIGHTY RANDS

        Great, wide, beautiful, wonderful World,
        With the wonderful water round you curled,
        And the wonderful grass upon your breast--
        World, you are beautifully dressed!

        The wonderful air is over me,
        And the wonderful wind is shaking the tree--
        It walks on the water, and whirls the mills,
        And talks to itself on the top of the hills.

        You friendly Earth, how far do you go,
        With the wheat-fields that nod and the rivers that flow,
        With cities and gardens and cliffs and isles,
        And the people upon you for thousands of miles?

        Ah! you are so great, and I am so small,
        I hardly can think of you, World, at all;
        And yet, when I said my prayers to-day,
        My mother kissed me, and said, quite gay,

        "If the wonderful World is great to you,
        And great to father and mother, too,
        You are more than the Earth, though you are such a dot!
        You can love and think, and the Earth cannot!"

        Richard Monckton Milnes (Lord Houghton,
        1809-1885), an English poet, wrote one poem
        that has held its own in children's
        collections. Its quiet mood of industry at one
        with the gentler influences of nature is
        especially appealing.


GOOD-NIGHT AND GOOD-MORNING

RICHARD MONCKTON MILNES

        A fair little girl sat under a tree,
        Sewing as long as her eyes could see;
        Then smoothed her work and folded it right
        And said, "Dear work, good-night, good-night!"

        Such a number of rooks came over her head,
        Crying "Caw! Caw!" on their way to bed,
        She said, as she watched their curious flight,
        "Little black things, good-night, good-night!"

        The horses neighed, and the oxen lowed,
        The sheep's "Bleat! Bleat!" came over the road;
        All seeming to say, with a quiet delight,
        "Good little girl, good-night, good-night!"

        She did not say to the sun, "Good-night!"
        Though she saw him there like a ball of light;
        For she knew he had God's time to keep
        All over the world and never could sleep.

        The tall pink foxglove bowed his head;
        The violets curtsied, and went to bed;
        And good little Lucy tied up her hair,
        And said, on her knees, her favorite prayer.

        And while on her pillow she softly lay,
        She knew nothing more till again it was day;
        And all things said to the beautiful sun,
        "Good-morning, good-morning! our work is begun."

        It is quite impossible for us to realize why
        the English reading public should have been so
        excited over the following poem in the years
        immediately following its first appearance in
        1806. It attracted the attention of royalty,
        was set to music, had a host of imitators, and
        established itself as a nursery classic. It was
        written by William Roscoe (1753-1831),
        historian, banker, and poet, for his son
        Robert, and was merely an entertaining skit
        upon an actual banquet. Probably the fact that
        the characters at the butterfly's ball were
        drawn with human faces in the original
        illustrations to represent the prominent guests
        at the actual banquet had much to do with the
        initial success. The impulse which it received
        a hundred years ago, coupled with its own
        undoubted power of fancy, has projected it thus
        far, and children seem inclined to approve and
        still further insure its already long life.


THE BUTTERFLY'S BALL

WILLIAM ROSCOE

        "Come, take up your hats, and away let us haste
        To the Butterfly's Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast,
        The Trumpeter, Gadfly, has summon'd the crew,
        And the Revels are now only waiting for you."
        So said little Robert, and pacing along,
        His merry Companions came forth in a throng,
        And on the smooth Grass by the side of a Wood,
        Beneath a broad oak that for ages had stood,
        Saw the Children of Earth and the Tenants of Air
        For an Evening's Amusement together repair.

        And there came the Beetle, so blind and so black,
        Who carried the Emmet, his friend, on his back,
        And there was the Gnat and the Dragonfly too,
        With all their Relations, green, orange and blue.
        And there came the Moth, with his plumage of down,
        And the Hornet in jacket of yellow and brown;
        Who with him the Wasp, his companion, did bring,
        But they promised that evening to lay by their sting.
        And the sly little Dormouse crept out of his hole,
        And brought to the Feast his blind Brother, the Mole;
        And the Snail, with his horns peeping out of his shell,
        Came from a great distance, the length of an ell.

        A Mushroom, their Table, and on it was laid
        A water-dock leaf, which a table-cloth made.
        The Viands were various, to each of their taste,
        And the Bee brought her honey to crown the Repast.
        Then close on his haunches, so solemn and wise,
        The Frog from a corner look'd up to the skies;
        And the Squirrel, well pleased such diversion to see,
        Mounted high overhead and look'd down from a tree.
        Then out came the Spider, with finger so fine,
        To show his dexterity on the tight-line,
        From one branch to another his cobwebs he slung,
        Then quick as an arrow he darted along,
        But just in the middle--oh! shocking to tell,
        From his rope, in an instant, poor Harlequin fell.
        Yet he touch'd not the ground, but with talons outspread,
        Hung suspended in air, at the end of a thread.

        Then the Grasshopper came with a jerk and a spring,
        Very long was his Leg, though but short was his Wing;
        He took but three leaps, and was soon out of sight,
        Then chirp'd his own praises the rest of the night.
        With step so majestic the Snail did advance,
        And promised the Gazers a Minuet to dance;
        But they all laughed so loud that he pulled in his head,
        And went in his own little chamber to bed.
        Then as Evening gave way to the shadows of Night,
        Their Watchman, the Glowworm, came out with a light.
        "Then Home let us hasten while yet we can see,
        For no Watchman is waiting for you and for me."
        So said little Robert, and pacing along,
        His merry Companions return'd in a throng.

CAN YOU?

AUTHOR UNKNOWN

        Can you put the spider's web back in place
          That once has been swept away?
        Can you put the apple again on the bough
          Which fell at our feet to-day?
        Can you put the lily-cup back on the stem
          And cause it to live and grow?
        Can you mend the butterfly's broken wing
          That you crush with a hasty blow?
        Can you put the bloom again on the grape
          And the grape again on the vine?
        Can you put the dewdrops back on the flowers
          And make them sparkle and shine?
        Can you put the petals back on the rose?
          If you could, would it smell as sweet?
        Can you put the flour again in the husk,
          And show me the ripened wheat?
        Can you put the kernel again in the nut,
          Or the broken egg in the shell?
        Can you put the honey back in the comb,
          And cover with wax each cell?
        Can you put the perfume back in the vase
          When once it has sped away?
        Can you put the corn-silk back on the corn,
          Or down on the catkins, say?
        You think my questions are trifling, lad,
          Let me ask you another one:
        Can a hasty word be ever unsaid,
          Or a deed unkind, undone?

        In 1841 Robert Browning (1812-1889) published a
        drama in verse entitled _Pippa Passes_. Pippa
        was a little girl who worked in the silkmills
        of an Italian city. When her one holiday of the
        year came, she arose early and went singing out
        of town to the hills to enjoy the day. Various
        people who were planning to do evil heard her
        songs as she passed and did not do the wicked
        things they had intended to do. The next day
        Pippa returned to her usual work and never knew
        that her songs had changed the lives of many
        people. The following is the first of Pippa's
        songs.


PIPPA'S SONG

ROBERT BROWNING

        The year's at the spring,
        And day's at the morn;
        Morning's at seven;
        The hill-side's dew-pearled;
        The lark's on the wing;
        The snail's on the thorn;
        God's in His Heaven--
        All's right with the world!

        Charles Mackay (1814-1889) was an English
        journalist, poet, and miscellaneous writer. He
        was especially popular as a writer of songs,
        composing both words and music. Other
        well-known poems of his are "The Miller of Dee"
        and "Tubal Cain." "Little and Great" presents a
        familiar idea through a series of
        illustrations--the idea that great and lasting
        results may spring from unstudied deeds of
        helpfulness and love.


LITTLE AND GREAT

CHARLES MACKAY

        A traveler on a dusty road
          Strewed acorns on the lea;
        And one took root and sprouted up,
          And grew into a tree.
        Love sought its shade at evening-time,
          To breathe its early vows;
        And Age was pleased, in heats of noon,
          To bask beneath its boughs.
        The dormouse loved its dangling twigs,
          The birds sweet music bore--
        It stood a glory in its place,
          A blessing evermore.

        A little spring had lost its way
          Amid the grass and fern;
        A passing stranger scooped a well
          Where weary men might turn;
        He walled it in, and hung with care
          A ladle at the brink;
        He thought not of the deed he did,
          But judged that Toil might drink.
        He passed again; and lo! the well,
          By summer never dried,
        Had cooled ten thousand parched tongues,
          And saved a life beside.

        A dreamer dropped a random thought;
          'Twas old, and yet 'twas new;
        A simple fancy of the brain,
          But strong in being true.
        It shone upon a genial mind,
          And, lo! its light became
        A lamp of life, a beacon ray,
          A monitory flame.
        The thought was small; its issue great;
          A watch-fire on the hill,
        It sheds its radiance far adown,
          And cheers the valley still.

        A nameless man, amid the crowd
          That thronged the daily mart,
        Let fall a word of hope and love,
          Unstudied from the heart,--
        A whisper on the tumult thrown,
          A transitory breath,--
        It raised a brother from the dust,
          It saved a soul from death.
        O germ! O fount! O word of love!
          O thought at random cast!
        Ye were but little at the first,
          But mighty at the last.

        The following poem by Mrs. Hemans (1793-1835),
        an English poet, is remembered for its historic
        interest. Louis Casabianca, a Frenchman,
        served on a war ship that helped convey French
        troops to America, to aid the colonists during
        the Revolution. Later, when Napoleon attempted
        to conquer Egypt, he was captain of the
        admiral's flagship during the battle of the
        Nile. When the admiral was killed, he took
        command of the fleet at the moment of defeat.
        He blew up his ship, after the crew had been
        saved, rather than surrender it. His
        ten-year-old son refused to leave and perished
        with his father.


CASABIANCA

FELICIA DOROTHEA HEMANS

        The boy stood on the burning deck,
          Whence all but him had fled;
        The flame that lit the battle's wreck
          Shone round him o'er the dead.

        Yet beautiful and bright he stood,
          As born to rule the storm;
        A creature of heroic blood,
          A proud, though child-like form.

        The flames rolled on; he would not go
          Without his father's word;
        That father, faint in death below,
          His voice no longer heard.

        He called aloud, "Say, father, say,
          If yet my task be done!"
        He knew not that the chieftain lay
          Unconscious of his son.

        "Speak, father!" once again he cried,
          "If I may yet be gone!"
        And but the booming shots replied,
          And fast the flames rolled on.

        Upon his brow he felt their breath,
          And in his waving hair,
        And looked from that lone post of death
          In still, yet brave despair.

        And shouted but once more aloud,
          "My father! must I stay?"
        While o'er him, fast, through sail and shroud,
          The wreathing fires made way.

        They wrapt the ship in splendor wild,
          They caught the flag on high,
        And streamed above the gallant child,
          Like banners in the sky.

        There came a burst of thunder sound:
          The boy,--oh! where was he?
        Ask of the winds, that far around
          With fragments strewed the sea,--

        With mast, and helm, and pennon fair,
          That well had borne their part,--
        But the noblest thing that perished there,
          Was that young, faithful heart.

        The five numbers that follow are from the works
        of the great English poet and mystic William
        Blake (1757-1827). All except the first are
        given in their entirety. No. 328 is made up of
        three couplets taken from the loosely strung
        together _Auguries of Innocence_. Nos. 329,
        330, and 332 are from _Songs of Innocence_
        (1789), where the last was printed as an
        introduction without any other title. No. 331
        is from _Songs of Experience_ (1794). Blake
        labored in obscurity and poverty, though he has
        now come to be regarded as one of England's
        most important poets. It is not necessary that
        children should understand fully all that Blake
        says, but it is important for teachers to
        realize that most children are natural mystics
        and that Blake's poetry, more than any other,
        is the natural food for them.

THREE THINGS TO REMEMBER

WILLIAM BLAKE

        A Robin Redbreast in a cage,
        Puts all heaven in a rage.

        A skylark wounded on the wing
        Doth make a cherub cease to sing.

        He who shall hurt the little wren
        Shall never be beloved by men.



329


THE LAMB

WILLIAM BLAKE

          Little lamb, who made thee?
          Dost thou know who made thee,
        Gave thee life, and bade thee feed
        By the stream and o'er the mead;
        Gave thee clothing of delight,
        Softest clothing, woolly, bright;
        Gave thee such a tender voice,
        Making all the vales rejoice?
          Little lamb, who made thee?
          Dost thou know who made thee?

          Little lamb, I'll tell thee,
          Little lamb, I'll tell thee.
        He is called by thy name,
        For He calls himself a Lamb:
        He is meek and he is mild,
        He became a little child.
        I a child and thou a lamb,
        We are called by His name.
          Little lamb, God bless thee,
          Little lamb, God bless thee.

THE SHEPHERD

WILLIAM BLAKE

        How sweet is the shepherd's sweet lot;
        From the morn to the evening he strays;
        He shall follow his sheep all the day,
        And his tongue shall be filled with praise.

        For he hears the lambs' innocent call,
        And he hears the ewes' tender reply;
        He is watchful while they are in peace,
        For they know when their shepherd is nigh.



331


THE TIGER

WILLIAM BLAKE

        Tiger, tiger, burning bright
        In the forests of the night,
        What immortal hand or eye
        Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

        In what distant deeps or skies
        Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
        On what wings dare he aspire?
        What the hand dare seize thy fire?

        And what shoulder and what art
        Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
        And when thy heart began to beat,
        What dread hand formed thy dread feet?

        What the hammer? what the chain?
        In what furnace was thy brain?
        What the anvil? what dread grasp
        Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

        When the stars threw down their spears,
        And water'd heaven with their tears,
        Did He smile His work to see?
        Did He who made the lamb make thee?

        Tiger, tiger, burning bright
        In the forests of the night,
        What immortal hand or eye
        Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

THE PIPER

WILLIAM BLAKE

        Piping down the valleys wild,
        Piping songs of pleasant glee,
        On a cloud I saw a child,
        And he laughing said to me:--

        "Pipe a song about a lamb":
        So I piped with merry cheer.
        "Piper, pipe that song again":
        So I piped; he wept to hear.

        "Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe,
        Sing thy songs of happy cheer":
        So I sung the same again,
        While he wept with joy to hear.

        "Piper, sit thee down and write
        In a book that all may read."
        So he vanish'd from my sight;
        And I pluck'd a hollow reed,

        And I made a rural pen,
        And I stain'd the water clear,
        And I wrote my happy songs
        Every child may joy to hear.

        Eliza Cook (1818-1889) was an English poet who
        had quite a vogue in her day, and whose poem
        "Try Again" deals with one of those incidents
        held in affectionate remembrance by youth.
        Bruce and the spider may be less historically
        true, but it seems destined to eternal life
        alongside Leonidas and his Spartans. Older
        readers may remember Miss Cook's "My Old Arm
        Chair," which is usually given the place of
        honor as her most popular poem.


TRY AGAIN

ELIZA COOK

        King Bruce of Scotland flung himself down
          In a lonely mood to think:
        'Tis true he was monarch, and wore a crown,
          But his heart was beginning to sink.

        For he had been trying to do a great deed,
          To make his people glad;
        He had tried and tried, but couldn't succeed;
          And so he became quite sad.

        He flung himself down in low despair,
          As grieved as man could be;
        And after a while as he pondered there,
          "I'll give it all up," said he.

        Now, just at the moment, a spider dropped,
          With its silken, filmy clue;
        And the King, in the midst of his thinking, stopped
          To see what the spider would do.

        'Twas a long way up to the ceiling dome,
          And it hung by a rope so fine,
        That how it would get to its cobweb home
          King Bruce could not divine.

        It soon began to cling and crawl
          Straight up, with strong endeavor;
        But down it came with a slippery sprawl,
          As near to the ground as ever.

        Up, up it ran, not a second to stay,
          To utter the least complaint,
        Till it fell still lower, and there it lay,
          A little dizzy and faint.

        Its head grew steady--again it went,
          And traveled a half yard higher;
        'Twas a delicate thread it had to tread,
          And a road where its feet would tire.

        Again it fell and swung below,
          But again it quickly mounted;
        Till up and down, now fast, now slow,
          Nine brave attempts were counted.

        "Sure," cried the King, "that foolish thing
          Will strive no more to climb;
        When it toils so hard to reach and cling,
          And tumbles every time."

        But up the insect went once more;
          Ah me! 'tis an anxious minute;
        He's only a foot from his cobweb door.
          Oh, say, will he lose or win it?

        Steadily, steadily, inch by inch,
          Higher and higher he got;
        And a bold little run at the very last pinch
          Put him into his native cot.

        "Bravo, bravo!" the King cried out;
          "All honor to those who _try_;
        The spider up there, defied despair;
          He conquered, and why shouldn't I?"

        And Bruce of Scotland braced his mind,
          And gossips tell the tale,
        That he tried once more as he tried before,
          And that time did not fail.

        Pay goodly heed, all ye who read,
          And beware of saying, "I _can't_";
        'Tis a cowardly word, and apt to lead
          To idleness, folly, and want.

        Whenever you find your heart despair
          Of doing some goodly thing,
        Con over this strain, try bravely again,
          And remember the spider and King!

        Nonsense verse seems to have its special place
        in the economy of life as a sort of balance to
        the over-serious tendency. One of the two great
        masters of verse of this sort was the English
        author Edward Lear (1812-1888). He was also a
        famous illustrator of books and magazines.
        Among his juvenile books, illustrated by
        himself, were _Nonsense Songs_ and _More
        Nonsense Songs_. All his verse is now generally
        published under the first title. Good nonsense
        verse precludes explanation, the mind of the
        hearer being too busy with the delightfully odd
        combinations to figure on how they happened.


THE OWL AND THE PUSSY-CAT

EDWARD LEAR

        The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea
          In a beautiful pea-green boat:
        They took some honey, and plenty of money
          Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
        The Owl looked up to the stars above,
          And sang to a small guitar,
        "O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,
          What a beautiful Pussy you are,
              You are,
              You are!
          What a beautiful Pussy you are!"

        Pussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl,
          How charmingly sweet you sing!
        Oh! let us be married; too long we have tarried:
          But what shall we do for a ring?"
        They sailed away, for a year and a day,
          To the land where the bong-tree grows;
        And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood,
          With a ring at the end of his nose,
              His nose,
              His nose,
          With a ring at the end of his nose.

        "Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling
          Your ring?" Said the Piggy, "I will."
        So they took it away, and were married next day
          By the Turkey who lives on the hill.
        They dined on mince, and slices of quince,
          Which they ate with a runcible spoon;
        And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,
          They danced by the light of the moon,
              The moon,
              The moon,
          They danced by the light of the moon.

THE TABLE AND THE CHAIR

EDWARD LEAR

        Said the Table to the Chair,
        "You can hardly be aware
        How I suffer from the heat
        And from chilblains on my feet.
        If we took a little walk,
        We might have a little talk;
        Pray let us take the air,"
        Said the Table to the Chair.

        Said the Chair unto the Table,
        "Now, you _know_ we are not able:
        How foolishly you talk,
        When you know we _cannot_ walk!"
        Said the Table with a sigh,
        "It can do no harm to try.
        I've as many legs as you:
        Why can't we walk on two?"

        So they both went slowly down,
        And walked about the town
        With a cheerful bumpy sound
        As they toddled round and round;
        And everybody cried,
        As they hastened to their side,
        "See! the Table and the Chair
        Have come out to take the air!"

        But in going down an alley,
        To a castle in a valley,
        They completely lost their way,
        And wandered all the day;
        Till, to see them safely back,
        They paid a Ducky-quack,
        And a Beetle, and a Mouse,
        Who took them to their house.

        Then they whispered to each other,
        "O delightful little brother,
        What a lovely walk we've taken!
        Let us dine on beans and bacon."
        So the Ducky and the leetle
        Browny-mousy and the Beetle
        Dined, and danced upon their heads
        Till they toddled to their beds.

THE POBBLE WHO HAS NO TOES

EDWARD LEAR

        The Pobble who has no toes
          Had once as many as we;
        When they said, "Some day you may lose them all";
          He replied--"Fish fiddle-de-dee!"
        And his Aunt Jobiska made him drink
        Lavender water tinged with pink,
        For she said, "The world in general knows
        There's nothing so good for a Pobble's toes!"

        The Pobble who has no toes
          Swam across the Bristol Channel;
        But before he set out he wrapped his nose
          In a piece of scarlet flannel.
        For his Aunt Jobiska said, "No harm
        Can come to his toes if his nose is warm;
        And it's perfectly known that a Pobble's toes
        Are safe--provided he minds his nose."

        The Pobble swam fast and well,
          And when boats or ships came near him
        He tinkledy-binkledy-winkled a bell,
          So that all the world could hear him.
        And all the Sailors and Admirals cried,
        When they saw him nearing the farther side,--
        "He has gone to fish for his Aunt Jobiska's
        Runcible Cat with crimson whiskers!"

        But before he touched the shore,
          The shore of the Bristol Channel,
        A sea-green Porpoise carried away
          His wrapper of scarlet flannel.
        And when he came to observe his feet,
        Formerly garnished with toes so neat,
        His face at once became forlorn
        On perceiving that all his toes were gone!

        And nobody ever knew,
          From that dark day to the present,
        Whoso had taken the Pobble's toes,
          In a manner so far from pleasant.
        Whether the shrimps or crawfish gray,
        Or crafty Mermaids stole them away--
        Nobody knew; and nobody knows
        How the Pobble was robbed of his twice five toes!

        The Pobble who has no toes
          Was placed in a friendly Bark,
        And they rowed him back, and carried him up
          To his Aunt Jobiska's Park.
        And she made him a feast at his earnest wish
        Of eggs and buttercups fried with fish;--
        And she said,--"It's a fact the whole world knows,
        That Pobbles are happier without their toes."

        The two great classics among modern nonsense
        books are Lewis Carroll's _Alice in Wonderland_
        and _Through the Looking Glass_. They are in
        prose with poems interspersed. "The Walrus and
        the Carpenter," is from _Through the Looking
        Glass_, while "A Strange Wild Song," is from
        _Sylvie and Bruno_. This latter book never
        achieved the success of its forerunners, though
        it has some delightful passages, as in the case
        of the poem given. Lewis Carroll was the
        pseudonym of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson
        (1832-1898), an English mathematician at Oxford
        University.


THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER

"LEWIS CARROLL"

        The sun was shining on the sea,
          Shining with all his might:
        He did his very best to make
          The billows smooth and bright--
        And this was odd, because it was
          The middle of the night.

        The moon was shining sulkily,
          Because she thought the sun
        Had got no business to be there
          After the day was done--
        "It's very rude of him," she said,
          "To come and spoil the fun!"

        The sea was wet as wet could be.
          The sands were dry as dry.
        You could not see a cloud, because
          No cloud was in the sky;
        No birds were flying overhead--
          There were no birds to fly.

        The Walrus and the Carpenter
          Were walking close at hand;
        They wept like anything to see
          Such quantities of sand:
        "If this were only cleared away,"
          They said, "it would be grand!"

        "If seven maids with seven mops
          Swept it for half a year,
        Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
          "That they could get it clear?"
        "I doubt it," said the Carpenter,
          And shed a bitter tear.

        "O Oysters, come and walk with us!"
          The Walrus did beseech.
        "A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
          Along the briny beach:
        We cannot do with more than four,
          To give a hand to each."

        The eldest Oyster looked at him,
          But never a word he said:
        The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
          And shook his heavy head--
        Meaning to say he did not choose
          To leave the oyster-bed.

        But four young Oysters hurried up,
          All eager for the treat:
        Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
          Their shoes were clean and neat--
        And this was odd, because, you know,
          They hadn't any feet.

        Four other Oysters followed them,
          And yet another four;
        And thick and fast they came at last,
          And more, and more, and more--
        All hopping through the frothy waves,
          And scrambling to the shore.

        The Walrus and the Carpenter
          Walked on a mile or so,
        And then they rested on a rock
          Conveniently low:
        And all the little Oysters stood
          And waited in a row.

        "The time has come," the Walrus said,
          "To talk of many things:
        Of shoes--and ships--and sealing wax
          Of cabbages--and kings--
        And why the sea is boiling hot--
          And whether pigs have wings."

        "But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
          "Before we have our chat;
        For some of us are out of breath,
          And all of us are fat!"
        "No hurry!" said the Carpenter.
          They thanked him much for that.

        "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
          "Is what we chiefly need:
        Pepper and vinegar besides
          Are very good indeed--
        Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,
          We can begin to feed."

        "But not on us!" the Oysters cried,
          Turning a little blue.
        "After such kindness, that would be
          A dismal thing to do!"
        "The night is fine," the Walrus said.
          "Do you admire the view?

        "It was so kind of you to come!
          And you are very nice!"
        The Carpenter said nothing but
          "Cut me another slice:
        I wish you were not quite so deaf--
          I've had to ask you twice!"

        "It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
          "To play them such a trick,
        After we've brought them out so far,
          And made them trot so quick!"
        The Carpenter said nothing but
          "The butter's spread too thick!"

        "I weep for you," the Walrus said:
          "I deeply sympathize."
        With sobs and tears he sorted out
          Those of the largest size,
        Holding his pocket handkerchief
          Before his streaming eyes.

        "O Oysters," cried the Carpenter,
          "You've had a pleasant run!
        Shall we be trotting home again?"
          But answer came there none--
        And this was scarcely odd, because
          They'd eaten every one.

A STRANGE WILD SONG

"LEWIS CARROLL"

        He thought he saw a Buffalo
          Upon the chimney-piece:
        He looked again, and found it was
          His Sister's Husband's Niece.
        "Unless you leave this house," he said,
          "I'll send for the Police."

        He thought he saw a Rattlesnake
          That questioned him in Greek:
        He looked again, and found it was
          The Middle of Next Week.
        "The one thing I regret," he said,
          "Is that it cannot speak!"

        He thought he saw a Banker's Clerk
          Descending from the 'bus:
        He looked again, and found it was
          A Hippopotamus.
        "If this should stay to dine," he said,
          "There won't be much for us!"

        He thought he saw a Kangaroo
          That worked a coffee-mill;
        He looked again, and found it was
          A Vegetable-Pill.
        "Were I to swallow this," he said,
          "I should be very ill."

        He thought he saw a Coach and Four
          That stood beside his bed:
        He looked again, and found it was
          A Bear without a Head.
        "Poor thing," he said, "poor silly thing!
          It's waiting to be fed!"

        He thought he saw an Albatross
          That fluttered round the Lamp:
        He looked again, and found it was
          A Penny Postage-Stamp.
