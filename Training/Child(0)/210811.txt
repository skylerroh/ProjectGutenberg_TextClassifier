DEFINITIONS


LANGUAGE is the expression of thought by means of words.

WORDS, with respect to their _origin_, are divided into _primitive_
and _derivative_; and with respect to their _composition_, into _simple_
and _compound_.

A PRIMITIVE word is one that is not derived from another word.

A DERIVATIVE word is one that is formed from another word by means
of prefixes or suffixes, or by some other change.

A SIMPLE word is one that consists of a single significant term.

A COMPOUND word is one made up of two or more simple words.

A SENTENCE is a combination of words which make complete sense.

A SYLLABLE is a word or a part of a word pronounced by one effort
of the voice.


The DIAERESIS is the mark [..] placed over the second of two
adjacent vowels, to denote that they are to be pronounced as distinct
letters; as _REECHO_.



RULES FOR THE USE OF CAPITAL LETTERS


The first word of every SENTENCE should begin with a capital.

PROPER NAMES, and words derived from them, should begin with
capitals.

The first word of every LINE OF POETRY should begin with a capital.

All names of God and all titles of the DEITY, as well as all
pronouns referring to the Deity, should begin with capitals.

The words I and O should always be capitals.

The first word of a DIRECT QUOTATION should begin with a capital.

The names of the DAYS and of the MONTHS should begin with
capitals; but not the names of the seasons.

COLUMBUS AT THE CONVENT.


       Dreary and brown the night comes down,
         Gloomy, without a star.
       On Palos town the night comes down;
       The day departs with stormy frown;
         The sad sea moans afar.

       A convent gate is near; 'tis late;
         Tin-gling! the bell they ring.
       They ring the bell, they ask for bread--
       "Just for my child," the father said.
         Kind hands the bread will bring.

       White was his hair, his mien was fair,
         His look was calm and great.
       The porter ran and called a friar;
       The friar made haste and told the prior;
         The prior came to the gate.

       He took them in, he gave them food;
         The traveler's dreams he heard;
       And fast the midnight moments flew.
       And fast the good man's wonder grew,
         And all his heart was stirred.

       The child the while, with soft, sweet smile,
         Forgetful of all sorrow,
       Lay soundly sleeping in his bed.
       The good man kissed him there, and said:
         "You leave us not to-morrow!

       "I pray you, rest the convent's guest;
         This child shall be our own--
       A precious care, while you prepare
       Your business with the court, and bear
         Your message to the throne."

       And so his guest he comforted.
         O wise, good prior! to you,
       Who cheered the stranger's darkest days,
       And helped him on his way, what praise
         And gratitude are due!

THE LITTLE FERN.


A great many centuries ago, when the earth was even more beautiful than
it is now, there grew in one of the many valleys a dainty little fern
leaf. All around the tiny plant were many others, but none of them so
graceful and delicate as this one I tell you of. Every day the cheery
breezes sought out their playmate, and the merry sunbeams darted in and
out, playing hide-and-seek among reeds and rushes; and when the twilight
shadows deepened, and the sunbeams had all gone away, the little fern
curled itself up for the night with only the dewdrops for company.

So day after day went by: and no one knew of, or found the sweet wild
fern, or the beautiful valley it grew in. But--for this was a very long
time ago--a great change took place in the earth; and rocks and soil
were upturned, and the rivers found new channels to flow in.

Now, when all this happened, the little fern was quite covered up with
the soft moist clay, and perhaps you think it might as well never have
lived as to have been hidden away where none could see it.

But after all, it was not really lost; for hundreds of years afterwards,
when all that clay had become stone, and had broken into many fragments,
a very wise and learned man found the bit of rock upon which was all the
delicate tracery of the little fern leaf, with outline just as perfect
and lovely as when, long, long ago it had swayed to the breezes in its
own beautiful valley.

And so wonderful did it seem to the wise man, that he took the fern leaf
home with him and placed it in his cabinet where all could admire it;
and where, if they were thoughtful and clever enough, they could think
out the story for themselves and find the lesson which was hidden away
with the fern in the bit of rock.

Lesson! did I say? Well, let's not call it a lesson, but only a truth
which it will do every one of us good to remember; and that is, that
none of the beauty in this fair world around us, nor anything that is
sweet and lovely in our own hearts, and lives, will ever be useless and
lost. For, as the little fern leaf lay hidden away for years and years,
and yet finally was found by the wise man and given a place with his
other rare and precious possessions where it could still, though
silently, aid those who looked upon it; so we, as boys and girls, men
and women who are to be, can now, day by day, cultivate all lovely
traits of character, making ourselves ready to take our place in the
world's work. And when that time comes we shall not only be able to aid
others silently, as did the little fern, but may also, by word and deed,
lend a hand to each and every one around us.
