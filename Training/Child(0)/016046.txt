~PREFACE~


This is a book of short stories for the youngest readers,--stories
about old friends, which they can easily read themselves.

Here they will learn why Mary's Lamb went to school, what the mouse was
looking for when he ran up the clock, why one little pig went to
market, how one little pig got lost, and the answers to a great many
other puzzling questions.

The stories are written around some of the Mother Goose rhymes because
the children love to meet old friends in books just as well as we do.

The vocabulary is limited to words easily recognized by beginners in
reading, and the sentences are made short and direct, so that they will
be understood. The stories progress gradually from very easy to more
difficult matter, keeping pace with the child's increasing knowledge
and ability,--the book being carefully arranged for use as a
supplementary reader, or for home reading for the little ones.

  Little Boy Blue, come blow your horn,
    The sheep's in the meadow,
    The cow's in the corn.
  Where's the little boy who looks after the sheep?
    He's under the haycock, fast asleep.

LITTLE BOY BLUE


Little Boy Blue was not his real name.

Oh, no! His real name was Richard Snow.

But his mother always called him "Little Boy Blue."

His father called him "Boy Blue," too.

Every one called him "Little Boy Blue," and so I will.

Boy Blue's eyes were as blue as the sky on a summer day.

When he was a baby he always wore a blue ribbon in his hair.

When he was five years old he wore a blue blouse and a blue cap.

Now he wears a blue suit and a blue tie.

For Boy Blue is seven years old now, and is a big boy, you see.

Boy Blue lives on a large farm in the country.

There are horses, and cows, and sheep, and pigs, and ducks, and hens
and chickens on the farm.

Of course, Boy Blue likes the cows and sheep best.

He likes to drive the cows to the pasture in the morning.

Sometimes, at night, he drives them home again.

He likes to watch his father milk the cows and feed them.

"When I am a big boy," he says, "I shall milk my own cow every day."

Sometimes he goes with the boy to watch the sheep.

Shep, the dog, always goes with them. He watches the sheep all day
long.

They like to get into the meadow where the grass is green and sweet.

But Shep drives them out every time.

Boy Blue and Shep play together in the fields. They run and jump and
chase each other.

Boy Blue hides, and Shep finds him. "Bow-wow!" Shep says. "Here you
are! Now for a frolic."

And off they go again.

Boy Blue likes to feed the chickens.

He likes to drive the ducks down to the brook and watch them swim about
in the water.

Sometimes he helps his mother take care of Little Sister.

Then she calls him her "Little Helper."

"No," he says, "I am your Big Boy Blue."




SNOWBALL


One morning Boy Blue had tears in his big blue eyes.

He could not find his Snowball.

You will laugh when I tell you who Snowball was.

She was not hard and cold.

She was soft and warm.

Snowball was a pretty, white hen.

She was Boy Blue's very own, and she would follow him all over the
yard.

She would eat grain from his hand, and let him smooth her white
feathers.

But now Boy Blue could not find her.

He had looked in the hen-house and all over the yard.

"Have you looked in the barn?" asked his mother.

"Oh, no!" said Boy Blue, "and I saw her coming out of the barn
yesterday."

"So did I," said his mother. "I think you will find her in the hay."

Boy Blue climbed up on the hay.

There in a corner he found his Snowball.

When she saw her little friend, she began to scold.

"Why, Snowball, what are you doing here?" said Boy Blue.

"Cluck, cluck," said Snowball. "Do not come too near."

"I have some eggs in this nice warm nest.

"Soon I shall have some little chickens for you.

"Oh, oh!" cried Boy Blue, "I must tell Mamma."

"You must feed Snowball," said his mother.

"Give her some corn and a drink of water."

Boy Blue took very good care of his pretty, white Snowball.

He gave her corn and fresh water every morning.

Three weeks seemed to him a long time to wait.

But Snowball did not seem to think so.

One morning Boy Blue went out to feed her, and she would not leave her
nest.

"Cluck, cluck!" said she, "I can hear my little chickens."

Boy Blue kept very still and listened.

"Peep, peep, peep," he heard.

"Yes, Snowball," he said, "I can hear your chickens, too."

All day he was busy helping John build a chicken house.

They built the house in the field near the barn.
