  Might aid and not impede her course.

  In the ship-yard stood the Master,
  With the model of the vessel,
  That should laugh at all disaster,
  And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!

  Covering many a rood of ground,
  Lay the timber piled around;
  Timber of chestnut, and elm, and oak,
  And scattered here and there, with these,
  The knarred and crooked cedar knees;
  Brought from regions far away,
  From Pascagoula's sunny bay,
  And the banks of the roaring Roanoke!
  Ah! what a wondrous thing it is
  To note how many wheels of toil
  One thought, one word, can set in motion!
  There's not a ship that sails the ocean,
  But every climate, every soil,
  Must bring its tribute, great or small,
  And help to build the wooden wall!

  The sun was rising o'er the sea,
  And long the level shadows lay,
  As if they, too, the beams would be
  Of some great, airy argosy,
  Framed and launched in a single day.
  That silent architect, the sun,
  Had hewn and laid them every one,
  Ere the work of man was yet begun.
  Beside the Master, when he spoke,
  A youth, against an anchor leaning,
  Listened, to catch his slightest meaning.
  Only the long waves, as they broke
  In ripples on the pebbly beach,
  Interrupted the old man's speech.

  Beautiful they were, in sooth,
  The old man and the fiery youth!
  The old man, in whose busy brain
  Many a ship that sailed the main
  Was modelled o'er and o'er again;--
  The fiery youth, who was to be
  The heir of his dexterity,
  The heir of his house, and his daughter's hand,
  When he had built and launched from land
  What the elder head had planned.

  "Thus," said he, "will we build this ship!
  Lay square the blocks upon the slip,
  And follow well this plan of mine.
  Choose the timbers with greatest care;
  Of all that is unsound beware;
  For only what is sound and strong
  To this vessel shall belong.
  Cedar of Maine and Georgia pine
  Here together shall combine.
  A goodly frame, and a goodly fame,
  And the UNION be her name!
  For the day that gives her to the sea
  Shall give my daughter unto thee!"

  The Master's word
  Enraptured the young man heard;
  And as he turned his face aside,
  With a look of joy and a thrill of pride,
  Standing before
  Her father's door,
  He saw the form of his promised bride.
  The sun shone on her golden hair,
  And her cheek was glowing fresh and fair,
  With the breath of morn and the soft sea air.
  Like a beauteous barge was she,
  Still at rest on the sandy beach,
  Just beyond the billow's reach;
  But he
  Was the restless, seething, stormy sea!

  Ah, how skilful grows the hand
  That obeyeth Love's command!
  It is the heart, and not the brain,
  That to the highest doth attain,
  And he who followeth Love's behest
  Far excelleth all the rest!
  Thus with the rising of the sun
  Was the noble task begun,
  And soon throughout the ship-yard's bounds
  Were heard the intermingled sounds
  Of axes and of mallets, plied
  With vigorous arms on every side;
  Plied so deftly and so well,
  That, ere the shadows of evening fell,
  The keel of oak for a noble ship,
  Scarfed and bolted, straight and strong,
  Was lying ready, and stretched along
  The blocks, well placed upon the slip.
  Happy, thrice happy, every one
  Who sees his labor well begun,
  And not perplexed and multiplied,
  By idly waiting for time and tide!

  And when the hot, long day was o'er,
  The young man at the Master's door
  Sat with the maiden calm and still,
  And within the porch, a little more
  Removed beyond the evening chill,
  The father sat, and told them tales
  Of wrecks in the great September gales,
  Of pirates coasting the Spanish Main,
  And ships that never came back again,
  The chance and change of a sailor's life,
  Want and plenty, rest and strife,
  His roving fancy, like the wind,
  That nothing can stay and nothing can bind,
  And the magic charm of foreign lands,
  With shadows of palms, and shining sands,
  Where the tumbling surf,
  O'er the coral reefs of Madagascar,
  Washes the feet of the swarthy Lascar,
  As he lies alone and asleep on the turf.
  And the trembling maiden held her breath
  At the tales of that awful, pitiless sea,
  With all its terror and mystery,
  The dim, dark sea, so like unto Death,
  That divides and yet unites mankind!
  And whenever the old man paused, a gleam
  From the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume
  The silent group in the twilight gloom,
  And thoughtful faces, as in a dream;
  And for a moment one might mark
  What had been hidden by the dark,
  That the head of the maiden lay at rest,
  Tenderly, on the young man's breast!

  Day by day the vessel grew,
  With timbers fashioned strong and true,
  Stemson and keelson and sternson-knee,
  Till, framed with perfect symmetry,
  A skeleton ship rose up to view!
  And around the bows and along the side
  The heavy hammers and mallets plied,
  Till after many a week, at length,
  Wonderful for form and strength,
  Sublime in its enormous bulk,
  Loomed aloft the shadowy hulk!
  And around it columns of smoke, upwreathing,
  Rose from the boiling, bubbling, seething
  Caldron, that glowed,
  And overflowed
  With the black tar, heated for the sheathing.
  And amid the clamors
  Of clattering hammers,
  He who listened heard now and then
  The song of the Master and his men:--

  "Build me straight, O worthy Master,
    Stanch and strong, a goodly vessel,
  That shall laugh at all disaster,
    And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!"

  With oaken brace and copper band,
  Lay the rudder on the sand,
  That, like a thought, should have control
  Over the movement of the whole;
  And near it the anchor, whose giant hand
  Would reach down and grapple with the land,
  And immovable and fast
  Hold the great ship against the bellowing blast!
  And at the bows an image stood,
  By a cunning artist carved in wood,
  With robes of white, that far behind
  Seemed to be fluttering in the wind.
  It was not shaped in a classic mould,
  Not like a Nymph or Goddess of old,
  Or Naiad rising from the water,
  But modelled from the Master's daughter!
  On many a dreary and misty night,
  'T will be seen by the rays of the signal light,
  Speeding along through the rain and the dark,
  Like a ghost in its snow-white sark,
  The pilot of some phantom bark,
  Guiding the vessel, in its flight,
  By a path none other knows aright!

  Behold, at last,
  Each tall and tapering mast
  Is swung into its place;
  Shrouds and stays
  Holding it firm and fast!

  Long ago,
  In the deer-haunted forests of Maine,
  When upon mountain and plain
  Lay the snow,
  They fell,--those lordly pines!
  Those grand, majestic pines!
  'Mid shouts and cheers
  The jaded steers,
  Panting beneath the goad,
  Dragged down the weary, winding road
  Those captive kings so straight and tall,
  To be shorn of their streaming hair,
  And naked and bare,
  To feel the stress and the strain
  Of the wind and the reeling main,
  Whose roar
  Would remind them forevermore
  Of their native forests they should not see again.

  And everywhere
  The slender, graceful spars
  Poise aloft in the air,
  And at the mast-head,
  White, blue, and red,
  A flag unrolls the stripes and stars.
  Ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless,
  In foreign harbors shall behold
  That flag unrolled,
  'T will be as a friendly hand
  Stretched out from his native land,
  Filling his heart with memories sweet and endless!

  All is finished! and at length
  Has come the bridal day
  Of beauty and of strength.
  To-day the vessel shall be launched!
  With fleecy clouds the sky is blanched,
  And o'er the bay,
  Slowly, in all its splendors dight,
  The great sun rises to behold the sight.

  The ocean old,
  Centuries old,
  Strong as youth, and as uncontrolled,
  Paces restless to and fro,
  Up and down the sands of gold.
  His beating heart is not at rest;
  And far and wide,
  With ceaseless flow,
  His beard of snow
  Heaves with the heaving of his breast.
  He waits impatient for his bride.
  There she stands,
  With her foot upon the sands,
  Decked with flags and streamers gay,
  In honor of her marriage day,
  Her snow-white signals fluttering, blending,
  Round her like a veil descending,
  Ready to be
  The bride of the gray old sea.

  On the deck another bride
  Is standing by her lover's side.
  Shadows from the flags and shrouds,
  Like the shadows cast by clouds,
  Broken by many a sudden fleck,
  Fall around them on the deck.
