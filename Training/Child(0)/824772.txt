Mr. Lanier's books, in which he presents to boy readers the old English
classics of history and legend in such attractive form, are now issued
in four uniform volumes, well made and well illustrated. While they are
stories of action and stirring incident, which make them extremely
exciting, they teach those lessons which manly, honest boys ought to
learn. The oath of the young fourteenth century knight made him vow to
speak the truth, to perform a promise to the utmost, to reverence all
women to maintain right and honesty, to help the weak, to treat high and
low with courtesy, to be fair to a bitter foe, and to pursue simplicity,
modesty and gentleness of heart and bearing; and the nineteenth century
knight is he who takes the same oath of fidelity to truth, honesty and
purity of heart. The illustrations are full of fire and spirit, and add
very much to one's enjoyment of the book.

"Amid all the strange and fanciful scenery of these stories, character
and the ideals of character remain at the simplest and purest. The
romantic history transpires in the healthy atmosphere of the open air on
the green earth beneath the open sky. * * * The figures of Right, Truth,
Justice, Honor, Purity, Courage, Reverence for Law, are always in the
background; and the grand passion inspired by the book is for strength
to do well and nobly in the world."

               STANLEY'S GREAT AFRICAN STORY FOR BOYS.

                              MY KALULU.

         _PRINCE, KING AND SLAVE. A STORY OF CENTRAL AFRICA._

                         BY HENRY M. STANLEY.

   _One volume, 12mo, New Edition, with many Illustrations,  $1.50_

Mr. Stanley's African romance for boys is based upon knowledge acquired
during his journey in search of Dr. Livingstone, which began in 1871 and
ended in 1872. It is a fascinating story of strange scenes, incidents
and adventures among the tribes of Central Africa, and of encounters
with the wild animals that make their home there. One feature of the
book is its vivid description of the evils of the slave trade. The
popularity of the story was great, and as it has been out of print, the
publishers have issued a new and cheaper edition, which will no doubt
meet with the same hearty reception accorded to the first.

in this volume to delight him all winter, and he will be hard to please
who is not charmed by its graphic pages."

            _One volume, royal 8vo, half leather,  $2.00_

"The scene of the story is mediaeval Germany in the time of feuds and
robber barons and romance. The kidnapping of Otto, his adventures among
rough soldiers, and his daring rescue, make up a spirited and thrilling
story. The drawings are in keeping with the text, and in mechanical and
artistic qualities as well as in literary execution the book must be
greeted as one of the very best juveniles of the year, quite worthy to
succeed to the remarkable popularity of Mr. Pyle's 'Robin Hood.'"

The narrative of how the indomitable pluck and perseverance of Ingomar
Vang, the young Norwegian inventor and whaler, enabled him to triumph
against heavy odds will stir the blood in every boy's veins. The tragic
fate of Prebensen, the rich, cruel and selfish oppressor of everyone in
the little northern whaling village, is pictured with much dramatic
force. A healthy, honest, manly tone pervades this story of a young
man's trials and final successes. The illustrations are in Mr. Taylor's
best style, full of character and color, and faultlessly drawn.

"About Professor Boyesen's writings there is a freshness which, while it
retains the Norse flavor of Andersen, is modern rather than antiquely
quaint. One readily recognizes the fact that the author is a Norseman
reciting in English the tales and legends of his land, and not
addressing the children of his own country in their own language. Every
page is full of vigor and spirit. The boys and girls are not myths, but
are full of life and action. While the stories are addressed to the
young, their character is such that older people will not fail to be
interested in them."

"It would be difficult to find a more delightful collection of fairy

Stories' will pass their holidays as pleasantly and as profitably as
Rigi passed his. The book is illustrated with twenty-four fascinating

"When the little boy, for whose benefit the various articles of
bric-a-brac in his father's drawing room relate stories appropriate to
their several native countries, exclaims, at the conclusion of one of
them: 'I almost think there can't be a better one than that!' the
reader, of whatever age, will probably feel inclined to agree with him.
Upon the whole, it is to be wished that every boy and girl in America,
or anywhere else, might become intimately acquainted with the contents
of this book. There is more virtue in one of these stories than in the
entire library of modern juvenile literature."

"The little ones, who so willingly go back with us to 'Jack the
Giant-Killer,' 'Bluebeard,' and the kindred stories of our childhood,
will gladly welcome Mrs. Burton Harrison's 'Old-Fashioned Fairy Tales,'
where the giant, the dwarf, the fairy, the wicked princess, the ogre,
the metamorphosed prince, and all the heroes of that line come into play
and action. As they read the stories which compose this book they will
meet with all the familiar actors of the fairy world in different scenes
indeed, and with new deeds of daring, witchcraft, or charming
benevolence, but still the same characters of the old-fashioned fairy
lore. The graceful pencil of Miss Rosina Emmet has given a pictorial
interest to the book, and the many pictures scattered through its pages
accord well with the good old-fashioned character of the tales."
