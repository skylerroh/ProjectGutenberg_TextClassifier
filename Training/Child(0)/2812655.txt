perfectly free. Then place the steel pin, on the end of the
couple, in the slot C, and fasten the

[Illustration: Wiring Diagram for One and Two Bells]

other end of the couple, by means of two machine screws, to the
support made for the couple. Increase or decrease the temperature
of the thermostat and note the results. If everything is working
all right, the end of the needle should move when the temperature
of the thermostat is changed. The amount the end of the needle
moves can be easily changed by moving the support or the couple
toward or away from the shaft supporting the needle, which changes
the position of the steel pin in the slot C. The nearer the steel
pin is to the shaft supporting the needle, the greater the
movement of the end of the needle due to a given change in
temperature.

A small piece of white cardboard can be mounted directly under the
end of the needle by means of small brass strips, that in turn can
be attached to the lower ends of the main mounting holes D, Fig.
4. A scale can be marked on this piece of cardboard by noting the
position of the needle corresponding to different temperatures as
determined by a thermometer. When this scale has been completed,
you can use the thermostat as a thermometer.

Two contacts may be mounted, one on each side of the needle, in a
manner similar to the method suggested for mounting the cardboard.
These contacts should be so constructed that the end of the needle
will slide over them with little friction, and so that their
position with respect to the end of the needle may be easily
changed.

[Illustration: Assembled Thermostat]

Both contacts must be insulated from the remainder of the
thermostat, and may or may not be connected together, depending on
how the thermostat is to be used.

It would be advisable, if possible, to have the part of the needle
that touches the contact points, as well as these points, of
platinum, as the arc that is likely to be formed will not destroy
the platinum as easily as it will the brass. A small wooden
containing case can now be made and the thermostat is complete.
There should be a large number of holes drilled in the sides, ends
and back of the case so that the air inside may be always of the
same temperature as the outside air.

In adjusting, testing, or calibrating your thermostat, make sure
that it is in the same position that it will be in when in use.

The connections of the thermostat for ringing one bell when the
temperature rises or falls to a certain value, are shown in Fig.
11. The connections of the thermostat for ringing one bell when
the temperature rises to a certain value and another bell when the
temperature falls to a certain value, are shown in Fig. 12. The
complete thermostat is shown in Fig. 13.



** A Tailless Kite [458]

The frame of a 3-ft. kite is made of two sticks, each 3 ft. long.
These are tied together so that the cross stick will be at a
distance of 15 per cent of the full length of the upright stick,
from its end, or in this case 5.4 in. The sticks may be made of
straight grained pine, 3/8 in. square, for small kites, and larger
hardwood sticks, for larger kites.

The cross stick is bent into a bow

[Illustration: Plan and Dimensions for Kite]

by tying a strong cord across from end to end. The center of the
bend should be 4-1/2 in. above the ends. The bend is shown in the
sketch. Connect all four ends or points with a cord, being careful
not to pull the bend of the cross stick down, but seeing that it
remains straight across the kite. When this is done the frame is
ready for the cover.

The cover will require 2-1/2 sheets of tissue paper, 20 by 30 in.,
which should be pasted together as the sketch indicates. Cut out
the paper, allowing 2 in. margin for lapping over the cord on the
frame. Place the frame on the cover with the convex side toward
the paper and paste the margin over the cord, allowing the paper
to bag a little to form pockets for the air to lift the kite. The
corners should be reinforced with circular pieces of paper pasted
over the ends of the sticks.

The flying cord is attached to the points A and B of the frame.
There is no cross cord. The kite will fly at right angles to the
flying cord. It is easily started flying from the ground by laying
it with the head toward the operator and pulling it up into the
wind.

** The Levitation - A Modern Stage Trick [459]

This illusion has mystified thousands of the theater-going public,
in fact, it has been the "piece de resistance" of many illusion
acts. The ordinary method of procedure is as follows: The person
who is to be suspended in the air, apparently with no
support--usually a lady--is first put in a hypnotic (?) sleep. She
is placed on a couch in the middle of the stage, and in most cases
the spotlight is brought into play. The performer then takes a
position close to the couch and with dramatic

[Illustration: Raising the Subject in Midair]

effect makes a few hypnotic passes over the subject. She then
slowly rises from the couch until she has attained a height
varying from 4 to 5 ft. above the stage, as shown in Fig. 1. The
couch is then taken a way and a hoop is passed over the floating
lady. The performer now causes the lady to float back to the couch
or board that she may have been resting on, after which the
so-called hypnotic spell is withdrawn.

In spite of the claims that the illusion owes its origin to Hindoo
magic, it is nothing more nor less than a clever mechanical
contrivance, the construction of which will be readily understood
by a glance at the accompanying illustrations.

The bottom of the couch, if one is used, contains a cradle-like
arrangement which fits the recumbent form of the lady and is
connected to a heavy sheet of plate glass by means of a rod, D,
Fig. 2, attached to one end, and running parallel to the side of
the cradle. When the glass is lifted, the body of the subject is
also raised, seemingly at the will of the performer. This is
accomplished by the aid of an assistant beneath the stage floor.
The plate of glass, E, Fig. 3, passes perpendicularly through the
stage down to a double block and tackle. The end of the cable is
attached to a drum or windlass and the plate glass held steady
with guides at the sides of the slot in the stage floor, through
which it passes. The winding up of the cable naturally forces the
plate glass and cradle up, causing the lady to rise.

Some illusionists place the lady on a board on two ordinary
trestles and cause the board to rise with the lady

[Illustration: Direction the Hoop Takes In Passing over the Board]

on it, as shown in the illustration, thus obviating the use of
heavy paraphernalia as in the cradle attachment. The cradle
attachment is also generally accompanied by a 2-in. iron bar, used
in the place of the plate glass, the performer or operator
standing at the rear of the couch to conceal the bar as it comes
from beneath the stage. However, the method illustrated is the one
generally used.

The solid hoop is passed over the body in the following manner:
Start at the end, B, Fig. 2, passing the hoop as far as C with the
hoop on the outside of the back horizontal rod. The side of the
hoop toward the audience is then turned and swung clear around
over the feet at A and entered between the rod and board on which
the lady rests. The hoop is then carried as far as it will go back
toward the end B. Then the side nearest the operator is passed
over the head of the body apparently the second time and passed
off free at the feet. Thus to the closest observer the impression
is given that the hoop has encircled the lady twice. The
illustrations give in detail the working of the illusion above the
stage floor. No set rule is used for the tackle and drum below the
floor.
