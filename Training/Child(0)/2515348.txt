BIBLE HISTORY FOR THE YOUNG.

+"THE WORD" SERIES.+

By SUSAN and ANNA WARNER, Authors of "The Wide, Wide World," "Queechy,"
&c.

_With Illustrations, Plain and Coloured. Crown 8vo. 2s. 6d. each_.


The aim of this Series of Volumes is so to set forth the Bible incidents
and course of history, with its train of actors, as to see them in the
circumstances and colouring, the light and shade, of their actual
existence.

The volumes embody, as far as possible, all the known facts, natural,
social, and historical, which are required for the illustration and
elucidation of the Bible narrative.

1. WALKS FROM EDEN: The Scripture Story from the Creation to the Death
of Abraham.

2. THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL: The Scripture Story from the Birth of Isaac to
the Death of Jacob.

3. THE KINGDOM OF JUDAH: The Scripture Story from the Death of Solomon
to the Captivity.

4. THE BROKEN WALLS OF JERUSALEM AND THE REBUILDING OF THEM. In
continuation of "The House of Israel" and "The Kingdom of Judah," and
completing the work.

5. THE STAR OUT OF JACOB: The Scripture Story Illustrating the Earlier
Portion of the Gospel Narrative.

"These five books form a most comprehensive and attractive commentary on
the Scriptures suited to the requirements of the young. More real
knowledge in true child language, and within the understanding of
children, it has never been our privilege to meet with before. We are
disposed to envy those young friends who are fortunate enough to number
them among their literary possessions, for although pre-eminently
children's books, they are yet well able to impart instruction to
children of a larger growth."--_Rock_.

"There is a pleasant freshness and reality conveyed to the old,
well-worn stories, which will make children understand the details of
Eastern life and the manners and customs of the old pastoral times. 'The
Word' Series will be a charming gift to young people."--_Athenaeum_.

"We doubt whether any one has ever told 'the old, old story' more
attractively, for children at least, than the author of 'The Wide, Wide
World.' Whatever fame she may have won by her works of fiction will be
greatly increased by her success in writing these marvellous
stories."--_Christian World_.




THE GOLDEN LADDER SERIES.


_With Illustrations. Handsomely bound in cloth, gilt edges. Crown 8vo.
3s. 6d. each_.

"Children welcome with glee the volumes comprised in Nisbet's 'Golden
Ladder Series,' for they are full of interest, even though they are
stories with a moral, which is always a high-toned one."--_Liverpool
Courier_.

"'The Golden Ladder Series' of story-books, so much appreciated for
their excellence. They can be all safely recommended to the notice of
teachers as being especially suitable as rewards, while no school
library can be said to be complete without a selection from
them."--_Schoolmaster_.
