TO ALISON CUNNINGHAM

FROM HER BOY

    _For the long nights you lay awake_
    _And watched for my unworthy sake:_
    _For your most comfortable hand_
    _That led me through the uneven land:_
    _For all the story-books you read:_
    _For all the pains you comforted:_

    _For all you pitied, all you bore,_
    _In sad and happy days of yore:--_
    _My second Mother, my first Wife,_
    _The angel of my infant life--_
    _From the sick child, now well and old,_
    _Take, nurse, the little book you hold!_

    _And grant it, Heaven, that all who read_
    _May find as dear a nurse at need,_
    _And every child who lists my rhyme,_
    _In the bright, fireside, nursery clime,_
    _May hear it in as kind a voice_
    _As made my childish days rejoice!_

_R. L. S._
