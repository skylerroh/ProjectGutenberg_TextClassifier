orifice of the nostrils, it was concluded that the bird was directed
to its food by smell." There is one very interesting point in the
natural history of the woodcock which I must not forget to mention.
The old birds sometimes carry their little ones from the place where
they are hatched down to soft marshy places to feed on the worms and
insect larvae found there; they take them in the evening and return
with them in the morning. "But how do they carry them?" asked May.
Some observers have said they are carried in the claws, but Mr. St.
John maintains that the little birds are clasped tightly between the
thighs.

"Is it not a difficult thing to tell the difference between the male
and female woodcock?" asked Willy. Yes, I do not think it is possible
in every case to tell the difference; the male bird is smaller than
the female of the same age, and there are slight differences in the
colour of the plumage, but as you may meet with birds of different
ages, and as woodcocks are much subject to variation of plumage, it is
difficult to pronounce whether this woodcock is a male and that a
female.

"Oh, papa, what are these ring-marks on the end of this bit of timber
upon which we are sitting?" said Willy. These rings or zones represent
the various growths made every year by the tree when it was growing,
each zone being the produce of one year. As the wood ceases to grow
for some months in the winter, a distinction in appearance between the
last wood of a former and the first wood of the succeeding year is
occasioned; so that, in our own country at least, the age of a tree
can be ascertained within some limit by counting the number of zones;
there is, however, great difference in the size of the same species of
trees, even of the same age, and great difference too in the width of
the zones; indeed, you can see this in the case of the wood we have
been sitting upon. See how the zones differ, how broad some are, how
narrow are others; nay, even in one year you see how the zone varies.
The subject of the growth of trees is very interesting, and I would
advise you, when you get older, to pay some attention to it.

Here is another fungus, and a species which I am very glad to find in
the Wrekin woods, though it grows but sparingly. Take it up; turn it
over. How curious! the under side is not a series of gills, as in
_Agaricus_, nor a substance perforated by a number of little holes, as
in _Boletus_. It is formed of a quantity of delicate white teeth or
spines; see how beautiful they are and how easily broken. The spines
are exactly like miniature awls. It is called from the prickly
appearance of the under surface, or _hymenium_, the hedgehog mushroom
(_Hydnum repandum_). "Is it good to eat?" asked Jack. It is, in my
opinion, one of the most exquisite fungi that grows, and the most
curious thing about it is that its flavour very strongly resembles
oysters. Last year we had some of these fellows cut up in bits about
the size of a bean and stewed in white sauce; the sauce we ate with a
beefsteak at dinner, and I do think that as far as flavour is
concerned one might almost pass it off as oyster sauce without any one
finding it out. Not that the hedgehog-mushroom-sauce is really as good
as oyster sauce, but, as I said, the flavour strongly reminds one of
it, nor do I think that any fungi, delicious as they are, can ever
come up to oysters, the _ne-plus-ultra_ of exquisite food.

It is getting towards evening and we must not linger much longer. How
many eatable fungi have we got? let me count. _Lepiota procera_,
_Amanita rubescens_, _Hydnum repandum_, and _Marasmius oreades_ which
we gathered in the meadow before we entered the wood. We will take
them home, they will come in very well either at breakfast or at
dinner time. The other fungi we will also take home and compare them
with the descriptions and drawings in my books.

       *       *       *       *       *

And now our rambles are ended; we have seen there is much to notice,
much to admire. Let us never forget our great Creator who has made all
the beautiful things we see around us; let us learn this lesson from
the contemplation of the works of the Almighty--that as all created
things are fulfilling their appointed work, so we too should fulfil
ours, and by obedience, diligence, kindness, and patience show our
love of Him for whose "pleasure all things are, and were created."

CRITICISMS ON GRACE AGUILAR'S WORKS.

     HOME INFLUENCE.--"To those who really knew Grace Aguilar,
     all eulogium falls short of her deserts, and she has left a
     blank in her particular walk of literature, which we never
     expect to see filled up."--_Pilgrimages to English Shrines,
     by Mrs S. C. Hall._

     MOTHER'S RECOMPENSE.--"'The Mother's Recompense' forms a
     fitting close to its predecessor, 'Home Influence.' The
     results of maternal care are fully developed, its rich
     rewards are set forth, and its lesson and its moral are
     powerfully enforced."--_Morning Post._

     WOMAN'S FRIENDSHIP.--"We congratulate Miss Aguilar on the
     spirit, motive, and composition of this story. Her aims are
     eminently moral, and her cause comes recommended by the most
     beautiful associations. These, connected with the skill here
     evinced in their development, ensure the success of her
     labours."--_Illustrated News._

     VALE OF CEDARS.--"The Authoress of this most fascinating
     volume has selected for her field one of the most remarkable
     eras in modern history--the reigns of Ferdinand and
     Isabella.... It is marked by much power of description, and
     by a woman's delicacy of touch, and it will add to its
     writer's well-earned reputation."--_Eclectic Review._

     DAYS OF BRUCE.--"The tale is well told, the interest warmly
     sustained throughout, and the delineation of female
     character is marked by a delicate sense of moral beauty. It
     is a work that may be confided to the hands of a daughter by
     her parent."--_Court Journal._

     HOME SCENES.--"Grace Aguilar knew the female heart better
     than any writer of our day, and in every fiction from her
     pen we trace the same masterly analysis and development of
     the motives and feelings of woman's nature."--_Critic._

     WOMEN OF ISRAEL.--"A work that is sufficient of itself to
     create and crown a reputation."--_Mrs. S. C. Hall._

     events of the great Admiral's life from the lips of an old

     Shannon, intended to show, by the conduct of a party of
     young people, that rashness and disobedience are no proofs

     "We have read most of them with great care, for we are very
     watchful over books for the young, and can assure our
     readers they are well worth a mother's attention. They vary
     in interest and in moral value, but all of them are
     calculated both to amuse and instruct. Some convey valuable
     historical information, others lessons in natural history,
     and most of them convey a healthy moral influence. All are
     subservient to religion as well as morals, but they are not
     tinctured with any ism, nor do they inculcate any peculiar
     tenets."--_British Mothers' Journal._
