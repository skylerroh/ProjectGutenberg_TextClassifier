Phil silently got up, tossed her box of chocolates away, went up to
Anne, and put her arms about her.

"Anne, I wish I was like you," she said soberly.

Diana met Anne at the Carmody station the next night, and they drove
home together under silent, star-sown depths of sky. Green Gables had a
very festal appearance as they drove up the lane. There was a light in
every window, the glow breaking out through the darkness like flame-red
blossoms swung against the dark background of the Haunted Wood. And in
the yard was a brave bonfire with two gay little figures dancing around
it, one of which gave an unearthly yell as the buggy turned in under the
poplars.

"Davy means that for an Indian war-whoop," said Diana. "Mr. Harrison's
hired boy taught it to him, and he's been practicing it up to welcome
you with. Mrs. Lynde says it has worn her nerves to a frazzle. He creeps
up behind her, you know, and then lets go. He was determined to have a
bonfire for you, too. He's been piling up branches for a fortnight
and pestering Marilla to be let pour some kerosene oil over it before
setting it on fire. I guess she did, by the smell, though Mrs. Lynde
said up to the last that Davy would blow himself and everybody else up
if he was let."

Anne was out of the buggy by this time, and Davy was rapturously hugging
her knees, while even Dora was clinging to her hand.

"Isn't that a bully bonfire, Anne? Just let me show you how to poke
it--see the sparks? I did it for you, Anne, 'cause I was so glad you
were coming home."

The kitchen door opened and Marilla's spare form darkened against the
inner light. She preferred to meet Anne in the shadows, for she
was horribly afraid that she was going to cry with joy--she, stern,
repressed Marilla, who thought all display of deep emotion unseemly.
Mrs. Lynde was behind her, sonsy, kindly, matronly, as of yore. The love
that Anne had told Phil was waiting for her surrounded her and enfolded
her with its blessing and its sweetness. Nothing, after all, could
compare with old ties, old friends, and old Green Gables! How starry
Anne's eyes were as they sat down to the loaded supper table, how pink
her cheeks, how silver-clear her laughter! And Diana was going to stay
all night, too. How like the dear old times it was! And the rose-bud
tea-set graced the table! With Marilla the force of nature could no
further go.

"I suppose you and Diana will now proceed to talk all night," said
Marilla sarcastically, as the girls went upstairs. Marilla was always
sarcastic after any self-betrayal.

"Yes," agreed Anne gaily, "but I'm going to put Davy to bed first. He
insists on that."

"You bet," said Davy, as they went along the hall. "I want somebody to
say my prayers to again. It's no fun saying them alone."

"You don't say them alone, Davy. God is always with you to hear you."

"Well, I can't see Him," objected Davy. "I want to pray to somebody I
can see, but I WON'T say them to Mrs. Lynde or Marilla, there now!"

Nevertheless, when Davy was garbed in his gray flannel nighty, he did
not seem in a hurry to begin. He stood before Anne, shuffling one bare
foot over the other, and looked undecided.

"Come, dear, kneel down," said Anne.

Davy came and buried his head in Anne's lap, but he did not kneel down.

"Anne," he said in a muffled voice. "I don't feel like praying after
all. I haven't felt like it for a week now. I--I DIDN'T pray last night
nor the night before."

"Why not, Davy?" asked Anne gently.

"You--you won't be mad if I tell you?" implored Davy.

Anne lifted the little gray-flannelled body on her knee and cuddled his
head on her arm.

"Do I ever get 'mad' when you tell me things, Davy?"

"No-o-o, you never do. But you get sorry, and that's worse. You'll be
awful sorry when I tell you this, Anne--and you'll be 'shamed of me, I
s'pose."

"Have you done something naughty, Davy, and is that why you can't say
your prayers?"

"No, I haven't done anything naughty--yet. But I want to do it."

"What is it, Davy?"

"I--I want to say a bad word, Anne," blurted out Davy, with a desperate
effort. "I heard Mr. Harrison's hired boy say it one day last week,
and ever since I've been wanting to say it ALL the time--even when I'm
saying my prayers."

"Say it then, Davy."

Davy lifted his flushed face in amazement.

"But, Anne, it's an AWFUL bad word."

"SAY IT!"

Davy gave her another incredulous look, then in a low voice he said the
dreadful word. The next minute his face was burrowing against her.

"Oh, Anne, I'll never say it again--never. I'll never WANT to say it
again. I knew it was bad, but I didn't s'pose it was so--so--I didn't
s'pose it was like THAT."

"No, I don't think you'll ever want to say it again, Davy--or think it,
either. And I wouldn't go about much with Mr. Harrison's hired boy if I
were you."

"He can make bully war-whoops," said Davy a little regretfully.

"But you don't want your mind filled with bad words, do you, Davy--words
that will poison it and drive out all that is good and manly?"

"No," said Davy, owl-eyed with introspection.

"Then don't go with those people who use them. And now do you feel as if
you could say your prayers, Davy?"

"Oh, yes," said Davy, eagerly wriggling down on his knees, "I can say
them now all right. I ain't scared now to say 'if I should die before I
wake,' like I was when I was wanting to say that word."

Probably Anne and Diana did empty out their souls to each other that
night, but no record of their confidences has been preserved. They both
looked as fresh and bright-eyed at breakfast as only youth can look
after unlawful hours of revelry and confession. There had been no snow
up to this time, but as Diana crossed the old log bridge on her homeward
way the white flakes were beginning to flutter down over the fields
and woods, russet and gray in their dreamless sleep. Soon the far-away
slopes and hills were dim and wraith-like through their gauzy scarfing,
as if pale autumn had flung a misty bridal veil over her hair and was
waiting for her wintry bridegroom. So they had a white Christmas after
all, and a very pleasant day it was. In the forenoon letters and gifts
came from Miss Lavendar and Paul; Anne opened them in the cheerful Green
Gables kitchen, which was filled with what Davy, sniffing in ecstasy,
called "pretty smells."

"Miss Lavendar and Mr. Irving are settled in their new home now,"
reported Anne. "I am sure Miss Lavendar is perfectly happy--I know it
by the general tone of her letter--but there's a note from Charlotta the
Fourth. She doesn't like Boston at all, and she is fearfully homesick.
Miss Lavendar wants me to go through to Echo Lodge some day while
I'm home and light a fire to air it, and see that the cushions aren't
getting moldy. I think I'll get Diana to go over with me next week, and
we can spend the evening with Theodora Dix. I want to see Theodora. By
the way, is Ludovic Speed still going to see her?"

"They say so," said Marilla, "and he's likely to continue it. Folks have
given up expecting that that courtship will ever arrive anywhere."

"I'd hurry him up a bit, if I was Theodora, that's what," said Mrs.
Lynde. And there is not the slightest doubt but that she would.

There was also a characteristic scrawl from Philippa, full of Alec and
Alonzo, what they said and what they did, and how they looked when they
saw her.

"But I can't make up my mind yet which to marry," wrote Phil. "I do wish
you had come with me to decide for me. Some one will have to. When I saw
Alec my heart gave a great thump and I thought, 'He might be the right
one.' And then, when Alonzo came, thump went my heart again. So that's
no guide, though it should be, according to all the novels I've ever
read. Now, Anne, YOUR heart wouldn't thump for anybody but the genuine
Prince Charming, would it? There must be something radically wrong with
mine. But I'm having a perfectly gorgeous time. How I wish you were
here! It's snowing today, and I'm rapturous. I was so afraid we'd have
a green Christmas and I loathe them. You know, when Christmas is a dirty
grayey-browney affair, looking as if it had been left over a hundred
years ago and had been in soak ever since, it is called a GREEN
Christmas! Don't ask me why. As Lord Dundreary says, 'there are thome
thingth no fellow can underthtand.'

"Anne, did you ever get on a street car and then discover that you
hadn't any money with you to pay your fare? I did, the other day. It's
quite awful. I had a nickel with me when I got on the car. I thought it
was in the left pocket of my coat. When I got settled down comfortably
I felt for it. It wasn't there. I had a cold chill. I felt in the other
pocket. Not there. I had another chill. Then I felt in a little inside
pocket. All in vain. I had two chills at once.

"I took off my gloves, laid them on the seat, and went over all my
pockets again. It was not there. I stood up and shook myself, and then
looked on the floor. The car was full of people, who were going home
from the opera, and they all stared at me, but I was past caring for a
little thing like that.

"But I could not find my fare. I concluded I must have put it in my
mouth and swallowed it inadvertently.

"I didn't know what to do. Would the conductor, I wondered, stop the
car and put me off in ignominy and shame? Was it possible that I could
convince him that I was merely the victim of my own absentmindedness,
and not an unprincipled creature trying to obtain a ride upon false
pretenses? How I wished that Alec or Alonzo were there. But they weren't
because I wanted them. If I HADN'T wanted them they would have been
there by the dozen. And I couldn't decide what to say to the conductor
when he came around. As soon as I got one sentence of explanation
mapped out in my mind I felt nobody could believe it and I must compose
another. It seemed there was nothing to do but trust in Providence, and
for all the comfort that gave me I might as well have been the old lady
who, when told by the captain during a storm that she must put her trust
in the Almighty exclaimed, 'Oh, Captain, is it as bad as that?'

"Just at the conventional moment, when all hope had fled, and the
conductor was holding out his box to the passenger next to me, I
suddenly remembered where I had put that wretched coin of the realm.
I hadn't swallowed it after all. I meekly fished it out of the index
finger of my glove and poked it in the box. I smiled at everybody and
felt that it was a beautiful world."

The visit to Echo Lodge was not the least pleasant of many pleasant
holiday outings. Anne and Diana went back to it by the old way of the
beech woods, carrying a lunch basket with them. Echo Lodge, which had
been closed ever since Miss Lavendar's wedding, was briefly thrown open
to wind and sunshine once more, and firelight glimmered again in the
little rooms. The perfume of Miss Lavendar's rose bowl still filled the
air. It was hardly possible to believe that Miss Lavendar would not come
tripping in presently, with her brown eyes a-star with welcome, and
that Charlotta the Fourth, blue of bow and wide of smile, would not
pop through the door. Paul, too, seemed hovering around, with his fairy
fancies.

"It really makes me feel a little bit like a ghost revisiting the old
time glimpses of the moon," laughed Anne. "Let's go out and see if the
echoes are at home. Bring the old horn. It is still behind the kitchen
door."

The echoes were at home, over the white river, as silver-clear and
multitudinous as ever; and when they had ceased to answer the girls
locked up Echo Lodge again and went away in the perfect half hour that
follows the rose and saffron of a winter sunset.




Chapter VIII

Anne's First Proposal


The old year did not slip away in a green twilight, with a pinky-yellow
sunset. Instead, it went out with a wild, white bluster and blow. It was
one of the nights when the storm-wind hurtles over the frozen meadows
and black hollows, and moans around the eaves like a lost creature, and
drives the snow sharply against the shaking panes.

"Just the sort of night people like to cuddle down between their
blankets and count their mercies," said Anne to Jane Andrews, who had
come up to spend the afternoon and stay all night. But when they were
cuddled between their blankets, in Anne's little porch room, it was not
her mercies of which Jane was thinking.

"Anne," she said very solemnly, "I want to tell you something. May I"

Anne was feeling rather sleepy after the party Ruby Gillis had given the
night before. She would much rather have gone to sleep than listen
to Jane's confidences, which she was sure would bore her. She had no
prophetic inkling of what was coming. Probably Jane was engaged,
too; rumor averred that Ruby Gillis was engaged to the Spencervale
schoolteacher, about whom all the girls were said to be quite wild.

"I'll soon be the only fancy-free maiden of our old quartet," thought
Anne, drowsily. Aloud she said, "Of course."

"Anne," said Jane, still more solemnly, "what do you think of my brother
Billy?"

Anne gasped over this unexpected question, and floundered helplessly
in her thoughts. Goodness, what DID she think of Billy Andrews? She
had never thought ANYTHING about him--round-faced, stupid, perpetually
smiling, good-natured Billy Andrews. Did ANYBODY ever think about Billy
Andrews?

"I--I don't understand, Jane," she stammered. "What do you
mean--exactly?"

"Do you like Billy?" asked Jane bluntly.

"Why--why--yes, I like him, of course," gasped Anne, wondering if she
were telling the literal truth. Certainly she did not DISlike Billy.
But could the indifferent tolerance with which she regarded him, when he
happened to be in her range of vision, be considered positive enough for
liking? WHAT was Jane trying to elucidate?

"Would you like him for a husband?" asked Jane calmly.

"A husband!" Anne had been sitting up in bed, the better to wrestle with
the problem of her exact opinion of Billy Andrews. Now she fell flatly
back on her pillows, the very breath gone out of her. "Whose husband?"

"Yours, of course," answered Jane. "Billy wants to marry you. He's
always been crazy about you--and now father has given him the upper farm
in his own name and there's nothing to prevent him from getting married.
But he's so shy he couldn't ask you himself if you'd have him, so he got
me to do it. I'd rather not have, but he gave me no peace till I said I
would, if I got a good chance. What do you think about it, Anne?"

Was it a dream? Was it one of those nightmare things in which you find
yourself engaged or married to some one you hate or don't know, without
the slightest idea how it ever came about? No, she, Anne Shirley, was
lying there, wide awake, in her own bed, and Jane Andrews was beside
her, calmly proposing for her brother Billy. Anne did not know whether
she wanted to writhe or laugh; but she could do neither, for Jane's
