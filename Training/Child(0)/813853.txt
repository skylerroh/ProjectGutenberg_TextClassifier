You are very kind, Mary, to have a nice fire for me. I am cold after my
long drive.

Yes, Fred, you look cold and tired, but you will soon get warm by this
fire. How far did you drive?

Seven miles, and the snow and ice made it a cold ride.

Can we skate on the lake now, Fred?

Yes, the ice is strong. We can have a good skate. Do you want to go and
try it?

O yes, Fred! I like to skate. Will you go with me?

Yes, as soon as I get warm. But John and Ann are coming over to see us.

Well, Fred, we will ask them to go with us. Ann likes to skate.

O yes! if they go, we shall have a merry time.

What fun it will be, Fred! I will run now and find my hat. We will go as
soon as they come.

Papa', I want to sail in the new boat. Will you take me out?

It is pretty cold, Frank. See how the wind blows, and how the waves roll
on the beach. I know it is cold, papa', but I have on a warm coat.

Well, come on. I will hold the boat while you get in.

So Frank and his papa' got into the boat and put up the sail.

The waves were very high, but Frank was not afraid. The boat was strong,
and his papa' could sail it well.

The waves dashed over the side of the boat, but the more they dashed,
the more fun it was for Frank.

When Frank got to be a man, he was so fond of the water that he went to
sea in a large ship.

He learned how to sail the ship, and after a while, he was made captain
of it.

He is an old man now, and likes to tell little boys and girls all he
learned and saw while he was captain of a ship.

One day, when Frank and John were going to school, they saw an old man
with a flute.

"Will you please play a tune for us, sir?" said Frank.

"Yes, boys, I will play for you. Are you fond of music?" "Yes, sir, we
like music. You used to play your flute when I went with mamma' to see
you."

"O you are the little boy who had your flute with you, are you?"

[Illustration]

"Yes, sir, and I have learned to play a little on it."

"Well, I am glad to see you again, my boy.

"I will play you a tune, and then you must play for me."

"But my flute is at home, sir."

"O well, you can use mine. It is a good one."

The old man played a tune for the boys, and then gave the flute to Frank
to play.

Frank played a tune, and did it very well.

"How well you play!" said the old man.

"You are very kind to say that, but I wish I could play as well as you
do," said Frank.

"O you will soon do that. All you will have to do is to try."

PEARLS IN VERSE.[A]

  Be the matter what it may,
    Always speak the truth.
  If at work, or if at play,
    Always speak the truth.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Do your best, your very best,
    And do it every day.
  Little boys and little girls,
    That is the wisest way.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Little children, love each other,
    Never give another pain,
  If your brother speak in anger,
    Answer not in wrath again.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Early to bed and early to rise,
  Make men healthy, wealthy, and wise.

[Footnote A: It is intended that these selections shall be memorized by
pupils, but as they do not form any part of the reading lessons, the
words not heretofore used are not regarded as "new words."]

  Suppose your task, my little man,
    Is very hard to get?
  Will it make it any easier
    For you to sit and fret?
  
  Then wouldn't it he wiser
    Than waiting like a dunce,
  To go to work in earnest,
    And learn the thing at once?

       *       *       *       *       *

  Speak the truth, and speak it ever,
    Cost it what it will;
  He who hides the wrong he did,
    Does the wrong thing still.

       *       *       *       *       * 

  To do to others as I would
    That they should do to me,
  Will make me honest, kind, and good,
    As children ought to be.

       *       *       *       *       * 

  When mother says, "Do this," or "that,"
    Don't say, "What for?" and "Why?"
  But let her hear your gentle voice
    Say, "Mother dear, I'll try."
