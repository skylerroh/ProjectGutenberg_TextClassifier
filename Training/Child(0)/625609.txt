    And down the red-hot valley, lo!
    The phantom armies marching go!

    Blinking embers, tell me true
    Where are those armies marching to,
    And what the burning city is
    That crumbles in your furnaces!

THE LITTLE LAND


    When at home alone I sit,
    And am very tired of it,
    I have just to shut my eyes
    To go sailing through the skies--
    To go sailing far away
    To the pleasant Land of Play;
    To the fairy land afar
    Where the Little People are;
    Where the clover-tops are trees,
    And the rain-pools are the seas,
    And the leaves, like little ships,
    Sail about on tiny trips;
    And above the daisy tree
      Through the grasses,
    High o'erhead the Bumble Bee
      Hums and passes.

    In that forest to and fro
    I can wander, I can go;
    See the spider and the fly,
    And the ants go marching by,
    Carrying parcels with their feet
    Down the green and grassy street.
    I can in the sorrel sit
    Where the ladybird alit.
    I can climb the jointed grass
      And on high
    See the greater swallows pass
      In the sky,
    And the round sun rolling by
    Heeding no such things as I.

    Through that forest I can pass
    Till, as in a looking-glass,
    Humming fly and daisy tree
    And my tiny self I see,
    Painted very clear and neat
    On the rain-pool at my feet.
    Should a leaflet come to land
    Drifting near to where I stand,
    Straight I'll board that tiny boat
    Round the rain-pool sea to float.

    Little thoughtful creatures sit
    On the grassy coasts of it;
    Little things with lovely eyes
    See me sailing with surprise.
    Some are clad in armour green--
    (These have sure to battle been!)--
    Some are pied with ev'ry hue,
    Black and crimson, gold and blue;
    Some have wings and swift are gone;--
    But they all look kindly on.

    [Illustration: THE LITTLE LAND]

      When my eyes I once again
      Open, and see all things plain:
    High bare walls, great bare floor;
    Great big knobs on drawer and door;
    Great big people perched on chairs,
    Stitching tucks and mending tears,
    Each a hill that I could climb,
    And talking nonsense all the time--
      O dear me,
      That I could be
    A sailor on the rain-pool sea,
    A climber in the clover tree,
    And just come back, a sleepy-head,
    Late at night to go to bed.




GARDEN DAYS

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




NIGHT AND DAY


    When the golden day is done,
      Through the closing portal,
    Child and garden, flower and sun,
      Vanish all things mortal.

    As the blinding shadows fall
      As the rays diminish,
    Under evening's cloak, they all
      Roll away and vanish.

    Garden darkened, daisy shut,
      Child in bed, they slumber--
    Glow-worm in the highway rut,
      Mice among the lumber.

    In the darkness houses shine,
      Parents move with candles;
    Till on all, the night divine
      Turns the bedroom handles.

    Till at last the day begins
      In the east a-breaking,
    In the hedges and the whins
      Sleeping birds a-waking.

    In the darkness shapes of things,
      Houses, trees and hedges,
    Clearer grow; and sparrow's wings
      Beat on window ledges.

    These shall wake the yawning maid;
      She the door shall open--
    Finding dew on garden glade
      And the morning broken.

    There my garden grows again
      Green and rosy painted,
    As at eve behind the pane
      From my eyes it fainted.

    Just as it was shut away,
      Toy-like, in the even,
    Here I see it glow with day
      Under glowing heaven.

    Every path and every plot,
      Every bush of roses,
    Every blue forget-me-not
      Where the dew reposes.

    "Up!" they cry, "the day is come
      On the smiling valleys:
    We have beat the morning drum;
      Playmate, join your allies!"

NEST EGGS


    Birds all the sunny day
      Flutter and quarrel
    Here in the arbour-like
      Tent of the laurel.

    Here in the fork
      The brown nest is seated;
    Four little blue eggs
      The mother keeps heated.

    While we stand watching her
      Staring like gabies,
    Safe in each egg are the
      Bird's little babies.

    Soon the frail eggs they shall
      Chip, and upspringing
    Make all the April woods
      Merry with singing.

    Younger than we are,
      O children, and frailer,
    Soon in blue air they'll be,
      Singer and sailor.

    We, so much older,
      Taller and stronger,
    We shall look down on the
      Birdies no longer.

    They shall go flying
      With musical speeches
    High over head in the
      Tops of the beeches.

    In spite of our wisdom
      And sensible talking,
    We on our feet must go
      Plodding and walking.

THE FLOWERS


    All the names I know from nurse:
    Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse,
    Bachelor's buttons, Lady's smock,
    And the Lady Hollyhock.

    Fairy places, fairy things,
    Fairy woods where the wild bee wings,
    Tiny trees for tiny dames--
    These must all be fairy names!

    Tiny woods below whose boughs
    Shady fairies weave a house;
    Tiny tree-tops, rose or thyme,
    Where the braver fairies climb!

[Illustration: THE FLOWERS]

    Fair are grown-up people's trees,
    But the fairest woods are these;
    Where, if I were not so tall,
    I should live for good and all.




SUMMER SUN


    Great is the sun, and wide he goes
    Through empty heaven without repose;
    And in the blue and glowing days
    More thick than rain he showers his rays.

    Though closer still the blinds we pull
    To keep the shady parlour cool,
    Yet he will find a chink or two
    To slip his golden fingers through.

    The dusty attic spider-clad
    He, through the keyhole, maketh glad;
    And through the broken edge of tiles
    Into the laddered hay-loft smiles.

    Meantime his golden face around
    He bares to all the garden ground,
    And sheds a warm and glittering look
    Among the ivy's inmost nook.

    Above the hills, along the blue,
    Round the bright air with footing true,
    To please the child, to paint the rose,
    The gardener of the World, he goes.

THE DUMB SOLDIER


    When the grass was closely mown,
    Walking on the lawn alone,
    In the turf a hole I found,
    And hid a soldier underground.

    Spring and daisies came apace;
    Grasses hide my hiding place;
    Grasses run like a green sea
    O'er the lawn up to my knee.
