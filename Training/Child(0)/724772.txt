THE LAKE REGION OF CENTRAL AFRICA.
SIAM, THE LAND OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT.

Each volume is complete in itself, and contains, first, a brief
preliminary sketch of the country to which it is devoted; next, such an
outline of previous explorations as may be necessary to explain what has
been achieved by later ones; and finally, a condensation of one or more
of the most important narratives of recent travel, accompanied with
illustrations of the scenery, architecture, and life of the races, drawn
only from the most authentic sources.

"Authenticated accounts of countries, peoples, modes of living and
being, curiosities in natural history, and personal adventure in travels
and explorations, suggest a rich fund of solid instruction combined with
delightful entertainment. The editorship by one of the most observant
and well-travelled men of modern times, at once secures the high
character of the 'Library' in every particular."

In these three volumes, Mr. Baldwin presents in consecutive narrative
forms the Legends relating to the Trojan War, the great Siegfried myth
of Northern Europe, and the mediaeval romance of Roland and Charlemange;
bringing before the reader, with great spirit, with scholarly accuracy
and with unfailing taste these heroic figures and the times in which
their adventures are supposed to have occurred.

"Mr. Baldwin's book is redolent with the spirit of the Odyssey, that
glorious primitive epic, fresh with the dew of the morning of time. It
is an unalloyed pleasure to read his recital of the adventures of the
wily Odysseus, slightly expurgated though it be, and adapted for the
intelligence of youthful minds. Howard Pyle's illustrations render the
spirit of the Homeric age with admirable felicity."
--_Prof. H. H. Boyesen._

"Mr. Baldwin's work here as in 'Siegfried' and 'Roland' is of
exceptional merit, and is to be classed with the 'Tanglewood Tales' of
Hawthorne rather than with the average story for the young. Mr. Pyle has
furnished the volume with a dozen drawings of great artistic excellence
and of genuinely illustrative character."

"'The Story of Siegfried' is charmingly told. The author makes up the

excellent one for young readers."

"We have devoured the book at a sitting; and were the question to arise
which of the author's two books, 'Treasure Island' or 'The Black Arrow,'
should be preserved, if only one of them could escape destruction, we
should hesitate not a moment to cry out for 'The Black Arrow.' It has
all the charm of the other book and something more."
--_The Critic._

"The Black Arrows are a kind of Robin Hoods, who forgather in the
greenwood, kill the King's venison, waylay the King's subjects, and
exercise a simple and primitive injustice by killing everybody in any
way connected with the objects of their special animosity. Mr. Stevenson
has made a striking series of dramatic pictures. The action is vigorous
and incessant. The lawless condition of the time is kept in evidence.
Everybody is fighting or flying, plotting or baffling plots, doing or
hindering overt wrong. The tale sweeps on to its close with plenty of
elan."
