RAINBOW VALLEY



CHAPTER I. HOME AGAIN

It was a clear, apple-green evening in May, and Four Winds Harbour was
mirroring back the clouds of the golden west between its softly dark
shores. The sea moaned eerily on the sand-bar, sorrowful even in spring,
but a sly, jovial wind came piping down the red harbour road along which
Miss Cornelia's comfortable, matronly figure was making its way towards
the village of Glen St. Mary. Miss Cornelia was rightfully Mrs. Marshall
Elliott, and had been Mrs. Marshall Elliott for thirteen years, but even
yet more people referred to her as Miss Cornelia than as Mrs.
Elliott. The old name was dear to her old friends, only one of them
contemptuously dropped it. Susan Baker, the gray and grim and faithful
handmaiden of the Blythe family at Ingleside, never lost an opportunity
of calling her "Mrs. Marshall Elliott," with the most killing and
pointed emphasis, as if to say "You wanted to be Mrs. and Mrs. you shall
be with a vengeance as far as I am concerned."

Miss Cornelia was going up to Ingleside to see Dr. and Mrs. Blythe, who
were just home from Europe. They had been away for three months, having
left in February to attend a famous medical congress in London; and
certain things, which Miss Cornelia was anxious to discuss, had taken
place in the Glen during their absence. For one thing, there was a new
family in the manse. And such a family! Miss Cornelia shook her head
over them several times as she walked briskly along.

Susan Baker and the Anne Shirley of other days saw her coming, as they
sat on the big veranda at Ingleside, enjoying the charm of the cat's
light, the sweetness of sleepy robins whistling among the twilit maples,
and the dance of a gusty group of daffodils blowing against the old,
mellow, red brick wall of the lawn.

Anne was sitting on the steps, her hands clasped over her knee, looking,
in the kind dusk, as girlish as a mother of many has any right to be;
and the beautiful gray-green eyes, gazing down the harbour road, were
as full of unquenchable sparkle and dream as ever. Behind her, in the
hammock, Rilla Blythe was curled up, a fat, roly-poly little creature
of six years, the youngest of the Ingleside children. She had curly red
hair and hazel eyes that were now buttoned up after the funny, wrinkled
fashion in which Rilla always went to sleep.

Shirley, "the little brown boy," as he was known in the family "Who's
Who," was asleep in Susan's arms. He was brown-haired, brown-eyed and
brown-skinned, with very rosy cheeks, and he was Susan's especial
love. After his birth Anne had been very ill for a long time, and Susan
"mothered" the baby with a passionate tenderness which none of the other
children, dear as they were to her, had ever called out. Dr. Blythe had
said that but for her he would never have lived.

"I gave him life just as much as you did, Mrs. Dr. dear," Susan was wont
to say. "He is just as much my baby as he is yours." And, indeed, it was
always to Susan that Shirley ran, to be kissed for bumps, and rocked
to sleep, and protected from well-deserved spankings. Susan had
conscientiously spanked all the other Blythe children when she thought
they needed it for their souls' good, but she would not spank Shirley
nor allow his mother to do it. Once, Dr. Blythe had spanked him and
Susan had been stormily indignant.

"That man would spank an angel, Mrs. Dr. dear, that he would," she had
declared bitterly; and she would not make the poor doctor a pie for
weeks.

She had taken Shirley with her to her brother's home during his parents'
absence, while all the other children had gone to Avonlea, and she had
three blessed months of him all to herself. Nevertheless, Susan was very
glad to find herself back at Ingleside, with all her darlings around her
again. Ingleside was her world and in it she reigned supreme. Even Anne
seldom questioned her decisions, much to the disgust of Mrs. Rachel
Lynde of Green Gables, who gloomily told Anne, whenever she visited Four
Winds, that she was letting Susan get to be entirely too much of a boss
and would live to rue it.

"Here is Cornelia Bryant coming up the harbour road, Mrs. Dr. dear,"
said Susan. "She will be coming up to unload three months' gossip on
us."

"I hope so," said Anne, hugging her knees. "I'm starving for Glen St.
Mary gossip, Susan. I hope Miss Cornelia can tell me everything that
has happened while we've been away--EVERYTHING--who has got born, or
married, or drunk; who has died, or gone away, or come, or fought, or
lost a cow, or found a beau. It's so delightful to be home again with
all the dear Glen folks, and I want to know all about them. Why, I
remember wondering, as I walked through Westminster Abbey which of her
two especial beaux Millicent Drew would finally marry. Do you know,
Susan, I have a dreadful suspicion that I love gossip."

"Well, of course, Mrs. Dr. dear," admitted Susan, "every proper woman
likes to hear the news. I am rather interested in Millicent Drew's case
myself. I never had a beau, much less two, and I do not mind now, for
being an old maid does not hurt when you get used to it. Millicent's
hair always looks to me as if she had swept it up with a broom. But the
men do not seem to mind that."

"They see only her pretty, piquant, mocking, little face, Susan."

"That may very well be, Mrs. Dr. dear. The Good Book says that favour is
deceitful and beauty is vain, but I should not have minded finding that
out for myself, if it had been so ordained. I have no doubt we will
all be beautiful when we are angels, but what good will it do us then?
Speaking of gossip, however, they do say that poor Mrs. Harrison Miller
over harbour tried to hang herself last week."

"Oh, Susan!"

"Calm yourself, Mrs. Dr. dear. She did not succeed. But I really do not
blame her for trying, for her husband is a terrible man. But she was
very foolish to think of hanging herself and leaving the way clear for
him to marry some other woman. If I had been in her shoes, Mrs. Dr.
dear, I would have gone to work to worry him so that he would try
to hang himself instead of me. Not that I hold with people hanging
themselves under any circumstances, Mrs. Dr. dear."

"What is the matter with Harrison Miller, anyway?" said Anne
impatiently. "He is always driving some one to extremes."

"Well, some people call it religion and some call it cussedness, begging
your pardon, Mrs. Dr. dear, for using such a word. It seems they cannot
make out which it is in Harrison's case. There are days when he
growls at everybody because he thinks he is fore-ordained to eternal
punishment. And then there are days when he says he does not care and
goes and gets drunk. My own opinion is that he is not sound in his
intellect, for none of that branch of the Millers were. His grandfather
went out of his mind. He thought he was surrounded by big black spiders.
They crawled over him and floated in the air about him. I hope I shall
never go insane, Mrs. Dr. dear, and I do not think I will, because it is
not a habit of the Bakers. But, if an all-wise Providence should decree
it, I hope it will not take the form of big black spiders, for I loathe
the animals. As for Mrs. Miller, I do not know whether she really
deserves pity or not. There are some who say she just married Harrison
to spite Richard Taylor, which seems to me a very peculiar reason
for getting married. But then, of course, _I_ am no judge of things
matrimonial, Mrs. Dr. dear. And there is Cornelia Bryant at the gate, so
I will put this blessed brown baby on his bed and get my knitting."



CHAPTER II. SHEER GOSSIP

"Where are the other children?" asked Miss Cornelia, when the first
greetings--cordial on her side, rapturous on Anne's, and dignified on
Susan's--were over.

"Shirley is in bed and Jem and Walter and the twins are down in their
beloved Rainbow Valley," said Anne. "They just came home this afternoon,
you know, and they could hardly wait until supper was over before
rushing down to the valley. They love it above every spot on earth. Even
the maple grove doesn't rival it in their affections."

"I am afraid they love it too well," said Susan gloomily. "Little Jem
said once he would rather go to Rainbow Valley than to heaven when he
died, and that was not a proper remark."

"I suppose they had a great time in Avonlea?" said Miss Cornelia.

"Enormous. Marilla does spoil them terribly. Jem, in particular, can do
no wrong in her eyes."

"Miss Cuthbert must be an old lady now," said Miss Cornelia, getting out
her knitting, so that she could hold her own with Susan. Miss Cornelia
held that the woman whose hands were employed always had the advantage
over the woman whose hands were not.

"Marilla is eighty-five," said Anne with a sigh. "Her hair is
snow-white. But, strange to say, her eyesight is better than it was when
she was sixty."

"Well, dearie, I'm real glad you're all back. I've been dreadful
lonesome. But we haven't been dull in the Glen, believe ME. There hasn't
been such an exciting spring in my time, as far as church matters go.
We've got settled with a minister at last, Anne dearie."

"The Reverend John Knox Meredith, Mrs. Dr. dear," said Susan, resolved
not to let Miss Cornelia tell all the news.

"Is he nice?" asked Anne interestedly.

Miss Cornelia sighed and Susan groaned.

"Yes, he's nice enough if that were all," said the former. "He is VERY
nice--and very learned--and very spiritual. But, oh Anne dearie, he has
no common sense!

"How was it you called him, then?"

"Well, there's no doubt he is by far the best preacher we ever had in
Glen St. Mary church," said Miss Cornelia, veering a tack or two. "I
suppose it is because he is so moony and absent-minded that he never got
a town call. His trial sermon was simply wonderful, believe ME. Every
one went mad about it--and his looks."
