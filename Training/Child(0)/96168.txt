
"Then to whom shall we take it?" asked the messengers.

"Take it to Cleobulus, [Footnote: Cle o bu'lus.] King of Rhodes,
[Footnote: Rhodes (_pro_. rodes).]" answered the wise man. "He is the
handsomest and strongest of men, and I believe he is the wisest also."



IV


The messengers went on until they came at last to the island of Rhodes.
There everybody was talking about King Cleobulus and his wonderful
wisdom. He had studied in all the great schools of the world, and there
was nothing that he did not know.

"Educate the children," he said; and for that reason his name is
remembered to this day.

When the messengers showed him the tripod, he said, "That is indeed
a beautiful piece of work. Will you sell it? What is the price?"

They told him that it was not for sale, but that it was to be given
to the wisest of the wise.

"Well, you will not find that man in Rhodes," said he. "He lives in
Corinth, [Footnote: Cor'inth.] and his name is Periander. [Footnote:
Per i an'der.] Carry the precious gift to him."



V


Everybody had heard of Periander, king of Corinth. Some had heard of
his great learning, and others had heard of his selfishness and
cruelty.

Strangers admired him for his wisdom. His own people despised him
for his wickedness.

When he heard that some men had come to Corinth with a very costly
golden tripod, he had them brought before him.

"I have heard all about that tripod," he said, "and I know why you are
carrying it from one place to another. Do you expect to find any man
in Corinth who deserves so rich a gift?"

"We hope that you are the man," said the messengers.

"Ha! ha I" laughed Periander. "Do I look like the wisest of the wise?
No, indeed. But in Lacedaemon [Footnote: Lacedaemon (_pro_. las e
de'mon).] there is a good and noble man named Chilon.[Footnote: Chilon
(_pro_. ki'lon).] He loves his country, he loves his fellow men, he
loves learning. To my mind he deserves the golden prize. I bid you
carry it to him."



VI


The messengers were surprised. They had never heard of Chilon, for his
name was hardly known outside of his own country. But when they came
into Lacedaemon, they heard his praises on every side.

They learned that Chilon was a very quiet man, that he never spoke
about himself, and that he spent all his time in trying to make his
country great and strong and happy.

Chilon was so busy that the messengers had to wait several days before
they could see him. At last they were allowed to go before him and
state their business.

"We have here a very beautiful tripod," they said. "The oracle at
Delphi has ordered that it shall be given to the wisest of wise men,
and for that reason we have brought it to you."

"You have made a mistake," said Chilon. "Over in Athens [Footnote:
Ath'ens.] there is a very wise man whose name is Solon. [Footnote:
So'lon.] He is a poet, a soldier, and a lawmaker. He is my worst enemy,
and yet I admire him as the wisest man in the world. It is to him that
you should have taken the tripod."



VII


The messengers made due haste to carry the golden prize to Athens.
They had no trouble in finding Solon. He was the chief ruler of that
great city.

All the people whom they saw spoke in praise of his wisdom.

When they told him their errand he was silent for a little while; then
he said:--

"I have never thought of myself as a wise man, and therefore the prize
is not for me. But I know of at least six men who are famous for their
wisdom, and one of them must be the wisest of the wise."

"Who are they?" asked the messengers.

"Their names are Thales, Bias, Pittacus, Cleobulus, Periander, and
Chilon," answered Solon.

"We have offered the prize to each one of them," said the messengers,
"and each one has refused it."

"Then there is only one other thing to be done," said Solon. "Carry
it to Delphi and leave it there in the Temple of Apollo; for Apollo
is the fountain of wisdom, the wisest of the wise."

And this the messengers did.

The famous men of whom I have told you in this story are commonly
called the Seven Wise Men of Greece. They lived more than two thousand
years ago, and each one helped to make his country famous.

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK, FIFTY FAMOUS PEOPLE ***

This file should be named 6168.txt or 6168.zip

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain

medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
