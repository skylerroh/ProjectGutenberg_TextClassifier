BIOGRAPHIES


COOK, ELIZA, was born in London, England, in the year 1817, and was
  the most popular poetess of her day. When a young girl, she gave herself
  so completely up to reading that her father threatened to burn her
  books. She began to write at an early age, and contributed poems and
  essays to various periodicals. She is the author of many poems that will
  live. She died in 1889.

COWPER, WILLIAM, is one of the most eminent and popular of all
  English poets. He was born in the year 1731. His mother dying when he
  was only six years old, the child was sent away from home to boarding
  school, where he suffered so much from the cruelty of a bigger boy that
  he was obliged to leave that school for another. At the completion of
  his college course he expressed regrets that his education was not
  received in a school where he could be taught his duty to God. "I have
  been graduated," he writes, "but I understand neither the law nor the
  gospel." His longest poem is "The Task," upon which his reputation as a
  poet chiefly depends. He died in the year 1800.

DICKENS, CHARLES, one of the greatest and most popular of the
  novelists of England, was born in 1812. By hard, persistent work he
  raised himself from obscurity and poverty to fame and fortune. After
  only two years of schooling he was obliged to go to work. His first job
  was pasting labels on blacking-pots, for which he received twenty-five
  cents a day! He next became office boy in a lawyer's office, and then
  reporter for a London daily paper. He learned shorthand by himself from
  a book he found in a public reading-room. In 1841, and again in 1867, he
  lectured in America. He died suddenly in 1870, and is buried in
  Westminster Abbey.

DONNELLY, ELEANOR CECILIA, began to write verses when she was but
  eight years old. Her early education was directed by her mother, a
  gifted and accomplished lady. Her pen has ever been devoted to the cause
  of Catholic truth and the elevation of Catholic literature. Besides
  hundreds of charming stories and essays, she has published several
  volumes of poems. Her writings on sacred subjects display a strong,
  intelligent faith, and a tender piety. She is a writer whose pathos,
  originality, grace of diction, sweetness of rhythm, purity of sentiment,
  and sublimity of thought entitle her to rank among the first of our
  American poets. Miss Donnelly has lived all her life in her native city
  of Philadelphia, where she is the center of a cultured circle of
  admiring friends, and where she edifies all by the practice of every
  Christian virtue and by a life of devotedness to the honor and glory of
  Almighty God.

GOULD, HANNAH F., an American poetess, has written many pleasant
  poems for children. "Jack Frost" and "The Winter King" have long been
  favorites. She was born in Vermont in the year 1789, and died in 1865.

HAWTHORNE, NATHANIEL, was born in Salem, Mass., on July 4, 1804.
  When still quite young he showed a great fondness for reading. At the
  early age of six his favorite book was Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress." At
  college he was a classmate of Longfellow. Among his writings are a
  number of stories for children: "The Tanglewood Tales," "The
  Snow-Image," "The Wonder Books," and some stories of American history.
  His volumes of short stories charm old and young alike. His Book, "The
  Scarlet Letter," has made him famous. It was while he lived at Lenox,
  Mass., among the Berkshire Hills, that he published "The House of the
  Seven Gables." He visited Italy in 1857, where he began "The Marble
  Faun," which is considered his greatest novel. He died in 1864, and is
  buried in Concord, Mass. Hawthorne possessed a delicate and exquisite
  humor, and a marvelous felicity in the use of language. His style may be
  said to combine almost every excellence--elegance, simplicity, grace,
  clearness and force.

HAYNE, PAUL HAMILTON, an American poet, was born in South Carolina
  in the year 1831. In 1854 he published a volume of poems. His death
  occurred in 1886. He was a descendant of the American patriot, Isaac
  Hayne, who, at the siege of Charleston in 1780, fell into the hands of
  the British, and was hanged by them because he refused to join their
  ranks and fight against his country.

HOLLAND, JOSIAH GILBERT, a popular American author who wrote under
  the assumed name of _Timothy Titcomb,_ was born in Massachusetts in the
  year 1819. He began life as a physician, but after a few years of
  practice gave up his profession and went to Vicksburg, Miss., as
  Superintendent of Schools. He wrote a number of novels and several
  volumes of essays. In 1870 he became editor of _Scribner's Magazine._ He
  died in 1881.

HUNT, LEIGH, editor, essayist, critic, and poet, and an intimate
  friend of Byron, Moore, Keats, and Shelley, was born near London,
  England, in 1784, and died in 1859.

JACKSON, HELEN HUNT, a noted American writer of prose and poetry,
  and known for years by her pen name of "H.H." (the initials of her
  name), was born in Massachusetts in the year 1831. She is the author of
  many charming poems, short stories, and novels. Read her "Bits of Talk"
  and "Bits of Travel." She lived some years in Colorado, where her life
  brought to her notice the wrongs done the Indians. In their defense she
  wrote "A Century of Dishonor," The last book she wrote is "Ramona," an
  Indian romance, which she hoped would do for the Indian what "Uncle
  Tom's Cabin" had done for the slave. Mrs. Jackson died in California in
  1885.

"MERCEDES" is the pen name of an able, zealous, and devoted Sister
  of one of our great Teaching Communities. She has written several
  excellent "Plays" for use in Convent Schools which have met the test of
  successful production. Her "Wild Flowers from the Mountain-side" is a
  volume of Poems and Dramas that exhibit "the heart and soul and faith of
  true poetry." A competent critic calls these "Wild Flowers sweet, their
  hues most delicate, their fragrance most agreeable." Mercedes has also
  enriched the columns of _The Missionary_ and other publications with
  several true stories, in attractive prose, of edifying conversions
  resulting from the missionary zeal of priest and teacher. Her graceful
  pen is ever at the service of every cause tending to the glory of God
  and the good of souls.

MOORE, THOMAS, was born in the city of Dublin, Ireland, in the year
  1779, and was educated at Trinity College. His matchless "Melodies" are
  the delight of all lovers of music, and are sung all over the world.
  Archbishop McHale of Tuam translated them into the grand old Celtic
  tongue. Moore is the greatest of Ireland's song-writers, and one of the
  world's greatest. As a poet few have equaled him in the power to write
  poetry which charms the ear by its delightful cadence. His lines display
  an exquisite harmony, and are perfectly adapted to the thoughts which
  they express and inspire. His grave is in England, where he spent the
  later years of his life, and where he died in 1852. In 1896, the Moore
  Memorial Committee of Dublin erected over his grave a monument
  consisting of a magnificent and beautiful Celtic cross.

MOORE, CLEMENT C., poet and teacher, was born in New York in 1779.
  In 1821 he was appointed professor in a Seminary founded by his father,
  who was Bishop Benjamin Moore of the Protestant Episcopal diocese of New
  York. He died in 1863.

MORRIS, GEORGE P., poet and journalist, wrote several popular
  poems, but is remembered chiefly for his songs and ballads. He was born
  in Philadelphia in the year 1802, and died in New York in 1864.

MCCARTHY, DENIS ALOYSIUS, poet, lecturer and journalist, was born
  in Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, Ireland, in the year 1871, and
  made his elementary and intermediate studies in the Christian Brothers'
  School of his native town. Since his arrival in America in 1886, he has
  published two volumes of poems which he modestly calls "A Round of
  Rimes" and "Voices from Erin." "His poetry," says a distinguished critic
  who is neither Irish nor Catholic, "is soulful and sweet, and sings
  itself into the heart of anyone who has a bit of sentiment in his
  make-up." Mr. McCarthy is at present Associate Editor of the _Sacred
  Heart Review_ of Boston. He lectures on literary and Irish themes, and
  contributes poems, stories, essays, book reviews, etc., to various
  papers and magazines.

NEWMAN, CARDINAL JOHN HENRY, was born in London in 1801, and
  studied at Trinity College, Oxford. In 1824 he became a minister of the
  Church of England, and rose rapidly in his profession. In 1845 he
  abandoned the English ministry, renounced the errors of Protestantism,
  and entered the Catholic Church, of which he remained till death a most
  faithful, devoted, and zealous son. He was ordained priest in 1848, was
  made Rector of the Catholic University of Dublin in 1854, and in 1879
  was raised to the rank of Cardinal by Pope Leo XIII. Cardinal Newman's
  writings are beyond the grasp of young minds, yet they will profit by
  and enjoy the perusal of his two great novels, "Loss and Gain" and
  "Callista." The former is the story of a convert; the latter a tale of
  the third century, in which the beautiful heroine and martyr, Callista,
  is presented with a master's art. Newman is the greatest master of
  English prose. In this field he holds the same rank that Shakespeare
  does in English poetry. To his style, Augustine Birrell, a noted English
  essayist, pays the following graceful and eloquent tribute: "The charm
  of Dr. Newman's style baffles description. As well might one seek to
  analyze the fragrance of a flower, or to expound in words the jumping of
  one's heart when a beloved friend unexpectedly enters the room." This
  great Prince of the Church died the death of the saints in the year
  1890.

O'REILLY, JOHN BOYLE, patriot, author, poet and journalist, was
  born on the banks of the famous river Boyne, in County Meath, Ireland,
  in the year 1844. In 1860 he went over to England as agent of the Fenian
  Brotherhood, an organization whose purpose was the freedom of Ireland
  from English rule. In 1863 he joined the English army in order to sow
  the seeds of revolution among the soldiers. In 1866 he was arrested,
  tried for treason, and sentenced to death. This was afterwards commuted
  to twenty years' penal servitude. In 1867 he was transported to
  Australia to serve out his sentence, whence he escaped in 1869, and made
  his way to Philadelphia. He became editor of the Boston _Pilot_ in 1874.
  He is the author of "Songs from the Southern Seas," "Songs, Legends and
  Ballads," and of other works. He died in 1890. All through life the
  voice and pen of Boyle O'Reilly were at the service of his Church, his
  native land, and his adopted country. Kindness was the keynote of his
  character. In 1896 Boston erected in his honor a magnificent memorial
  monument.

RILEY, JAMES WHITCOMB, called the "Hoosier Poet," was born in
  Indiana in the year 1852. In many of his poems there is a strong sense
  of humor. What he writes comes from the heart and goes to the heart. He
  has written much in dialect. His home is in Indianapolis.

RUSKIN, JOHN, one of the most famous of English authors, was born
  in London in 1819, and educated at Oxford. He spent several years in
  Italy in the study of art. He wrote many volumes of essays and lectures,
  chiefly on matters connected with art and art criticism. In his writings
  we find many beautiful pen-pictures of statues and fine buildings and
  such things. His "Modern Painters," a treatise on art and nature,
  established his reputation as the greatest art critic of England. He
  died in 1900.

SANGSTER, MRS. MARGARET E., editor and poet, was born in New
  Rochelle, N.Y., on the 22d of February, 1838, and educated in Vienna.
  She has successfully edited such periodicals as _Hearth and Home,
  Harpers' Young People, and Harpers' Bazaar,_ in which much of her prose
  and poetry has appeared. She is at present (1909) the editor of _The
  Woman's Home Companion._

SOUTHEY, ROBERT, an eminent English poet and author, was born in
  the year 1774. He began to write verse at the age of ten. In 1792 he was
  expelled from the Westminster School for writing an essay against
  corporal punishment. He then entered one of the colleges of Oxford
  University, where he became an intimate friend of Coleridge. While
  residing at Lisbon he began a special study of Spanish and Portuguese
  literature. In 1813 he was appointed poet-laureate of England, and in
  1835 received a pension from the government. He died in 1843. Southey,
  Coleridge and Wordsworth are often called "The Lake Poets," because they
  lived together for years in the lake country of England, and in their
  writings described the scenery of that beautiful region.

TENNYSON, ALFRED, is considered the greatest poet of his age, and
  one of the great English poets of modern times. He was born in the year
  1809, and educated at Cambridge University. In 1850 he gave to the world
  "In Memoriam," his lament for the loss by death of his friend, Arthur H.
  Hallam. In 1851 he succeeded Wordsworth as poet-laureate of England. His
  poems, long and short, are general favorites. His "Idyls of the King,"
  "The Princess," "Maud," and "In Memoriam" are his chief long poems.
  These are remarkable for beauty of expression and richness of thought,
  of which Tennyson was master. He died in 1892, lamented by the entire
  English-speaking world, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Tennyson
  always loved the sea, the music of whose restless waves awakened an
  answering echo in his heart.

WALLACE, WILLIAM R., was born at Lexington, Ky., in the year 1819.
  As a poet he is best known as the author of "The Sword of Bunker Hill."

WESTWOOD, THOMAS, an English poet, was born in the year 1814, and
  died in 1888. He wrote several volumes of poetry, one of which was
  "Beads from a Rosary."

WHITTIER, JOHN G., called the "Quaker Poet," was born in
  Massachusetts in the year 1807. His parents were Quakers and were poor.
  When young he learned to make shoes, and with the money thus earned he
  paid his way at school. He was a boy of nineteen when his first verses
  were published. His poems were inspired by current events, and their
  patriotic spirit gives them a strong hold upon the public. "Snow-bound"
  is considered his greatest poem. Whittier loved home so much that he
  never visited a foreign country, and traveled but little in his own. He
  gave thirty of the best years of his life to the anti-slavery struggle.
  While other poets traveled in foreign lands or studied in their
  libraries, Whittier worked hard for the freedom of the slave. Of this he
  wrote--
         "Forego the dreams of lettered ease,
         Put thou the scholar's promise by;
         The rights of man are more than these."

  Mr. Whittier died in the year 1892.

WISEMAN, CARDINAL NICHOLAS PATRICK, was born in the year 1802 in
  Seville, Spain, of an Irish family settled there. His family returned to
  Ireland, where he was educated. When he was sixteen he entered the
  English College, Rome, and was ordained priest in 1825. In 1840 he was
  appointed Coadjutor Bishop, and in 1850 the Pope named him Archbishop of
  Westminster, and at the same time created him a Cardinal. He was a
  profound scholar, an eloquent preacher, and a brilliant writer, and is
  the author of many able works. He was one of the founders of the _Dublin
  Review._ He died in 1865. His "Fabiola or the Church of the Catacombs,"
  from which some selections have been taken for this Reader, is one of
  the classics of our language. It was written in 1854.

WOODWORTH, SAMUEL, editor and poet, was born in Massachusetts in
  1785, and died in 1842. With George P. Morris, he founded the _New York
  Mirror._ "The Old Oaken Bucket" is the best known of his poems.

  book, see the Third and the Fourth Reader of the series.
