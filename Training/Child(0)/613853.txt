READING  REVIEW.

Mamma', did you see the kitty catch the little mousie in the barn?

Yes, kitty spied the mousie running to and fro.

I saw her pretty black eyes glow, and soon she caught the mousie in her
paws.

What a pretty kitty she is! Her fur is like silk.

But look, mamma'! There is the man coming with his bear. May I go out to
see him?

Yes, Fred, but Frank must go with you.

How well the bear stands up on his hind legs!

Yes, and see how he holds the stick in his paws.

O see him dance! What funny things he does!  Where did the man get him,
Frank? Did you ask him?

Yes, and he said that one time, a long while ago, he and his dogs were
out hunting, and saw the bear up in a tree.

The bear was small then, so he was not afraid of him.

He cut the tree down, and as soon as it fell, the dogs caught the bear.

Did they hurt him, Frank?

No, the man did not let them hurt him.

See, Frank, the man is coming here.

How do you do, boys?

How do you do, sir?

We like to see your bear play. We think he likes you.

O yes! he likes me, for I always take good care of him.

John and his cat Dick do not like rats. They catch all they can.  One
time, John set a trap to catch some, and then went away and hid with
Dick.

Pretty soon a big rat came out of its hole and went to the trap.

Dick saw the rat, and made a start to get away from John. But John said,
"Hold on, Dick, let us see if it will go into the trap."

But the rat did not go in, and as it was going to run away, John let
Dick go, and said, "Catch it, Dick. Run quick, quick!" and they ran very
fast to catch the rat.

But the rat was too quick for them. It went into its hole just as Dick
was very near it.

Mary, where did you get your pretty redbirds?

Fred sent them to me.

Did he send the cage too?

No, mamma' gave me the cage.

What nice pets the birds will be! Are they tame, Mary?

Not yet, but I think they soon will be. They let me set food near them
now.

When they are tame, you can let them out of the cage.

What a funny cap one of them has!

It looks like a cap, Mary, but it is not. It is a crest.

Many redbirds have no crest, and I am glad that one of your birds has
one.

Will these birds sing well?

They sing very little. Redbirds are pretty, but they do not sing so well
as some other birds.

Look, mamma'! See what a pretty fish! It is a little trout.

Where did you get it, John?

Frank caught it in the brook.

I went to dip a dish into the brook to get some water, and saw this
little fish.
