Buying Food

The purchase of food is an important item of expense in operating a boys'
camp, large or small. If the camp is a large one, one hundred or more
boys, and you have a good-sized refrigerator and storehouse, always
purchase in bulk form from a wholesale firm. Canned goods, such as peas,
tomatoes, corn, and apples, buy in gallon cans in case lots and save cost
of extra tin and labels. Cocoa may be purchased in five-pound cans.
Condensed milk (unsweetened) in 20-ounce cans. Flour and sugar by the
barrel. Beans by the  bushel. Butter by the firkin[1]. For instance, a
good heavy 200-pound hind quarter of beef will furnish a roast beef
dinner, a steak breakfast, a meat stew supper, a meat hash breakfast, and
a good thick soup full of nourishment from the bones. The suet may be
rendered into lard. There will be no waste, and you get the very best of
meat. Buy lamb whole and fowl cleaned, and eggs by the crate. Keep an
accurate inventory, also the cost of foods. It will be found interesting
to make a resume of food at the end of each season, listing quantities,
costs, and amounts used each day and ascertain the actual cost per day for
each boy.

liters).]

The Steward

A reliable person should be in charge of the food supplies. In some camps
he is called the Steward. He will see that the supply is sufficient,
arrange the menus in consultation with the Chef, keep his storeroom neat
and scrupulously clean. As a matter of record and for the purpose of
ascertaining cost of feeding the boys, a number of camps keep a daily
record like the illustrated form.

The Cook

The cook is the keynote of happiness or unhappiness. Get a good cook,
professionally and morally, one who understands that he is not in camp for
a vacation. A capable cook will take care of fifty boys without any
assistance, except what help the boys may render in the preparation of
vegetables. For years two cooks have looked after the meals of 175 to 200
boys in the camps conducted each season by the writer. The wages of the
head cook or chef range from two to three dollars and fifty cents a day.
Some camps secure cooks from the hotels and restaurants, others from the
lumber camps. No matter where he is secured, be sure that he is clean, in
person, in habits, and in speech. Do not permit boys to loaf  about the
kitchen. In the planning of menus, food value and variety must be
considered. The following represents the staple articles of food for a
boys' camp.

should be plenty of milk to drink, and good bread and butter. Cake and
fancy dishes are not necessary. The bill of fare should be an elastic one.
When the day is cold and dreary, hot chowders, soups, cocoa, etc., should
be served.

On a warm day, lemonade and cold dishes are desirable. Every camp should,
if possible, have its own ice-cream freezer, as ice-creams, sherbets, and
water ices are not only healthy but inexpensive. An occasional delicacy is
desirable. Canned shredded pineapple, strawberries and sliced peaches make
excellent sherbets and ice cream. In one camp chicken and ice cream are
served every Sunday dinner.

Serving

Each table is provided with meat platter, vegetable dishes, bread plate,
butter dish, sugar bowl, milk pitcher, water pitcher, salt and pepper
shakers, etc. The only need of a waiter is to bring the food to the tables
and replenish the dishes. Each boy takes his turn at waiting. If there are
seven boys in a tent, a boy serves one day in seven. He usually sits at
the right side of the leader and eats his meal with the others.  This does
away with a second or "waiter" table. By this system you avoid the
tendency to smartness and roughness. Each leader is careful to see that
food is not wasted at his table, that decency and order is preserved, and
wholesome conversation and pleasantries indulged in during the meal, as an
aid to good digestion.

Dishwashing

Some camps pay for all work done and give boys more freedom, but
experience has clearly proven that the successful camp is the one where
boys all have responsibility and definite duties to perform. Dishwashing
is never attractive. It may be made less irksome by carefully
systematizing the work. There are several ways. One way is that of having
each boy wash his own dishes, working a tent at a time. A number of tubs
of hot, soapy water are provided for washing, and several extra tubs
filled with very hot water for rinsing. At a signal from the Camp Director
or person in charge, each table of boys by rotation passes from the dining
room with the dishes to these tubs and each boy proceeds to do his own
dishwashing and rinsing and drying. Another way is to provide two
good-sized dish-pans for each table, and assign two boys to do the
dish-washing for the day. The dishes are washed at the tables and stowed
away in a closet, each table having its own closet. Another way is to
purchase a good dish-washing machine, like that made by the Fearless
Dishwashing Co., Rochester, N. Y. (Cost, $100), and install it in the
kitchen. This plan is in operation at Camp Dudley and Camp Hayo-Went-Ha.

[Illustration: Camp Hayo-Went-Ha dishwashing]

Cleanliness must be insisted upon. Never leave anything unwashed until it
is used again. The eating from dirty and greasy plates, forks, knives, and
spoons will result in disease. No matter what system you use, do not let
down on dirty dishes.

A FEW HINTS

Soup

"Soup makes the soldier," said Napoleon I. Bones should never be thrown
away, but cracked and placed in stock pot, covered with water and let
simmer. This makes "stock" which is the foundation of all soup.

All green vegetables should be washed well in cold water and put in
boiling salted water, and boiled slowly until tender. All white and
underground vegetables should be cooked in boiling unsalted water, the
salt being added at the last moment.
