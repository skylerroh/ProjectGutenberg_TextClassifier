THE BIRTHDAY PARTY.

I.


Flora Lee's birthday came in July. Her mother wished very
much to celebrate the occasion in a proper manner. Flora was
a good girl, and her parents were always glad to do any
thing they could to please her, and to increase her
happiness.

They were very indulgent parents, and as they had plenty of
money, they could afford to pay well for a "good time." Yet
they were not weak and silly in their indulgence. As much as
they loved their little daughter, they did not give her pies
and cakes to eat when they thought such articles would hurt
her.

They did not let her lie in bed till noon because they loved
her, or permit her to do any thing that would injure her,
either in body or mind. Flora always went to church, and to
the Sunday school, and never cried to stay at home. If she
had cried, it would have made no difference, for her father
and mother meant to have her do right, whether she liked it
or not.

But Flora gave them very little trouble about such matters.
Her parents knew best what was good for her, and she was
willing in all things to obey them. It was for this reason
that they were so anxious to please her, even at the expense
of a great deal of time and money.

The birthday of Flora came on Wednesday, and school did not
keep in the afternoon. All the children, therefore, could
attend the party which they intended to give in honor of the
day.

About a week before the time, Mrs. Lee told Flora she might
have the party, and wanted her to make out a list of all the
children whom she wished to invite.
