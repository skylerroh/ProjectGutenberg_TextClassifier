  The turbaned TURK'S HEAD in his pride.

  Fair BETHLEHEM' STAR shineth bright,
  In a lowly place, as of old,

[Illustration]

  And through the green gloom glows the light
  Of ST. JOHN'S-WORT--a nimbus of gold.

[Illustration]

  But the hours of the sun swift glide,
  And the flowers with them are speeding.

[Illustration]

  Though LOVE-IN-A-MIST may hide.
  When Time's in the garden weeding.

[Illustration]

  There's TRAVELLER'S JOY
  To entwine,
  At our journey's end for greeting,

[Illustration]

  We can talk over SOPS-IN-WINE,
  And drink to our next merry meeting.
