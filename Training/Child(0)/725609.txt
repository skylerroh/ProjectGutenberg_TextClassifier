
    Under grass alone he lies,
    Looking up with leaden eyes,
    Scarlet coat and pointed gun,
    To the stars and to the sun.

    When the grass is ripe like grain,
    When the scythe is stoned again,
    When the lawn is shaven clear,
    Then my hole shall reappear.

    I shall find him, never fear,
    I shall find my grenadier;
    But for all that's gone and come,
    I shall find my soldier dumb.

    He has lived, a little thing,
    In the grassy woods of spring;
    Done, if he could tell me true,
    Just as I should like to do.

    He has seen the starry hours
    And the springing of the flowers;
    And the fairy things that pass
    In the forests of the grass.

    In the silence he has heard
    Talking bee and ladybird,
    And the butterfly has flown
    O'er him as he lay alone.

    Not a word will he disclose,
    Not a word of all he knows.
    I must lay him on the shelf,
    And make up the tale myself.

AUTUMN FIRES


    In the other gardens
      And all up the vale,
    From the autumn bonfires
      See the smoke trail!

    Pleasant summer over
      And all the summer flowers,
    The red fire blazes,
      The grey smoke towers.

    Sing a song of seasons!
      Something bright in all!
    Flowers in the summer,
      Fires in the fall!

THE GARDENER


    The gardener does not love to talk,
    He makes me keep the gravel walk;
    And when he puts his tools away,
    He locks the door and takes the key.

    Away behind the currant row,
    Where no one else but cook may go,
    Far in the plots, I see him dig,
    Old and serious, brown and big.

    He digs the flowers, green, red, and blue,
    Nor wishes to be spoken to.
    He digs the flowers and cuts the hay,
    And never seems to want to play.

    Silly gardener! summer goes,
    And winter comes with pinching toes,
    When in the garden bare and brown
    You must lay your barrow down.

    Well now, and while the summer stays,
    To profit by these garden days
    O how much wiser you would be
    To play at Indian wars with me!

HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS


    Dear Uncle Jim, this garden ground
    That now you smoke your pipe around.
    Has seen immortal actions done
    And valiant battles lost and won.

    Here we had best on tip-toe tread,
    While I for safety march ahead,
    For this is that enchanted ground
    Where all who loiter slumber sound.

    Here is the sea, here is the sand,
    Here is simple Shepherd's Land,
    Here are the fairy hollyhocks,
    And there are Ali Baba's rocks.

    But yonder, see! apart and high,
    Frozen Siberia lies; where I,
    With Robert Bruce and William Tell,
    Was bound by an enchanter's spell.




ENVOYS

TO WILLIE AND HENRIETTA


        If two may read aright
        These rhymes of old delight
        And house and garden play,
    You too, my cousins, and you only, may.

        You in a garden green
        With me were king and queen,
        Were hunter, soldier, tar,
    And all the thousand things that children are.

        Now in the elders' seat
        We rest with quiet feet,
        And from the window-bay
    We watch the children, our successors, play.

        "Time was," the golden head
        Irrevocably said;
        But time which none can bind,
    While flowing fast away, leaves love behind.

TO MY MOTHER


    You too, my mother, read my rhymes
    For love of unforgotten times,
    And you may chance to hear once more
    The little feet along the floor.

TO AUNTIE


    _Chief of our aunts_--not only I,
    But all your dozen of nurselings cry--
    _What did the other children do?_
    _And what were childhood, wanting you?_

TO MINNIE


    The red room with the giant bed
    Where none but elders laid their head;
    The little room where you and I
    Did for awhile together lie
    And, simple suitor, I your hand
    In decent marriage did demand;
    The great day nursery, best of all,
    With pictures pasted on the wall
    And leaves upon the blind
    A pleasant room wherein to wake
    And hear the leafy garden shake
    And rustle in the wind--
    And pleasant there to lie in bed
    And see the pictures overhead--
    The wars about Sebastopol,
    The grinning guns along the wall,
    The daring escalade,
    The plunging ships, the bleating sheep,
    The happy children ankle-deep
    And laughing as they wade;
    All these are vanished clean away,
    And the old manse is changed to-day;
    It wears an altered face
    And shields a stranger race.
    The river, on from mill to mill,
    Flows past our childhood's garden still;
    But ah! we children never more
    Shall watch it from the water-door.
    Below the yew--it still is there--
    Our phantom voices haunt the air
    As we were still at play,
    And I can hear them call and say:
    "_How far is it to Babylon?_"

    Ah, far enough, my dear,
    Far, far enough from here--
    Yet you have farther gone!
    "_Can I get there by candlelight?_"
    So goes the old refrain.
    I do not know--perchance you might--
    But only, children, hear it right,
    Ah, never to return again!
    The eternal dawn, beyond a doubt,
    Shall break on hill and plain,
    And put all stars and candles out
    Ere we be young again.

    To you in distant India, these
    I send across the seas,
    Nor count it far across.
    For which of us forgets
    The Indian cabinets,
    The bones of antelope, the wings of albatross,
    The pied and painted birds and beans,
    The junks and bangles, beads and screens,
    The gods and sacred bells,
    And the loud-humming, twisting shells!
    The level of the parlour floor
    Was honest, homely, Scottish shore;
    But when we climbed upon a chair,
    Behold the gorgeous East was there!
    Be this a fable; and behold
    Me in the parlour as of old,
    And Minnie just above me set
    In the quaint Indian cabinet!
    Smiling and kind, you grace a shelf
    Too high for me to reach myself.
    Reach down a hand, my dear, and take
    These rhymes for old acquaintance' sake!

TO MY NAME-CHILD


                                 1

    Some day soon this rhyming volume, if you learn with proper speed,
    Little Louis Sanchez, will be given you to read.
    Then shall you discover, that your name was printed down
    By the English printers, long before, in London town.

    In the great and busy city where the East and West are met,
    All the little letters did the English printer set;
    While you thought of nothing, and were still too young to play,
    Foreign people thought of you in places far away.

    Ay, and while you slept, a baby, over all the English lands
    Other little children took the volume in their hands;
