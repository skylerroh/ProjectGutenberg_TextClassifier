PREFACE

The first part of this new volume of the _American Fights and Fighters
Series_ needs no special introduction.  Partly to make this the same
size as the other books, but more particularly because I especially
desired to give a permanent place to some of the most dramatic and
interesting episodes in our history--especially as most of them related
to the Pacific and the Far West--the series of papers in part second
was included.

"The Yarn of the _Essex_, Whaler" is abridged from a quaint account
written by the Mate and published in an old volume which is long since
out of print and very scarce.  The papers on the _Tonquin_, John Paul
Jones, and "The Great American Duellists" speak for themselves.  The
account of the battle of the Pitt River has never been published in
book form heretofore.  The last paper "On Being a Boy Out West" I
inserted because I enjoy it myself, and because I have found that
others young and old who have read it generally like it also.

Thanks are due and are hereby extended to the following magazines for
permission to republish various articles which originally appeared in
their pages: _Harper's_, _Munseys_, _The Cosmopolitan_, _Sunset_ and
_The New Era_.

I project another volume of the Series supplementing the two Indian
volumes immediately preceding this one, but the information is hard to
get, and the work amid many other demands upon my time, proceeds slowly.

I. The Spanish Main

One of the commonly misunderstood phrases in the language is "the
Spanish Main."  To the ordinary individual it suggests the Caribbean
Sea.  Although Shakespeare in "Othello," makes one of the gentlemen of
Cyprus say that he "cannot 'twixt heaven and main descry a sail," and,
therefore, with other poets, gives warrant to the application of the
word to the ocean, "main" really refers to the other element.  The
Spanish Main was that portion of South American territory distinguished
from Cuba, Hispaniola and the other islands, because it was on the main
land.

When the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea were a Spanish lake, the
whole circle of territory, bordering thereon was the Spanish Main, but
of late the title has been restricted to Central and South America.
The buccaneers are those who made it famous.  So the word brings up
white-hot stories of battle, murder and sudden death.

The history of the Spanish Main begins in 1509, with the voyages of
Ojeda and Nicuesa, which were the first definite and authorized
attempts to colonize the mainland of South America.

The honor of being the first of the fifteenth-century {4} navigators to
set foot upon either of the two American continents, indisputably
