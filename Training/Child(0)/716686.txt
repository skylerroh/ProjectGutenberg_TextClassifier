             as swearing and cursing"?
    I wish I hadn't been so cross with poor Mary, and I wish I hadn't given
             so much trouble about my medicine and my food.
    I didn't think about her. I only thought what a bother it was. I wish
             I hadn't thought so much about being miserable, that I never
             thought of trying to be good.
    I believe the Sea-captain is right, and I shall tell him so to-morrow,
             when he comes here to tea;
    He's going to look at my blackbird's leg, and if it is really set, he
             wants me to let it go free.
    He says captivity is worse than convalescence, and so I should think
             it must be.
    Are you tired, little Sister? You feel shaky. Don't beg my pardon; I
             beg yours. I've not let you go out of my sight for weeks.
             Get your things on, and have a gallop on Jack.
    Ride round this way and let me see you. I won't say a word about
             wishing I was going too; and if my head gets bad whilst
             you're away, I will bear it my very best till you come back.
    Tell me one thing before you start. If I learn to be patient, shall I
             learn to be brave, do you think? The Sea-captain says so.
    He says, "Self-command is the making of a man," and he's a finely-made
             man himself, so he ought to know.
    Perhaps, if I try hard at Convalescence now, I may become a brave
             sea-captain hereafter, and take my beautiful ship into battle,
             and bring her out again with flying colours and fame,
    If the courage that dares, and the courage that bears, _are_ really
             one and the same.

    THE ADVENTURES OF AN ELF.

    A PICTURE POEM FOR THE LITTLE ONES.

    _By Fedor Flinzer. Freely translated by J.H. Ewing._


    I.

    Dear children, listen whilst I tell
    What to a certain Elf befell,
    Who left his house and sallied forth
    Adventure seeking, south and north,
    And west and east, by path and field,
    Resolved to conquer or to yield.
    A thimble on his back he carried,
    With a rose-twig his foes he parried.

    [Illustration]


    II.

    It was a sunny, bright, spring day,
    When to the wood he took his way;
    He knew that in a certain spot
    A Bumble Bee his nest had got.
    The Bee was out, the chance was good,
    But just when grabbing all he could,
    He heard the Bee behind him humming,
    And only wished he'd heard him coming!

    [Illustration]


    III.

    In terror turned the tiny man,
    And now a famous fight began:
    The Bee flew round, and buzzed and stung,
    The Elf his prickly rose-staff swung.
    Now fiercely here, now wildly there,
    He hit the Bee or fought the air.
    At last one weighty blow descended:
    The Bee was dead--the fight was ended.

    [Illustration]


    IV.

    Exhausted quite, he took a seat.
    The honey tasted doubly sweet!
    The thimble-full had been upset,
    But still there were a few drops yet.
    He licked his lips and blessed himself,
    That he was such a lucky Elf,
    And now might hope to live in clover;
    But, ah! his troubles were not over!

    [Illustration]


    V.

    For at that instant, by his side,
    A beast of fearful form he spied:
    At first he thought it was a bear,
    And headlong fell in dire despair.
    He lost one slipper in the moss,
    And this was not his only loss.
    With paws and snout the beast was nimble,
    And very soon cleared out the thimble.

    [Illustration]


    VI.

    This rifling of his honey-pot
    Awoke our Elfin's wrath full hot.
    He made a rope of linden bast,
    By either end he held it fast,
    And creeping up behind the beast,
    Intent upon the honey feast,
    Before it had the slightest inkling,
    The rope was round it in a twinkling.

    [Illustration]


    VII.

    The mouse shrieked "Murder!" "Fire!" and "Thieves!"
    And struggled through the twigs and leaves.
    It pulled the reins with all its might,
    Our hero only drew them tight.
    Upon the mouse's back he leapt,
    And like a man his seat he kept.
    His steed was terribly affrighted,
    But he himself was much delighted.

    [Illustration]


    VIII.

    "Gee up, my little horse!" he cried,
    "I mean to have a glorious ride;
    So bear me forth with lightning speed,
    A Knight resolved on doughty deed.
    The wide world we will gallop round,
    And clear the hedges at one bound."
    The mouse set off, the hero bantered,
    And out into the world they cantered.

    [Illustration]


    IX.

    At last they rode up to an inn:
    "Good Mr. Host, pray who's within?"
    "My daughter serves the customers,
    Before the fire the Tom-cat purrs."
    For further news they did not wait--
    The mouse sprang through the garden-gate--
    They fled without a look behind them.
    The question is--Did Thomas find them?




    SONGS FOR MUSIC




    SERENADE.


    I would not have you wake for me,
      Fair lady, though I love you!
    And though the night is warm, and all
      The stars are out above you;
    And though the dew's so light it could
      Not hurt your little feet,
    And nightingales in yonder wood
      Are singing passing sweet.

    Yet may my plaintive strain unite
      And mingle with your dreaming,
    And through the visions of the night
      Just interweave my seeming.
    Yet no! sleep on with fancy free
      In that untroubled breast;
    No song of mine, no thought of me,
      Deserves to break your rest!




    MAIDEN WITH THE GIPSY LOOK.


    Maiden with the gipsy look,
    Dusky locks and russet hue,
    Open wide thy Sybil's book,
    Tell my fate and tell it true;
    Shall I live? or shall I die?
    Timely wed, or single be?
    Maiden with the gipsy eye,
    Read my riddle unto me!

    Maiden with the gipsy face,
    If thou canst not tell me all,
    Tell me thus much, of thy grace,
    Should I climb, or fear to fall?
    Should I dare, or dread to dare?
    Should I speak, or silent be?
    Maiden with the gipsy hair,
    Read my riddle unto me!

    Maiden with the gipsy hair,
    Deep into thy mirror look,
    See my love and fortune there,
    Clearer than in Sybil's book:
    Let me cross thy slender palm,
    Let me learn my fate from thee;
    Maiden with the gipsy charm,
    Read my riddle unto me.




    AH! WOULD I COULD FORGET.


    The whispering water rocks the reeds,
    And, murmuring softly, laps the weeds;
    And nurses there the falsest bloom
    That ever wrought a lover's doom.
      Forget me not! Forget me not!
        Ah! would I could forget!
      But, crying still, "Forget me not,"
        Her image haunts me yet.

    We wander'd by the river's brim,
    The day grew dusk, the pathway dim;
    Her eyes like stars dispell'd the gloom,
    Her gleaming fingers pluck'd the bloom.
      Forget me not! Forget me not!
        Ah! would I could forget!
      But, crying still, "Forget me not,"
        Her image haunts me yet.

    The pale moon lit her paler face,
    And coldly watch'd our last embrace,
    And chill'd her tresses' sunny hue,
    And stole that flower's turquoise blue.
      Forget me not! Forget me not!
        Ah! would I could forget!
      But, crying still, "Forget me not,"
        Her image haunts me yet.

    The fateful flower droop'd to death,
    The fair, false maid forswore her faith;
    But I obey a broken vow,
    And keep those wither'd blossoms now!
      Forget me not! Forget me not!
        Ah! would I could forget!
      But, crying still, "Forget me not,"
        Her image haunts me yet.

    Sweet lips that pray'd--"Forget me not!"
    Sweet eyes that will not be forgot!
    Recall your prayer, forego your power,
    Which binds me by the fatal flower.
      Forget me not! Forget me not!
        Ah! would I could forget!
      But, crying still, "Forget me not,"
        Her image haunts me yet.




    MADRIGAL.


    Life is full of trouble,
      Love is full of care,
    Joy is like a bubble
      Shining in the air,
        For you cannot
      Grasp it anywhere.

    Love is not worth getting,
      It doth fade so fast.
    Life is not worth fretting
      Which so soon is past;
        And you cannot
      Bid them longer last.

    Yet for certain fellows
      Life seems true and strong;
    And with some, they tell us,
      Love will linger long;
        Thus they cannot
      Understand my song.




    THE ELLEREE.[7]

    A SONG OF SECOND SIGHT.


    Elleree! O Elleree!
    Seeing what none else may see,
    Dost thou see the man in grey?
    Dost thou hear the night hounds bay?
      Elleree! O Elleree!
    Seventh son of seventh son,
    All thy thread of life is spun,
    Thy little race is nearly run,
      And death awaits for thee!

    Elleree! O Elleree!
    Coronach shall wail for thee;
    Get thee shrived and get thee blest,
    Get thee ready for thy rest,
      Elleree! O Elleree!
    That thou owest quickly give,
    What thou ownest thou must leave,
    And those thou lovest best shall grieve,
      But all in vain for thee!

    "Bodach Glas!"[8] the chieftain said,
    "All my debts but one are paid,
    All I love have long been dead,
    All my hopes on Heaven are stay'd,
      Death to me can bring no dole;"
    Thus the Elleree replied;--
    But with ebbing of the tide
    As sinks the setting sun he died;--
      May Christ receive his soul!

    [Footnote 7: "Elleree" is the name of one who has the gift of second
    sight.]

    [Footnote 8: "Bodach Glas," the Man in Grey, appears to a Highland
    family with the gift of second sight, presaging death.]




    OTHER STARS.


    The night is dark, and yet it is not quite:
      Those stars are hid that other orbs may shine;
    Twin stars, whose rays illuminate the night,
      And cheer her gloom, but only deepen mine;
        For these fair stars are not what they do seem,
        But vanish'd eyes remember'd in a dream.

    The night is dark, and yet it brings no rest;
      Those eager eyes gaze on and banish sleep;
    Though flaming Mars has lower'd his crimson crest,
      And weary Venus pales into the deep,
        These two with tender shining mock my woe
        From out the distant heaven of long ago.

    The night is dark, and yet how bright they gleam!
      Oh! empty vision of a vanish'd light!
    Sweet eyes! must you for ever be a dream
      Deep in my heart, and distant from my sight?
        For could you shine as once you shone before,
        The stars might hide their rays for evermore!




    FADED FLOWERS.


    My love she sent a flower to me
    Of tender hue and fragrance rare,
    And with it came across the sea
    A letter kind as she was fair;
    But when her letter met mine eyes,
    The flower, the little flower, was dead:
    And ere I touched the tender prize
    The hues were dim, the fragrance fled.

    I sent my love a letter too,
    In happy hope no more to roam;
    I bade her bless the vessel true
    Whose gallant sails should waft me home.
    But ere my letter reach'd her hand,
    My love, my little love, was dead,
    And when the vessel touch'd the land,
    Fair hope for evermore had fled.




    SPEED WELL.


    What time I left my native land,
      And bade farewell to my true love,
    She laid a flower in my hand
      As azure as the sky above.
        "Speed thee well! Speed well!"
      She softly whispered, "Speed well!
          This flower blue
          Be token true
      Of my true heart's true love for you!"

    Its tender hue is bright and pure,
      As heav'n through summer clouds doth show,
    A pledge though clouds thy way obscure,
      It shall not be for ever so.
        "Speed thee well! Speed well!"
      She softly whisper'd, "Speed well!
          This flower blue
          Be token true
      Of my true heart's true love for you!"

    And as I toil through help and harm,
      And whilst on alien shores I dwell,
    I wear this flower as a charm,
      My heart repeats that tender spell:
        "Speed thee well! Speed well!"
      It softly whispers, "Speed well!
          This flower blue
          Be token true
    Of my true heart's true love for you!"




    HOW MANY YEARS AGO?


    How many years ago, love,
      Since you came courting me?
    Through oak-tree wood and o'er the lea,
