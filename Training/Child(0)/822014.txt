  Peter, popper, dopper, Dan,
  Catch a moonbeam if you can;
  Climb a cedar ten feet high
  And pick the planets from the sky.
  You're a wonder, little man--
  Peter, popper, dopper, Dan.




  OLD FATHER ANNUM


  Old Father Annum on New Year's Day
  Picked up his bag of months and years,
  Thrust in his hand in a careless way,
  And pulled a wee fellow out by the ears.
  "There you are," said he to the waiting crowd,
  "He's as good as any I have in my pack.
  I never can tell, but I hope to be proud
  Of the little rascal when I come back."

  THE TIPPANY FLOWER


  O what will you take for a tippany flower,
  And what will you take for a pansy?
  I'll take a smile for the tippany flower,
  And a kiss for the pretty pansy.

  HERE COMES A CABBAGE


  Here comes a cabbage with a bonnet on its head,
  A pretty purple bonnet with a bow of blue and red;
  And here comes a bottle with a collar 'round its neck,
  A handsome linen collar, too, without a spot or speck;
  Next comes a meat-saw, his job is biting beef,
  And according to the cleaver he has gold in all his teeth;
  And last of all there comes along, amid the ringing cheers,
  A princely Indian corn-stalk with rings in both his ears.




  [Illustration]

  PLENTY


  There are plenty feathers on a hen
  And prickers on a rose,
  There is plenty roaring in a den
  Of lions, goodness knows;

  There are plenty fishes in the lake
  And islands in the sea;
  There are plenty raisins in this cake
  For even you and me.




  THE RUNAWAYS


  A pipe and a spoon and a tenpenny nail
  Stole a tin dishpan and went for a sail.
  But the cook he grew curious,
  Fussy, and furious;
  Gathered his trappings, and went on their trail.
  He found them that night in a pitiful plight,
  And sent them all home on the ten o'clock mail.

  [Illustration: HI! HI! WHO WILL BUY A WEE LITTLE CLOUD]

  THE SALESMAN


  Hi! Hi! Who will buy
  A wee little cloud for the pretty blue sky?
  Some are purple, some are red,
  And all are soft as a feather bed.
  Hi! Little children, won't any one buy
  One little cloud for the pretty blue sky?




  A RACE, A RACE TO MOSCOW


  A race, a race to Moscow,
  Before the close of day!
  A race, a race to Moscow,
  A long, long way!
  First comes a butterfly a-riding on a frog,
  Next comes a water rat a-floating on a log;
  A caterpillar on the fence, a hopper in the hay--
  Who'll get to Moscow before the close of day?

  A PRINCE FROM PEPPERVILLE


  A prince came down from Pepperville
  In satin and in lace,
  He wore a bonnet on his head
  And whiskers on his face.

  And when he came to Battleburg
  This is what befell:
  He gave the king and cabinet
  A half a peanut shell.

  BOATS


  Hitch up your cattle
  And drive to Seattle
  To see all the boats come in,--
  From Kibi and Kobi
  And Panama Dobi
  And some from the Islands of Myn.
  They're bringing us rices
  And cocoa and spices
  And pineapples done up in tin,
  And maybe Aunt Dinah
  Will come back from China
  If ever the boats get in.




  PRETTY THINGS


  Pretty poppies,
  Pretty trees,
  Pretty little lettuce-leaves,
  Pretty pebbles,
  Red and brown,
  Pretty floating thistle-down.
  Pretty baby,
  Curly head,
  Standing in a pansy-bed,
  Pretty clouds
  All white and curled--
  O the great, big pretty world!

  [Illustration: PRETTY THINGS]




  DID YOU EVER?


  Did you ever go to the watering trough
  And watch the sparrows drink?
  Did you ever go to Potter's pond
  And see the divers sink?
  Did you ever steal to the barn at night
  And watch the hoot-owls think?

  HOOTEM, TOOTEM, CLEAR THE TRACK


  Hootem, tootem, clear the track!
  I caught a coon on Kamiak!
  Colonel Clapp and Uncle Rome
  Have hired a hack to bring it home.




  DOCTOR DRAKE


  On a hummock by the lake
  Stands the home of Doctor Drake,
  Poor old doctor, how he works!
  Week by week he never shirks--

  Pulling teeth for guinea-fowl,
  Soothing puppies when they howl,
  Whittling out a hickory peg
  For a gander's broken leg,

  Giving medicine away
  About a hundred times a day,
  Linseed oil and elder-bark
  To a croaking meadowlark,

  Nasty, bitter yarrow-tea
  To a tipsy bumble-bee,
  A poultice made of plantain leaves
  To cure a rabbit with the heaves.

  Fever, colic, cramp, or stitch,
  Kitten-croup or beaver's-itch,
  Any kind of pain or ache
  Is cured by dear, old Doctor Drake.




  [Illustration]

  BABIES


  Come to the land where the babies grow,
  Like flowers in the green, green grass.
  Tiny babes that swing and crow
  Whenever the warm winds pass,
  And laugh at their own bright eyes aglow
  In a fairy looking-glass.

  Come to the sea where the babies sail
  In ships of shining pearl,
  Borne to the west by a golden gale
  Of sun-beams all awhirl;
  And perhaps a baby brother will sail
  To you, my little girl.




  TWENTY THIEVES FROM ALBION


  Twenty thieves from Albion,
  All with butcher knives,
  Coming on the dead run,
  Fighting for their lives.

  See the man from our town.
  In a fancy vest,
  Knocking all the big ones down,
  Chasing all the rest.

  AS I CAME OUT OF GRUNDY GREET


  As I came out of Grundy Greet
  Four cats were marching down the street

  One was long and gray and thin
  With lots of whiskers on his chin,

  And one was round and sleek and fat
  (He must have been a butcher's cat).

  One was dapper, slight, and frail,
  With bells and tassels on his tail,

  And one had starey yellow eyes
  Almost as big as pumpkin pies.

  These four came marching down the street
  As I came out of Grundy Greet.
