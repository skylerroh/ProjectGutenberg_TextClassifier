     For best results, we recommend the following recipe changes
     when preparing these old-fashioned recipes. When using
     Pillsbury BEST(R) Flour, there is no need to sift the flour.
     Just lightly spoon the flour into the measuring cup and
     level it off. When combining the flour with other dry
     ingredients, stir the ingredients together with a fork.

     Bread: Soak 1 (.6 oz.) cake compressed yeast or 1 pkg.
     active dry yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in 2 tablespoons
     lukewarm (105-110 deg.F.) water for 2 minutes. Knead dough 5 to
     10 minutes. Let dough rise in warm place until it is _almost
     double in size_. Grease, bottom only, 8x4 or 9x5-inch loaf
     pan. Bake at 375 deg.F. for 35 to 40 minutes or until light
     golden brown.

     Biscuits: Bake on a lightly greased cookie sheet at 425 deg.F.
     for 9 to 11 minutes.

     Muffins: Bake in a greased 12-cup muffin pan at 400 deg.F. for
     12 to 16 minutes.

     Creamed Potatoes: If a double boiler is unavailable, cook in
     a heavy saucepan over medium heat until mixture thickens,
     about 5 minutes.

     Fudge: Cook in a small heavy saucepan; pour mixture into a
     buttered 9x5 or 8x4-inch pan.
