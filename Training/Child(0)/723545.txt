    On moonlit pillows lay three heads
      Bemused with dwarfish wine.

    A tomb of coral, the dirge of bee,
      The grey apes' guttural groan
    For Alliolyle, for Lallerie,
      For thee, O Muziomone!




    THE SLEEPING BEAUTY


    The scent of bramble sweets the air,
      Amid her folded sheets she lies,
    The gold of evening in her hair,
      The blue of morn shut in her eyes.

    How many a changing moon hath lit
      The unchanging roses of her face!
    Her mirror ever broods on it
      In silver stillness of the days.

    Oft flits the moth on filmy wings
      Into his solitary lair;
    Shrill evensong the cricket sings
      From some still shadow in her hair.

    In heat, in snow, in wind, in flood,
      She sleeps in lovely loneliness,
    Half folded like an April bud
      On winter-haunted trees.




    THE HORN


    Hark! is that a horn I hear,
      In cloudland winding sweet--
    And bell-like clash of bridle-rein,
      And silver-shod light feet?

    Is it the elfin laughter of
      Fairies riding faint and high,
    'Neath the branches of the moon,
      Straying through the starry sky?

    Is it in the globed dew
      Such sweet melodies may fall?
    Wood and valley--all are still,
      Hushed the shepherd's call.

    Hark! is that a horn I hear
      In cloudland winding sweet?
    Or gloomy goblins marching out
      Their captain Puck to greet?




    CAPTAIN LEAN


    Out of the East a hurricane
      Swept down on Captain Lean--
    That mariner and gentleman
      Will ne'er again be seen.

    He sailed his ship against the foes
      Of his own country dear,
    But now in the trough of the billows
      An aimless course doth steer.

    Powder was violets to his nostril,
      Sweet the din of the fighting-line,
    Now he is flotsam on the seas,
      And his bones are bleached with brine.

    The stars move up along the sky,
      The moon she shines so bright,
    And in that solitude the foam
      Sparkles unearthly white.

    This is the tomb of Captain Lean,
      Would a straiter please his soul?
    I trow he sleeps in peace,
      Howsoever the billows roll!




    THE PORTRAIT OF A WARRIOR


    His brow is seamed with line and scar;
      His cheek is red and dark as wine;
    The fires as of a Northern star
      Beneath his cap of sable shine.

    His right hand, bared of leathern glove,
      Hangs open like an iron gin,
    You stoop to see his pulses move,
      To hear the blood sweep out and in.

    He looks some king, so solitary
      In earnest thought he seems to stand,
    As if across a lonely sea
      He gazed impatient of the land.

    Out of the noisy centuries
      The foolish and the fearful fade;
    Yet burn unquenched these warrior eyes,
      Time hath not dimmed nor death dismayed.




    HAUNTED


    From out the wood I watched them shine,--
      The windows of the haunted house,
    Now ruddy as enchanted wine,
      Now dim as flittermouse.

    There went a thin voice piping airs
      Along the grey and crooked walks,--
    A garden of thistledown and tares,
      Bright leaves, and giant stalks.

    The twilight rain shone at its gates,
      Where long-leaved grass in shadow grew;
    And black in silence to her mates
      A voiceless raven flew.

    Lichen and moss the lone stones greened,
      Green paths led lightly to its door,
    Keen from her lair the spider leaned,
      And dusk to darkness wore.

    Amidst the sedge a whisper ran,
      The West shut down a heavy eye,
    And like last tapers, few and wan,
      The watch-stars kindled in the sky.




    THE RAVEN'S TOMB


    'Build me my tomb,' the Raven said,
    'Within the dark yew-tree,
    So in the Autumn yewberries
    Sad lamps may burn for me.
    Summon the haunted beetle,
    From twilight bud and bloom,
    To drone a gloomy dirge for me
    At dusk above my tomb.
    Beseech ye too the glowworm
    To bear her cloudy flame,
    Where the small, flickering bats resort,
    Whistling in tears my name.
    Let the round dew a whisper make,
    Welling on twig and thorn;
    And only the grey cock at night
    Call through his silver horn.
    And you, dear sisters, don your black
    For ever and a day,
    To show how sweet a raven
    In his tomb is laid away.'




    THE CHRISTENING


    The bells chime clear,
    Soon will the sun behind the hills sink down;
    Come, little Ann, your baby brother dear
    Lies in his christening-gown.

    His godparents
    Are all across the fields stepped on before,
    And wait beneath the crumbling monuments,
    This side the old church door.

    Your mammie dear
    Leans frail and lovely on your daddie's arm;
    Watching her chick, 'twixt happiness and fear,
    Lest he should come to harm.

    All to be blest
    Full soon in the clear heavenly water, he
    Sleeps on unwitting of't, his little breast
    Heaving so tenderly.

    I carried you,
    My little Ann, long since on this same quest,
    And from the painted windows a pale hue
    Lit golden on your breast;

    And then you woke,
    Chill as the holy water trickled down,
    And, weeping, cast the window a strange look,
    Half smile, half infant frown.

    I scarce could hear
    The larks a-singing in the green meadows,
    'Twas summertide, and budding far and near
    The hedges thick with rose.

    And now you're grown
    A little girl, and this same helpless mite
    Is come like such another bud half-blown,
    Out of the wintry night.

    Time flies, time flies!
    And yet, bless me! 'tis little changed am I;
    May Jesu keep from tears those infant eyes,
    Be love their lullaby!




    THE MOTHER BIRD


    Through the green twilight of a hedge
    I peered, with cheek on the cool leaves pressed,
    And spied a bird upon a nest:
    Two eyes she had beseeching me
    Meekly and brave, and her brown breast
    Throbb'd hot and quick above her heart;
    And then she oped her dagger bill,--
    'Twas not a chirp, as sparrows pipe
    At break of day; 'twas not a trill,
    As falters through the quiet even;
    But one sharp solitary note,
    One desperate, fierce, and vivid cry
    Of valiant tears, and hopeless joy,
    One passionate note of victory:
    Off, like a fool afraid, I sneaked,
    Smiling the smile the fool smiles best,
    At the mother bird in the secret hedge
    Patient upon her lonely nest.




    THE CHILD IN THE STORY GOES TO BED


    I prythee, Nurse, come smooth my hair,
      And prythee, Nurse, unloose my shoe,
    And trimly turn my silken sheet
      Upon my quilt of gentle blue.

    My pillow sweet of lavender
      Smooth with an amiable hand,
    And may the dark pass peacefully by
      As in the hour-glass droops the sand.

    Prepare my cornered manchet sweet,
      And in my little crystal cup
    Pour out the blithe and flowering mead
      That forthwith I may sup.

    Withdraw my curtains from the night,
      And let the crisped crescent shine
    Upon my eyelids while I sleep,
      And soothe me with her beams benign.

    From far-away there streams the singing
      Of the mellifluent nightingale,--
    Surely if goblins hear her lay,
      They shall not o'er my peace prevail.

    Now quench my silver lamp, prythee,
      And bid the harpers harp that tune
    Fairies which haunt the meadowlands
      Sing clearly to the stars of June.

    And bid them play, though I in dreams
      No longer heed their pining strains,
