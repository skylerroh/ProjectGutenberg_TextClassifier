Tell. Though they were doubled, and did weigh me down
      Prostrate to the earth, methinks I could rise up
      Erect, with nothing but the honest pride
      Of telling thee, usurper, to thy teeth,
      Thou art a monster! Think upon my chains?
      How came they on me?

Ges. Darest thou question me?

Tell. Darest thou not answer?

Ges. Do I hear?

Tell. Thou dost.

Ges. Beware my vengeance!

Tell. Can it more than kill?

Ges. Enough; it can do that.

Tell. No; not enough:
      It can not take away the grace of life;
      Its comeliness of look that virtue gives;
      Its port erect with consciousness of truth;
      Its rich attire of honorable deeds;
      Its fair report that's rife on good men's tongues;
      It can not lay its hands on these, no more
      Than it can pluck the brightness from the sun,
      Or with polluted finger tarnish it.

Ges. But it can make thee writhe.

Tell. It may.

Ges. And groan.

Tell. It may; and I may cry
      Go on, though it should make me groan again.

Ges. Whence comest thou?

Tell. From the mountains. Wouldst thou learn
      What news from thence?

Ges. Canst tell me any?

Tell. Ay: they watch no more the avalanche.

Ges. Why so?

Tell. Because they look for thee. The hurricane
      Comes unawares upon them; from its bed
      The torrent breaks, and finds them in its track.

Ges. What do they then?

Tell. Thank heaven it is not thou!
      Thou hast perverted nature in them.
      There's not a blessing heaven vouchsafes them, but
      The thought of thee--doth wither to a curse.

Ges. That's right! I'd have them like their hills,
     That never smile, though wanton summer tempt
     Them e'er so much.

Tell. But they do sometimes smile.

Ges. Ay! when is that?

Tell. When they do talk of vengeance.

Ges. Vengeance? Dare they talk of that?

Tell. Ay, and expect it too.

Ges. From whence?

Tell. From heaven!

Ges. From heaven?

Tell. And their true hands
      Are lifted up to it on every hill
      For justice on thee.

Ges. Where's thy abode?

Tell. I told thee, on the mountains.

Ges. Art married?

Tell. Yes.

Ges. And hast a family?

Tell. A son.

Ges. A son? Sarnem!

Sar. My lord, the boy--(Gesler signs to Sarnem to keep
        silence, and, whispering, sends him off.)

Tell. The boy? What boy?
      Is 't mine? and have they netted my young fledgeling?
      Now heaven support me, if they have! He'll own me,
      And share his father's ruin! But a look
      Would put him on his guard--yet how to give it!
      Now heart, thy nerve; forget thou 'rt flesh, be rock.
      They come, they come!
      That step--that step--that little step, so light
      Upon the ground, how heavy does it fall
      Upon my heart! I feel my child! (Enter Sarnem
         with Albert, whose eyes are riveted on Tell's bow,
         which Sarnem carries.)
      'T is he! We can but perish.

Alb. (Aside.) Yes; I was right. It is my father's bow!
     For there's my father! I'll not own him though!

Sar. See!

Alb. What?

Sar. Look there!

Alb. I do, what would you have me see?

Sar. Thy father.

Alb. Who? That--that my father?

Tell. My boy! my boy! my own brave boy!
      He's safe! (Aside.)

Sar. (Aside to Gesler.) They're like each other.

Ges. Yet I see no sign
     Of recognition to betray the link
     Unites a father and his child.

Sar. My lord,
     I am sure it is his father. Look at them.
     That boy did spring from him; or never cast
     Came from the mold it fitted! It may be
     A preconcerted thing 'gainst such a chance.
     That they survey each other coldly thus.

Ges. We shall try. Lead forth the caitiff.

Sar. To a dungeon?

Ges. No; into the court.

Sar. The court, my lord?

Ges. And send
     To tell the headsman to make ready. Quick!
     The slave shall die! You marked the boy?

Sar. I did. He started; 't is his father.

Ges. We shall see. Away with him!

Tell. Stop! Stop!

Ges. What would you?

Tell. Time,--
      A little time to call my thoughts together!

Ges. Thou shalt not have a minute.

Tell. Some one, then, to speak with.

Ges. Hence with him!

Tell. A moment! Stop!
      Let me speak to the boy.

Ges. Is he thy son?

Tell. And if
      He were, art thou so lost to nature, as
      To send me forth to die before his face?

Ges. Well! speak with him.
     Now, Sarnem, mark them well.

Tell. Thou dost not know me, boy; and well for thee
      Thou dost not. I'm the father of a son
      About thy age. Thou,
      I see, wast horn, like him, upon the hills:
      If thou shouldst 'scape thy present thraldom, he
      May chance to cross thee; if he should, I pray thee
      Relate to him what has been passing here,
      And say I laid my hand upon thy head,
      And said to thee, if he were here, as thou art,
      Thus would I bless him. Mayst thou live, my boy,
      To see thy country free, or die for her,
      As I do! (Albert weeps.)

Sar. Mark! he weeps.

Tell. Were he my son,
      He would not shed a tear! He would remember
      The cliff where he was bred, and learned to scan
      A thousand fathoms' depth of nether air;
      Where he was trained to hear the thunder talk,
      And meet the lightning, eye to eye; where last
      We spoke together, when I told him death
      Bestowed the brightest gem that graces life,
      Embraced for virtue's sake. He shed a tear!
      Now were he by, I'd talk to him, and his cheek
      Should never blanch, nor moisture dim his eye--
      I'd talk to him--

Sar.  He falters!

Tell. 'T is too much!
      And yet it must be done! I'd talk to him--

Ges. Of what?

Tell. The mother, tyrant, thou dost make
      A widow of! I'd talk to him of her.
      I'd bid him tell her, next to liberty,
      Her name was the last word my lips pronounced.
      And I would charge him never to forget
      To love and cherish her, as he would have
      His father's dying blessing rest upon him!

Sar. You see, as he doth prompt, the other acts.

Tell. So well he bears it, he doth vanquish me.
      My boy! my boy! Oh, for the hills, the hills,
      To see him bound along their tops again,
      With liberty.

Sar. Was there not an the father in that look?

Ges. Yet 't is 'gainst nature.

Sar. Not if he believes
     To own the son would be to make him share
     The father's death.

Ges. I did not think of that! 'T is well
     The boy is not thy son. I've destined him
     To die along with thee.

Tell. To die? For what?

Ges. For having braved my power, as thou hast. Lead
     them forth.
Tell. He's but a child.

Ges. Away with them!

Tell. Perhaps an only child.

Ges. No matter.

Tell. He may have a mother.

Ges. So the viper hath;
     And yet, who spares it for the mother's sake?

Tell. I talk to stone! I talk to it as though
      'T were flesh; and know 't is none. I'll talk to it
      No more. Come, my boy;
      I taught thee how to live, I'll show thee how to die.

Ges. He is thy child?

Tell. He is my child. (Weeps.)

Ges. I've wrung a tear from him! Thy name?

Tell. My name?
      It matters not to keep it from thee now;
      My name is Tell.

Ges. Tell? William Tell?

Tell. The same.

Ges. What! he, so famed 'bove all his countrymen,
     For guiding o'er the stormy lake the boat?
     And such a master of his bow, 't is said
     His arrows never miss! Indeed! I'll take
     Exquisite vengeance! Mark! I'll spare thy life;
     Thy boy's too; both of you are free; on one
     Condition.

Tell. Name it.

Ges. I would see you make
     A trial of your skill with that same bow
     You shoot so well with.

Tell. Name the trial you
      Would have me make.

Ges. You look upon your boy
     As though instinctively you guessed it.

Tell. Look upon my boy? What mean you? Look upon
      My boy as though I guessed it? Guessed the trial
      You'd have me make? Guessed it
      Instinctively? You do not mean--no--no,
      You would not have me make a trial of
      My skill upon my child! Impossible!
      I do not guess your meaning.

Ges. I would see
     Thee hit an apple at the distance of
     A hundred paces.

Tell. Is my boy to hold it?

Ges. No.

Tell. No? I'll send the arrow through the core!

Ges. It is to rest upon his head.

Tell. Great heaven, you hear him!

Ges. Thou dost hear the choice I give:
     Such trial of the skill thou art master of,
     Or death to both of you, not otherwise
     To be escaped.

Tell. O, monster!

Ges. Wilt thou do it?

Alb. He will! he will!

Tell. Ferocious monster! Make
      A father murder his own child!

Ges. Take off his chains if he consent.

Tell. With his own hand!

Ges. Does he consent?

Alb. He does. (Gesler signs to his officers, who proceed to take
     off Tell's chains; Tell unconscious what they do.)

Tell. With his own hand!
      Murder his child with his own hand? This hand?
      The hand I've led him, when an infant, by?
      'T is beyond horror! 'T is most horrible!
      Amazement! (His chains fall off.) What's that you've
           done to me?
      Villains! put on my chains again. My hands
      Are free from blood, and have no gust for it,
      That they should drink my child's! Here! here! I'll
      Not murder my boy for Gesler.

Alb. Father! Father!
     You will not hit me, father!

Tell. Hit thee? Send
      The arrow through thy brain? Or, missing that,
      Shoot out an eye? Or, if thine eye escape,
      Mangle the cheek I've seen thy mother's lips
      Cover with kisses? Hit thee? Hit a hair
      Of thee, and cleave thy mother's heart?

Ges. Dost thou consent?

Tell. Give me my bow and quiver.

Ges. For what?

Tell. To shoot my boy!

Alb. No, father, no!
     To save me! You'll be sure to hit the apple.
     Will you not save me, father?

Tell. Lead me forth;
      I'll make the trial!

Alb. Thank you!

Tell. Thank me? Do
      You know for what? I will not make the trial.
      To take him to his mother in my arms!
      And lay him down a corse before her!

Ges. Then he dies this moment, and you certainly
     Do murder him whose life you have a chance
     To save, and will not use it.

Tell. Well, I'll do it; I'll make the trial.

Alb. Father!

Tell. Speak not to me:
      Let me not hear thy voice: thou must be dumb,
      And so should all things be. Earth should be dumb;
      And heaven--unless its thunders muttered at
      The deed, and sent a bolt to stop! Give me
      My bow and quiver!

Ges. When all's ready.

Tell. Ready!--
      I must be calm with such a mark to hit!
      Don't touch me, child!--Don't speak to me!--Lead on!

NOTE.--William Tell is a legendary hero of Switzerland. The events of this
drama are represented as occurring in 1307 A.D., when Austria held
Switzerland under her control. Gesler, also a purely mythical personage,
is one of the Austrian bailiffs. The legend relates that Gesler had his
cap placed on a pole in the market place, and all the Swiss were required
to salute it in passing in recognition of his authority. Tell refusing to
do this was arrested, and condemned to death. This and the following
lesson narrate how the sentence was changed, and the result.



LXVIII. WILLIAM TELL. (Concluded.)

SCENE 2.--Enter slowly, people in evident distress--Officers, Sarnem,
Gesler, Tell, Albert, and soldiers--one bearing Tell's bow and
quiver--another with a basket of apples.
