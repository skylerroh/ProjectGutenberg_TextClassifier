After Sally had fed the pigs, she took out some corn, and went to
the poultry yard, and called, "Chuck--chuck--chuck!" and then the
cocks and hens, and ducks and geese, came running round her,
crowing and clucking, and quacking, and cackling, and the pigeons
flew down and helped to eat, and all of them pecked up the corn,
as fast as they could. In the afternoon they had boiled potatoes
and sopped bread and vegetables, and curd, too, if Sally had been
making whey.

When Sally had done all this, she went back into her room, and
opened the bed curtains; and there was lying a little rosy-cheeked
girl with light curly hair. And when Sally looked at her, she
opened two large blue eyes, and held out her arms, and Sally kissed
her, and said, "Are you ready to get up, little Annie?" And she
said, "Yes." This was Sally's little sister, that her kind
mistress let her have with her to love and take care of.

Then Sally took up little Annie, and got a large brown pan for
her bath, and stood her in it, and brought a jug of fresh cold
water to pour over her.

Little Annie stood very still, but when the water was coming, she
held up her hands and said, "Will it be cold?"

"O, no!" said Sally; "it's a beautiful warm morning." Then she
washed and dressed little Annie, and afterwards they had their
breakfast together in a nice comfortable kitchen. Sally had a
good appetite after having been so busy, and little Annie had a
large basin of boiled bread and milk, and she always gave some to
Trusty. This was the end of the little Milk-maid's morning
work.
