Yes, we will hide, and then you must try to find us.

Well, go and hide.

One, two, three, four, five, six--look out for me, hoys.

Here I come. Ha! I see your black cap, Frank. Come out of that barn.

I spy you, Roy. You are hid under the hay; and there is Fred in the
box.

Now, Frank, you shut your eyes.

No, Fred, there is my pony, and I am going to take a ride.

Well, I will get my pony, and ride too. Shall we have a race?

Yes, but my pony can run faster than yours.

If I use my whip, I can keep up with you, and I may pass you.

But there is my sister. I must go and see her. What is it, sister?

Please put this shawl over me, Fred. Wrap me up well, for it is pretty
cold.

So kitty did not get sick, did she, sister?

O no! kitty is well, but she does not like the bath tub, Fred.

No, he will not hurt us. Do you not see the man feed him from his hand?

You like to see him play, do you?
