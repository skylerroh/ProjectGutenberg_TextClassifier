    I held the trunk with both my hands
    And looked abroad on foreign lands.

THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE                                                 18

    I was the giant great and still
    That sits upon the pillow-hill,

MY SHADOW                                                               20

    He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;
    I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!

      Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,
      Little frosty Eskimo,
      Little Turk or Japanee,
    Oh! don't you wish that you were me?

LOOKING-GLASS RIVER                                                     42

    We can see our coloured faces
      Floating on the shaken pool

THE HAYLOFT                                                             48

    Oh, what a joy to clamber there,
      Oh, what a place for play,
    With the sweet, the dim, the dusty air,
      The happy hills of hay!

NORTH-WEST PASSAGE                                                      50

    And face with an undaunted tread
    The long black passage up to bed.

PICTURE-BOOKS IN WINTER                                                 64

    Water now is turned to stone
    Nurse and I can walk upon;
    Still we find the flowing brooks
    In the picture story-books.

    And the Lady Hollyhock.

BED IN SUMMER


    In winter I get up at night
    And dress by yellow candle-light.
    In summer, quite the other way,
    I have to go to bed by day.

    I have to go to bed and see
    The birds still hopping on the tree,
    Or hear the grown-up people's feet
    Still going past me in the street.

    And does it not seem hard to you,
    When all the sky is clear and blue,
    And I should like so much to play,
    To have to go to bed by day?

A THOUGHT


    It is very nice to think
    The world is full of meat and drink,
    With little children saying grace
    In every Christian kind of place.

AT THE SEA-SIDE


    When I was down beside the sea
    A wooden spade they gave to me
      To dig the sandy shore.

    My holes were empty like a cup.
    In every hole the sea came up,
      Till it could come no more.

YOUNG NIGHT-THOUGHT


    All night long and every night,
    When my mama puts out the light,
    I see the people marching by,
    As plain as day, before my eye.

    Armies and emperors and kings,
    All carrying different kinds of things,
    And marching in so grand a way,
    You never saw the like by day.

    So fine a show was never seen
    At the great circus on the green;
    For every kind of beast and man
    Is marching in that caravan.

    At first they move a little slow,
    But still the faster on they go,
    And still beside them close I keep
    Until we reach the town of Sleep.

WHOLE DUTY OF CHILDREN


    A child should always say what's true
    And speak when he is spoken to,
    And behave mannerly at table;
    At least as far as he is able.




RAIN


    The rain is raining all around,
      It falls on field and tree,
    It rains on the umbrellas here,
      And on the ships at sea.

PIRATE STORY


    Three of us afloat in the meadow by the swing,
      Three of us aboard in the basket on the lea.
    Winds are in the air, they are blowing in the spring,
      And waves are on the meadow like the waves there are at sea.

    Where shall we adventure, to-day that we're afloat,
      Wary of the weather and steering by a star?
    Shall it be to Africa, a-steering of the boat,
      To Providence, or Babylon, or off to Malabar?

    Hi! but here's a squadron a-rowing on the sea--
      Cattle on the meadow a-charging with a roar!
    Quick, and we'll escape them, they're as mad as they can be,
      The wicket is the harbour and the garden is the shore.




FOREIGN LANDS


    Up into the cherry tree
    Who should climb but little me?
    I held the trunk with both my hands
    And looked abroad on foreign lands.

    I saw the next door garden lie,
    Adorned with flowers, before my eye,
    And many pleasant places more
    That I had never seen before.

    I saw the dimpling river pass
    And be the sky's blue looking-glass;
    The dusty roads go up and down
    With people tramping in to town.

    If I could find a higher tree
    Farther and farther I should see,
    To where the grown-up river slips
    Into the sea among the ships,

    To where the roads on either hand
    Lead onward into fairy land,
    Where all the children dine at five,
    And all the playthings come alive.

WINDY NIGHTS


    Whenever the moon and stars are set,
      Whenever the wind is high,
    All night long in the dark and wet,
      A man goes riding by.
    Late in the night when the fires are out,
    Why does he gallop and gallop about?

    Whenever the trees are crying aloud,
      And ships are tossed at sea,
    By, on the highway, low and loud,
      By at the gallop goes he.
    By at the gallop he goes, and then
    By he comes back at the gallop again.

TRAVEL


    I should like to rise and go
    Where the golden apples grow;--
    Where below another sky
    Parrot islands anchored lie,
    And, watched by cockatoos and goats,
    Lonely Crusoes building boats;--
    Where in sunshine reaching out
    Eastern cities, miles about,
    Are with mosque and minaret
    Among sandy gardens set,
    And the rich goods from near and far
    Hang for sale in the bazaar;--
