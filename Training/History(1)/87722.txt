safety, while you seek Lord Warwick.  I will go with you, if you can
obtain egress for us both."

"Brave damsel!" said Marmaduke, with emotion; "but your own safety--
the king's anger--no--besides a third, your dress not concealed, would
create the warder's suspicion.  Describe the house."

"The third to the left, by the river's side, with an arched porch, and
the fleur-de-lis embossed on the walls."

"It is not so dark but we shall find it.  Fare you well, gentle
mistress."

While they yet spoke, they had both reached the side of Anne.  Sibyll
still persisted in the wish to accompany her friend; but Marmaduke's
representation of the peril to life itself that might befall her
father, if Edward learned she had abetted Anne's escape, finally
prevailed.  The knight and his charge gained the outer gate.

"Haste, haste, Master Warder!" he cried, beating at the door with his
dagger till it opened jealously,--"messages of importance to the Lord
Warwick.  We have the king's signet.  Open!"

The sleepy warder glanced at the ring; the gates were opened; they
were without the fortress, they hurried on.  "Cheer up, noble lady;
you are safe, you shall be avenged!" said Marmaduke, as he felt the
steps of his companion falter.  But the reaction had come.  The effort
Anne had hitherto made was for escape, for liberty; the strength
ceased, the object gained; her head drooped, she muttered a few
incoherent words, and then sense and life left her.  Marmaduke paused
in great perplexity and alarm.  But lo, a light in a house before him!
That house the third to the river,--the only one with the arched porch
described by Sibyll.  He lifted the light and holy burden in his
strong arms, he gained the door; to his astonishment it was open; a
light burned on the stairs; he heard, in the upper room, the sound of
whispered voices, and quick, soft footsteps hurrying to and fro.
Still bearing the insensible form of his companion, he ascended the
staircase, and entered at once upon a chamber, in which, by a dim
lamp, he saw some two or three persons assembled round a bed in the
recess.  A grave man advanced to him, as he paused at the threshold.

"Whom seek you?"

"The Lady Longueville."

"Hush?"

"Who needs me?" said a faint voice, from the curtained recess.

"My name is Nevile," answered Marmaduke, with straightforward brevity.
"Mistress Sibyll Warner told me of this house, where I come for an
hour's shelter to my companion, the Lady Anne, daughter of the Earl of
Warwick."

Marmaduke resigned his charge to an old woman, who was the nurse in
that sick-chamber, and who lifted the hood and chafed the pale, cold
hands of the young maiden; the knight then strode to the recess.  The
Lady of Longueville was on the bed of death--an illness of two days
had brought her to the brink of the grave; but there was in her eye
and countenance a restless and preternatural animation, and her voice
was clear and shrill, as she said,--

"Why does the daughter of Warwick, the Yorkist, seek refuge in the
house of the fallen and childless Lancastrian?"

"Swear by thy hopes in Christ that thou will tend and guard her while
I seek the earl, and I reply."

"Stranger, my name is Longueville, my birth noble,--those pledges of
hospitality and trust are stronger than hollow oaths.  Say on!"

"Because, then," whispered the knight, after waving the bystanders
from the spot, "because the earl's daughter flies dishonour in a
king's palace, and her insulter is the king!"

Before the dying woman could reply, Anne, recovered by the cares of
the experienced nurse, suddenly sprang to the recess, and kneeling by
the bedside, exclaimed wildly,--"Save me! bide me! save me!"

"Go and seek the earl, whose right hand destroyed my house and his
lawful sovereign's throne,--go!  I will live till he arrives!" said
the childless widow, and a wild gleam of triumph shot over her haggard
features.




CHAPTER VIII.

THE GROUP ROUND THE DEATH-BED OF THE LANCASTRIAN WIDOW.

The dawning sun gleamed through gray clouds upon a small troop of men,
armed in haste, who were grouped round a covered litter by the outer
door of the Lady Longueville's house; while in the death-chamber, the
Earl of Warwick, with a face as pale as the dying woman's, stood
beside the bed, Anne calmly leaning on his breast, her eyes closed,
and tears yet moist on her long fringes.

"Ay, ay, ay!" said the Lancastrian noblewoman, "ye men of wrath and
turbulence should reap what ye have sown!  This is the king for whom
ye dethroned the sainted Henry! this the man for whom ye poured forth
the blood of England's best!  Ha!  ha!  Look down from heaven, my
husband, my martyr-sons!  The daughter of your mightiest foe flies to
this lonely hearth,--flies to the death-bed of the powerless woman for
refuge from the foul usurper whom that foe placed upon the throne!"

"Spare me," muttered Warwick, in a low voice, and between his grinded
teeth.  The room had been cleared, and Dr. Godard (the grave man who
had first accosted Marmaduke, and who was the priest summoned to the
dying) alone--save the scarce conscious Anne herself--witnessed the
ghastly and awful conference.

"Hush, daughter," said the man of peace, lifting the solemn crucifix,
--"calm thyself to holier thoughts."

The lady impatiently turned from the priest, and grasping the strong
right arm of Warwick with her shrivelled and trembling fingers,
resumed in a voice that struggled to repress the gasps which broke its
breath,--

"But thou--oh, thou wilt bear this indignity! thou, the chief of
England's barons, wilt see no dishonour in the rank love of the vilest
of England's kings!  Oh, yes, ye Yorkists have the hearts of varlets,
not of men and fathers!"

"By the symbol from which thou turnest, woman!" exclaimed the earl,
giving vent to the fury which the presence of death had before
suppressed, "by Him to whom, morning and night, I have knelt in
grateful blessing for the virtuous life of this beloved child, I will
have such revenge on the recreant whom I kinged, as shall live in the
rolls of England till the trump of the Judgment Angel!"

"Father," said Anne, startled by her father's vehemence from her half-
swoon, half-sleep--"Father, think no more of the past,--take me to my
mother!  I want the clasp of my mother's arms!"

"Leave us,--leave the dying, Sir Earl and son," said Godard.  "I too
am Lancastrian; I too would lay down my life for the holy Henry; but I
shudder, in the hour of death, to hear yon pale lips, that should pray
for pardon, preach to thee of revenge."

"Revenge!" shrieked out the dame of Longueville, as, sinking fast and
fast, she caught the word--"revenge!  Thou hast sworn revenge on
Edward of York, Lord Warwick,--sworn it in the chamber of death, in
the ear of one who will carry that word to the hero-dead of a hundred
battlefields!  Ha! the sun has risen!  Priest--Godard--thine arms--
support--raise--bear me to the casement!  Quick--quick!  I would see
my king once more!  Quick--quick! and then--then--I will hear thee
pray!"

The priest, half chiding, yet half in pity, bore the dying woman to
the casement.  She motioned to him to open it; he obeyed.  The sun,
just above the welkin, shone over the lordly Thames, gilded the gloomy
fortress of the Tower, and glittered upon the window of Henry's
prison.

"There--there!  It is he,--it is my king!  Hither,--lord, rebel earl,
--hither.  Behold your sovereign.  Repent, revenge!"

With her livid and outstretched hand, the Lancastrian pointed to the
huge Wakefield tower.  The earl's dark eye beheld in the dim distance
a pale and reverend countenance, recognized even from afar.  The dying
woman fixed her glazing eyes upon the wronged and mighty baron, and
suddenly her arm fell to her side, the face became set as into stone,
the last breath of life gurgled within, and fled; and still those
glazing eyes were fixed on the earl's hueless face, and still in his
ear, and echoed by a thousand passions in his heart, thrilled the word
which had superseded prayer, and in which the sinner's soul had
flown,--REVENGE!

midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
