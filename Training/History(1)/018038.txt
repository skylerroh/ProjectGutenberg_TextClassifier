TO FORESTA


    Upon the road to Faerie,
    O there are many sights to see,--
    Small woodland folk may one discern
    Housekeeping under leaf and fern,
    And little tunnels in the grass
    Where caravans of goblins pass,
    And airy corsair-craft that float
    On wings transparent as a mote,--
    All sorts of curious things can be
    Upon the road to Faerie!

    Along the wharves of Faerie--
    There all the winds of Christendie
    Are musical with hawk-bell chimes,
    Carillons rung to minstrels' rimes,
    And silver trumpets bravely blown
    From argosies of lands unknown,
    And the great war-drum's wakening roll--
    The reveille of heart and soul--
    For news of all the ageless sea
    Comes to the quays of Faerie!

    Across the fields to Faerie
    There is no lack of company,--
    The world is real, the world is wide,
    But there be many things beside.
    Who once has known that crystal spring
    Shall not lose heart for anything.
    The blessing of a faery wife
    Is love to sweeten all your life.
    To find the truth whatever it be--
    That is the luck of Faerie!

    _Above the gates of Faerie
    There bends a wild witch-hazel tree.
    The fairies know its elfin powers.
    They wove a garland of the flowers,
    And on a misty autumn day
    They crowned their queen--and ran away!
    And by that gift they made you free
    Of all the roads of Faerie!_

DAYS OF THE DISCOVERERS

ASGARD THE BEAUTIFUL


A red fox ran into the empty church. In the middle of the floor he sat
up and looked around. Nothing stirred--not the painted figures on the
wooden walls, nor the boy who now stood in the doorway. This boy was
gray-eyed and flaxen-haired, and might have been eleven or twelve years
old. He was looking for the good old priest, Father Ansgar, and the wild
shy animal eyeing him from the foot of the altar made it only too clear
that the church, like the village, was deserted.

Father Ansgar was dead of the strange swift pestilence that was called
in 1348 the Black Death. So also were the sexton, the cooper, the
shoemaker, and almost all the people of the valley. A ship had come into
Bergen with the plague on board, and it spread through Norway like a
grass-fire. Only last week Thorolf Erlandsson[1] had had a father and
mother, a grandmother, two younger sisters and a brother. Now he was
alone. In the night the dairy woman and the plowmen at Ormgard farm had
run away. Other farms and houses were already closed and silent, or
plundered and burned. Ormgard being remote had at first escaped the
sickness.

Thorolf turned away from the church door and began to climb the
mountain. At the lane leading to his home he did not stop, but kept on
into the woods. It was not so lonely there.

Up and up he climbed, the thrilling scent of fir-balsam in his nostrils,
the small friendly noises of the forest all about him. Only a few months
ago he had come down this very road with his father, driving the cattle
and goats home from the summer pasture. All the other farmers were doing
the same, and the clear notes of the lure, the long curving horn, used
for calling the cattle and signaling across valleys, soared from slope
to slope. There was laughter and shouting and joking all the way down.
Now the only persons abroad seemed to be thieving ruffians whose greed
for plunder was more than their fear of the plague.

A thought came to the boy. How could he leave his father's cattle unfed
and uncared for? What if he were to drive the cows himself to the saeter
and tend them through the summer? He faced about, resolutely, and began
to descend the hill.

Within sight of the familiar roofs he heard some one coming from the
village, on horseback. It proved to be Nils the son of Magnus the son of
Nils who was called the Bear-Slayer, with a sack of grain and a pair of
saddlebags on a sedate brown pony. Nils was lame of one foot and no
taller than a boy of nine, although he was thirteen this month and his
head was nearly as large as a man's. He had been an orphan from
