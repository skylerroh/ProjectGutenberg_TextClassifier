If here my sister dwells. But soft! Even now
I see some bondmaid there, her death-shorn brow
Bending beneath its freight of well-water.
Lie close until she pass; then question her.
A slave might help us well, or speak some sign
Of import to this work of mine and thine.

[_The two men retire into ambush._ ELECTRA _enters, returning from the
well._

ELECTRA.

  Onward, O labouring tread,
    As on move the years;
  Onward amid thy tears,
    O happier dead!

Let me remember. I am she,                       [_Strophe_ 1.
Agamemnon's child, and the mother of me
Clytemnestra, the evil Queen,
Helen's sister. And folk, I ween,
That pass in the streets call yet my name
Electra.... God protect my shame!
  For toil, toil is a weary thing,
    And life is heavy about my head;
  And thou far off, O Father and King,
    In the lost lands of the dead.
A bloody twain made these things be;
One was thy bitterest enemy,
And one the wife that lay by thee.

Brother, brother, on some far shore          [_Antistrophe_ 1.
Hast thou a city, is there a door
That knows thy footfall, Wandering One?
Who left me, left me, when all our pain
Was bitter about us, a father slain,
And a girl that wept in her room alone.
  Thou couldst break me this bondage sore,
    Only thou, who art far away,
  Loose our father, and wake once more....
    Zeus, Zeus, dost hear me pray?...
The sleeping blood and the shame and the doom!
O feet that rest not, over the foam
Of distant seas, come home, come home!

What boots this cruse that I carry?              [_Strophe_ 2.
  O, set free my brow!
For the gathered tears that tarry
  Through the day and the dark till now,
Now in the dawn are free,
  Father, and flow beneath
The floor of the world, to be
  As a song in she house of Death:
From the rising up of the day
They guide my heart alway,
The silent tears unshed,
And my body mourns for the dead;
My cheeks bleed silently,
  And these bruised temples keep
Their pain, remembering thee
  And thy bloody sleep.

Be rent, O hair of mine head!

As a swan crying alone
  Where the river windeth cold,
For a loved, for a silent one,
  Whom the toils of the fowler hold,
I cry, Father, to thee,
O slain in misery!

The water, the wan water,                    [_Antistrophe_ 2.
  Lapped him, and his head
Drooped in the bed of slaughter
  Low, as one wearied;
Woe for the edged axe,
  And woe for the heart of hate,
Houndlike about thy tracks,
  O conqueror desolate,
From Troy over land and sea,
Till a wife stood waiting thee;
Not with crowns did she stand,
Nor flowers of peace in her hand;
With Aegisthus' dagger drawn
  For her hire she strove,
Through shame and through blood alone;
  And won her a traitor's love.

[_As she ceases there enter from right and left the_ CHORUS, _consisting
of women of Argos, young and old, in festal dress_.


  CHORUS.

  _Some Women._

Child of the mighty dead,                          [_Strophe_.
  Electra, lo, my way
To thee in the dawn hath sped,
  And the cot on the mountain grey,
  For the Watcher hath cried this day:
He of the ancient folk,
  The walker of waste and hill,
Who drinketh the milk of the flock;
  And he told of Hera's will;
For the morrow's morrow now
  They cry her festival,
And before her throne shall bow
  Our damsels all.

ELECTRA.

Not unto joy, nor sweet
  Music, nor shining of gold,
The wings of my spirit beat.
  Let the brides of Argos hold
  Their dance in the night, as of old;
I lead no dance; I mark
  No beat as the dancers sway;
With tears I dwell in the dark,
  And my thought is of tears alway,
  To the going down of the day.
Look on my wasted hair
And raiment.... This that I bear,
Is it meet for the King my sire,
  And her whom the King begot?
For Troy, that was burned with fire
    And forgetteth not?


  CHORUS.

  _Other Women._

Hera is great!--Ah, come,                      [_Antistrophe_.
  Be kind; and my hand shall bring
Fair raiment, work of the loom,
  And many a golden thing,
  For joyous robe-wearing.
Deemest thou this thy woe
  Shall rise unto God as prayer,
Or bend thine haters low?
  Doth God for thy pain have care?
Not tears for the dead nor sighs,
  But worship and joy divine
Shall win thee peace in thy skies,
  O daughter mine!

ELECTRA.

No care cometh to God
  For the voice of the helpless; none
For the crying of ancient blood.
  Alas for him that is gone,
  And for thee, O wandering one:
That now, methinks, in a land
  Of the stranger must toil for hire,
And stand where the poor men stand,
  A-cold by another's fire,
  O son of the mighty sire:
While I in a beggar's cot
On the wrecked hills, changing not,
Starve in my soul for food;
  But our mother lieth wed
In another's arms, and blood
    Is about her bed.

LEADER.

On all of Greece she wrought great jeopardy,
Thy mother's sister, Helen,--and on thee.

[ORESTES _and_ PYLADES _move out from their concealment_; ORESTES _comes
forward_: PYLADES _beckons to two_ ARMED SERVANTS _and stays with them in
the background_.

ELECTRA.

Woe's me! No more of wailing! Women, flee!
Strange armed men beside the dwelling there
Lie ambushed! They are rising from their lair.
Back by the road, all you. I will essay
The house; and may our good feet save us!

ORESTES (_between_ ELECTRA _and the hut_).

                              Stay,
Unhappy woman! Never fear my steel.

ELECTRA (_in utter panic_).

O bright Apollo! Mercy! See, I kneel;
Slay me not.

ORESTES.

     Others I have yet to slay
Less dear than thou.

ELECTRA.

      Go from me! Wouldst thou lay
Hand on a body that is not for thee?

ORESTES.

None is there I would touch more righteously.

ELECTRA.

Why lurk'st thou by my house? And why a sword?

ORESTES.

Stay. Listen! Thou wilt not gainsay my word.

ELECTRA.

There--I am still. Do what thou wilt with me.
Thou art too strong.

ORESTES.

      A word I bear to thee...
Word of thy brother.

ELECTRA.

      Oh, friend! More than friend!
Living or dead?

ORESTES.

       He lives; so let me send
My comfort foremost, ere the rest be heard.

ELECTRA.

God love thee for the sweetness of thy word!

ORESTES.

God love the twain of us, both thee and me.

ELECTRA.

He lives! Poor brother! In what land weareth he
His exile?

ORESTES.

           Not one region nor one lot
His wasted life hath trod.

ELECTRA.

                           He lacketh not
For bread?

ORESTES.

         Bread hath he; but a man is weak
In exile.

ELECTRA.

What charge laid he on thee? Speak.

ORESTES.

To learn if thou still live, and how the storm,
Living, hath struck thee.

ELECTRA.

      That thou seest; this form
Wasted...

ORESTES.

          Yea, riven with the fire of woe.
I sigh to look on thee.

ELECTRA.

                        My face; and, lo,
My temples of their ancient glory shorn.

ORESTES.

Methinks thy brother haunts thee, being forlorn;
Aye, and perchance thy father, whom they slew...

ELECTRA.

What should be nearer to me than those two?

ORESTES.

And what to him, thy brother, half so dear
As thou?

ELECTRA.
         His is a distant love, not near
At need.

ORESTES.

         But why this dwelling place, this life
Of loneliness?

ELECTRA (_with sudden bitterness_).

               Stranger, I am a wife....
O better dead!

ORESTES.

               That seals thy brother's doom!
What Prince of Argos...?

ELECTRA.

                         Not the man to whom
My father thought to give me.

ORESTES.

                              Speak; that I
May tell thy brother all.

ELECTRA.

                          'Tis there, hard by,
His dwelling, where I live, far from men's eyes.

ORESTES.

Some ditcher's cot, or cowherd's, by its guise!

ELECTRA (_struck with shame for her ingratitude_).

A poor man; but true-hearted, and to me
God-fearing.

ORESTES.

             How? What fear of God hath he?

ELECTRA.

He hath never held my body to his own.

ORESTES.

Hath he some vow to keep? Or is it done
To scorn thee?

ELECTRA.

                             Nay; he only scorns to sin
Against my father's greatness.

ORESTES.

                                But to win
A princess! Doth his heart not leap for pride?

ELECTRA.

He honoureth not the hand that gave the bride.

ORESTES.

I see. He trembles for Orestes' wrath?

ELECTRA.

Aye, that would move him. But beside, he hath
A gentle heart.

ORESTES.

                Strange! A good man.... I swear
He well shall be requited.

ELECTRA.

                            Whensoe'er
Our wanderer comes again!

ORESTES.

                          Thy mother stays
Unmoved 'mid all thy wrong?

ELECTRA.

                            A lover weighs
More than a child in any woman's heart.
