that is in knowledge, and I know that of all the powerful impulses which
stir our hearts, one only comes solely from Seth, one only belongs wholly
to the Evil one and that is hatred between man and man.  Covetousness may
lead to industry, sensual appetites may beget noble fruit, but hatred is
a devastator, and in the soul that it occupies all that is noble grows
not upwards and towards the light, but downwards to the earth and to
darkness.  Everything may be forgiven by the Gods, save only hatred
between man and man.  But there is another sort of hatred that is
pleasing to the Gods, and which you must cherish if you would not miss
their presence in your souls; that is, hatred for all that hinders the
growth of light and goodness and purity--the hatred of Horus for Seth.
The Gods would punish me if I hated Paaker whose father was dear to me;
but the spirits of darkness would possess the old heart in my breast if
it were devoid of horror for the covetous and sordid devotee, who would
fain buy earthly joys of the Gods with gifts of beasts and wine, as men
exchange an ass for a robe, in whose soul seethe dark promptings.
Paaker's gifts can no more be pleasing to the Celestials than a cask of
attar of roses would please thee, haruspex, in which scorpions,
centipedes, and venomous snakes were swimming.  I have long led this
man's prayers, and never have I heard him crave for noble gifts, but a
thousand times for the injury of the men he hates."

"In the holiest prayers that come down to us from the past," said the
haruspex, "the Gods are entreated to throw our enemies under our feet;
and, besides, I have often heard Paaker pray fervently for the bliss of
his parents."

"You are a priest and one of the initiated," cried Gagabu, "and you know
not--or will not seem to know--that by the enemies for whose overthrow we
pray, are meant only the demons of darkness and the outlandish peoples by
whom Egypt is endangered!  Paaker prayed for his parents?  Ay, and so
will he for his children, for they will be his future as his fore fathers
are his past.  If he had a wife, his offerings would be for her too, for
she would be the half of his own present."

"In spite of all this," said the haruspex Septah, "you are too hard in
your judgment of Paaker, for although lie was born under a lucky sign,
the Hathors denied him all that makes youth happy.  The enemy for whose
destruction he prays is Mena, the king's charioteer, and, indeed, he must
have been of superhuman magnanimity or of unmanly feebleness, if he could
have wished well to the man who robbed him of the beautiful wife who was
destined for him."

"How could that happen?"  asked the priest from Chennu.  "A betrothal is
sacred."

     [In the demotic papyrus preserved at Bulaq (novel by Setnau) first
     treated by H. Brugsch, the following words occur: "Is it not the
     law, which unites one to another?"  Betrothed brides are mentioned,
     for instance on the sarcophagus of Unnefer at Bulaq.]

"Paaker," replied Septah, "was attached with all the strength of his
ungoverned but passionate and faithful heart to his cousin Nefert, the
sweetest maid in Thebes, the daughter of Katuti, his mother's sister; and
she was promised to him to wife.  Then his father, whom he accompanied on
his marches, was mortally wounded in Syria.  The king stood by his death-
bed, and granting his last request, invested his son with his rank and
office: Paaker brought the mummy of his father home to Thebes, gave him
princely interment, and then before the time of mourning was over,
hastened back to Syria, where, while the king returned to Egypt, it was
his duty to reconnoitre the new possessions.  At last he could quit the
scene of war with the hope of marrying Nefert.  He rode his horse to
death the sooner to reach the goal of his desires; but when he reached
Tanis, the city of Rameses, the news met him that his affianced cousin
had been given to another, the handsomest and bravest man in Thebes--the
noble Mena.  The more precious a thing is that we hope to possess, the
more we are justified in complaining of him who contests our claim, and
can win it from us.  Paaker's blood must have been as cold as a frog's if
he could have forgiven Mena instead of hating him, and the cattle he has
offered to the Gods to bring down their wrath on the head of the traitor
may be counted by hundreds."

"And if you accept them, knowing why they are offered, you do unwisely
and wrongly," exclaimed Gagabu.  "If I were a layman, I would take good
care not to worship a Divinity who condescends to serve the foulest human
fiends for a reward.  But the omniscient Spirit, that rules the world in
accordance with eternal laws, knows nothing of these sacrifices, which
only tickle the nostrils of the evil one.  The treasurer rejoices when a
beautiful spotless heifer is driven in among our herds.  But Seth rubs
his red hands

     [Red was the color of Seth and Typhon.  The evil one is named the
     Red, as for instance in the papyrus of fibers.  Red-haired men were
     typhonic.]

with delight that he accepts it.  My friends, I have heard the vows which
Paaker has poured out over our pure altars, like hogwash that men set
before swine.  Pestilence and boils has he called down on Mena, and
barrenness and heartache on the poor sweet woman; and I really cannot
blame her for preferring a battle-horse to a hippopotamus--a Mena to a
Paaker."

"Yet the Immortals must have thought his remonstrances less
unjustifiable, and have stricter views as to the inviolable nature of a
betrothal than you," said the treasurer, "for Nefert, during four years
of married life, has passed only a few weeks with her wandering husband,
and remains childless.  It is hard to me to understand how you, Gagabu,
who so often absolve where we condemn, can so relentlessly judge so great
a benefactor to our temple."

"And I fail to comprehend," exclaimed the old man, "how you--you who so
willingly condemn, can so weakly excuse this--this--call him what you
will."

"He is indispensable to us at this time," said the haruspex.

"Granted," said Gagabu, lowering his tone.  "And I think still to make
use of him, as the high-priest has done in past years with the best
effect when dangers have threatened us; and a dirty road serves when it
makes for the goal.  The Gods themselves often permit safety to come from
what is evil, but shall we therefore call evil good--or say the hideous
is beautiful?  Make use of the king's pioneer as you will, but do not,
because you are indebted to him for gifts, neglect to judge him according
to his imaginings and deeds if you would deserve your title of the
Initiated and the Enlightened.  Let him bring his cattle into our temple
and pour his gold into our treasury, but do not defile your souls with
the thought that the offerings of such a heart and such a hand are
pleasing to the Divinity.  Above all," and the voice of the old man had a
heart-felt impressiveness, "Above all, do not flatter the erring man--and
this is what you do, with the idea that he is walking in the right way;
for your, for our first duty, O my friends, is always this--to guide the
souls of those who trust in us to goodness and truth."

"Oh, my master!"  cried Pentaur, "how tender is thy severity."

"I have shown the hideous sores of this man's soul," said the old man, as
he rose to quit the hall.  "Your praise will aggravate them, your blame
will tend to heal them.  Nay, if you are not content to do your duty, old
Gagabu will come some day with his knife, and will throw the sick man
down and cut out the canker."

During this speech the haruspex had frequently shrugged his shoulders.
Now he said, turning to the priests from Chennu--

"Gagabu is a foolish, hot-headed old man, and you have heard from his
lips just such a sermon as the young scribes keep by them when they enter
on the duties of the care of souls.  His sentiments are excellent, but he
easily overlooks small things for the sake of great ones.  Ameni would
tell you that ten souls, no, nor a hundred, do not matter when the safety
of the whole is in question."

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
