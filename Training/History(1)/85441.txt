With a firm step he went towards them and said:

"I have expelled this man from among us, for he is a disgrace to us.
To-morrow he quits the temple."

"I will go at once," replied the gate-keeper defiantly, "and in behalf of
the holy fathers (here he cast a significant glance at the priests), ask
the high-priest Ameni if the unclean are henceforth to be permitted to
enter this sanctuary."

He was already approaching the gate, but Pentaur stepped before him,
saying resolutely:

"You will remain here and keep the geese to-morrow, day after to-morrow,
and until I choose to pardon you."  The gate-keeper looked enquiringly at
the priests.  Not one moved.

"Go back into your house," said Pentaur, going closer to him.

The porter obeyed.

Pentaur locked the door of the little room, gave the key to one of the
temple-servants, and said: "Perform his duty, watch the man, and if he
escapes you will go after the geese to-morrow too.  See, my friends, how
many worshippers kneel there before our altars--go and fulfil your
office.  I will wait in the confessional to receive complaints, and to
administer comfort."

The priests separated and went to the votaries.  Pentaur once more
mounted the steps, and sat down in the narrow confessional which was
closed by a curtain; on its wall the picture of Hatasu was to be seen,
drawing the milk of eternal life from the udders of the cow Hathor.

He had hardly taken his place when a temple-servant announced the arrival
of a veiled lady.  The bearers of her litter were thickly veiled, and she
had requested to be conducted to the confession chamber.  The servant
handed Pentaur a token by which the high-priest of the great temple of
Anion, on the other bank of the Nile, granted her the privilege of
entering the inner rooms of the temple with the Rechiu, and to
communicate with all priests, even with the highest of the initiated.

The poet withdrew behind a curtain, and awaited the stranger with a
disquiet that seemed to him all the more singular that he had frequently
found himself in a similar position.  Even the noblest dignitaries had
often been transferred to him by Ameni when they had come to the temple
to have their visions interpreted.

A tall female figure entered the still, sultry stone room, sank on her
knees, and put up a long and absorbed prayer before the figure of Hathor.
Pentaur also, seen by no one, lifted his hands, and fervently addressed
himself to the omnipresent spirit with a prayer for strength and purity.

Just as his arms fell the lady raised her head.  It was as though the
prayers of the two souls had united to mount upwards together.

The veiled lady rose and dropped her veil.

It was Bent-Anat.

In the agitation of her soul she had sought the goddess Hathor, who
guides the beating heart of woman and spins the threads which bind man
and wife.

"High mistress of heaven! many-named and beautiful!" she began to pray
aloud, "golden Hathor! who knowest grief and ecstasy--the present and the
future--draw near to thy child, and guide the spirit of thy servant, that
he may advise me well.  I am the daughter of a father who is great and
noble and truthful as one of the Gods.  He advises me--he will never
compel me--to yield to a man whom I can never love.  Nay, another has met
me, humble in birth but noble in spirit and in gifts--"

Thus far, Pentaur, incapable of speech, had overheard the princess.

Ought he to remain concealed and hear all her secret, or should he step
forth and show himself to her?  His pride called loudly to him: "Now she
will speak your name; you are the chosen one of the fairest and noblest."
But another voice to which he had accustomed himself to listen in severe
self-discipline made itself heard, and said--"Let her say nothing in
ignorance, that she need be ashamed of if she knew."

He blushed for her;--he opened the curtain and went forward into the
presence of Bent-Anat.

The Princess drew back startled.

"Art thou Pentaur," she asked, "or one of the Immortals?"

"I am Pentaur," he answered firmly, "a man with all the weakness of his
race, but with a desire for what is good.  Linger here and pour out thy
soul to our Goddess; my whole life shall be a prayer for thee."

The poet looked full at her; then he turned quickly, as if to avoid a
danger, towards the door of the confessional.

Bent-Anat called his name, and he stayed his steps:

"The daughter of Rameses," she said, "need offer no justification of her
appearance here, but the maiden Bent-Anat," and she colored as she spoke,
"expected to find, not thee, but the old priest Rui, and she desired his
advice.  Now leave me to pray."

Bent-Anat sank on her knees, and Pentaur went out into the open air.

When the princess too had left the confessional, loud voices were heard
on the south side of the terrace on which they stood.

She hastened towards the parapet.

"Hail to Pentaur!"  was shouted up from below.  The poet rushed forward,
and placed himself near the princess.  Both looked down into the valley,
and could be seen by all.

"Hail, hail! Pentaur," was called doubly loud, "Hail to our teacher!
come back to the House of Seti.  Down with the persecutors of Pentaur--
down with our oppressors !"

At the head of the youths, who, so soon as they had found out whither the
poet had been exiled, had escaped to tell him that they were faithful to
him, stood the prince Rameri, who nodded triumphantly to his sister, and
Anana stepped forward to inform the honored teacher in a solemn and well-
studied speech, that, in the event of Ameni refusing to recall him, they
had decided requesting their fathers to place them at another school.

The young sage spoke well, and Bent-Anat followed his words, not without
approbation; but Pentaur's face grew darker, and before his favorite
disciple had ended his speech he interrupted him sternly.

His voice was at first reproachful, and then complaining, and loud as he
spoke, only sorrow rang in his tones, and not anger.

"In truth," he concluded, "every word that I have spoken to you I could
but find it in me to regret, if it has contributed to encourage you to
this mad act.  You were born in palaces; learn to obey, that later you
may know how to command.  Back to your school!  You hesitate?  Then I
will come out against you with the watchman, and drive you back, for you
do me and yourselves small honor by such a proof of affection.  Go back
to the school you belong to."

The school-boys dared make no answer, but surprised and disenchanted
turned to go home.

Bent-Anat cast down her eyes as she met those of her brother, who
shrugged his shoulders, and then she looked half shyly, half
respectfully, at the poet; but soon again her eyes turned to the plain
below, for thick dust-clouds whirled across it, the sound of hoofs and
the rattle of wheels became audible, and at the same moment the chariot
of Septah, the chief haruspex, and a vehicle with the heavily-armed guard
of the House of Seti, stopped near the terrace.

The angry old man sprang quickly to the ground, called the host of
escaped pupils to him in a stern voice, ordered the guard to drive them
back to the school, and hurried up to the temple gates like a vigorous
youth.  The priests received him with the deepest reverence, and at once
laid their complaints before him.

He heard them willingly, but did not let them discuss the matter; then,
though with some difficulty, he quickly mounted the steps, down which
Bent-Anat came towards him.

The princess felt that she would divert all the blame and
misunderstanding to herself, if Septah recognized her; her hand
involuntarily reached for her veil, but she drew it back quickly, looked
with quiet dignity into the old man's eyes, which flashed with anger, and
proudly passed by him.  The haruspex bowed, but without giving her his
blessing, and when he met Pentaur on the second terrace, ordered that the
temple should be cleared of worshippers.

This was done in a few minutes, and the priests were witnesses of the
most painful, scene which had occurred for years in their quiet
sanctuary.

The head of the haruspices of the House of Seti was the most determined
adversary of the poet who had so early been initiated into the mysteries,
and whose keen intellect often shook those very ramparts which the
zealous old man had, from conviction, labored to strengthen from his
youth up.  The vexatious occurrences, of which he had been a witness at
the House of Seti, and here also but a few minutes since, he regarded as
the consequence of the unbridled license of an ill-regulated imagination,
and in stern language he called Pentaur to account for the "revolt" of
the school-boys.

"And besides our boys," he exclaimed, "you have led the daughter of
Rameses astray.  She was not yet purged of her uncleanness, and yet you
tempt her to an assignation, not even in the stranger's quarters--but in
the holy house of this pure Divinity."  Undeserved praise is dangerous to
the weak; unjust blame may turn even the strong from the right way.
Pentaur indignantly repelled the accusations of the old man, called them
unworthy of his age, his position, and his name, and for fear that his
anger might carry him too far, turned his back upon him; but the haruspex
ordered him to remain, and in his presence questioned the priests, who
unanimously accused the poet of having admitted to the temple another
unpurified woman besides Bent-Anat, and of having expelled the gate-
keeper and thrown him into prison for opposing the crime.

The haruspex ordered that the "ill-used  man" should be set at liberty.

Pentaur resisted this command, asserted his right to govern in this
temple, and with a trembling voice requested Septah to quit the place.

The haruspex showed him Ameni's ring, by which, during his residence in
Thebes, he made him his plenipotentiary, degraded Pentaur from his
dignity, but ordered him not to quit the sanctuary till further notice,
and then finally departed from the temple of Hatasu.

Pentaur had yielded in silence to the signet of his chief, and returned
to the confessional in which he had met Bent-Anat.  He felt his soul
shaken to its very foundations, his thoughts were confused, his feelings
struggling with each other; he shivered, and when he heard the laughter
of the priests and the gatekeeper, who were triumphing in their easy
victory, he started and shuddered like a man who in passing a mirror
should see a brand of disgrace on his brow.

But by degrees he recovered himself, his spirit grew clearer, and when
he left the little room to look towards the east--where, on the farther
shore, rose the palace where Bent-Anat must be--a deep contempt for his
enemies filled his soul, and a proud feeling of renewed manly energy.  He
did not conceal from himself that he had enemies; that a time of struggle
was beginning for him; but he looked forward to it like a young hero to
the morning of his first battle.
