
The former edition has been rewritten, as it had become evident that
a work on the same plan, but more comprehensive, and better suited
to prevailing courses and methods of class-work, would be still more
heartily welcomed.

Important events are treated with greater fulness, and the relation
of English History to that of Europe and the world is carefully shown.
References for further study are added.

The text is in short paragraphs, each with a topical heading in bold
type for the student's use. The headings may be made to serve the
purpose of questions. By simply passing them over, the reader has
a clear, continuous narrative.

The treatment of each reign is closed with a brief summary of its
principal points. Likewise, at the end of each period there is a
section showing the condition of the country, and its progress in
Government, Religion, Military Affairs, Learning and Art, General
Industry, Manners and Customs. These summaries will be found of the
greatest value for reference, review, and fuller study; but when the
book is used for a brief course, or for general reading, they may
be omitted. An appendix gives a Constitutional Summary.

No pains have been spared to make the execution of the work equal
to its plan. Vivid touches here and there betray the author's mastery
of details. Thorough investigation has been made of all points where
there was reason to doubt traditional statements. The proof-sheets
have been carefully read by two experienced high-school teachers,
and also by two college professors of history.

The text is illustrated with fourteen maps, and supplemented
with full genealogical and chronological tables.

A FEW REPRESENTATIVE OPINIONS.

Hon. E. J. Phelps, _recently United States Minister to Great
Britain_: In my opinion, the author has done extremely well a
much-needed work, in presenting in so terse, clear, and available
form the principal points in that greatest of all histories, the
common property and most useful study of the English-speaking race.

Professor Goldwin Smith: The book, besides being very attractive in
appearance, seems to be very suitable for the purpose in view, viz.,
to present school pupils with a clear and intelligent idea of the
main facts of English history in connection with the social and
industrial development of the nation.

Elisha B. Andrews, _President of Brown University_: I do not remember
to have seen any book before which sets forth the leading facts of
English History so succinctly, and at the same time so interestingly
and clearly.

A. L. Perry, _Prof. of Political Economy, Williams College_: I have
never seen anything at all equal to it for the niche it was intended
to fill.

J. B. Clark, _Prof. of History, Smith College_: I especially like
its introduction of matter relating to the life of the people, in
a way that seems to make the narrative less dry, rather than more
so, as so often happens.

Jas. F. Colby, _Prof. of Law and Political Science, Dartmouth
College_: Its title is a true description of its contents. Its author
shows sense of proportion, and wisely gives prominence to economic
facts and the development of constitutional principles.

P. V. N. Myers, _Prof. in Univ. of Cincinnati_: The book was an
admirable one as first issued, but the careful revision and the
addition of maps and tables have added greatly to its value. In my
judgment it is by far the best English History for schoolroom use
now before the public.

W. F. Allen, _late Prof. of History, University of Wis., Madison_:
As I have said in relation to the earlier edition, the author has
succeeded in an unusual degree in telling the story of English
History in an interesting and suggestive manner, keeping clear of
the prevailing fault of loading his pages with unessential names and
dates.

F. B. Palmer, _Principal of State Normal School, Fredonia, N.Y._:
I have not examined anything that seems to me equal to it for a class
in English History.

John Fiske, _Prof. of History, Washington University_: It seems to
me excellent.

Frances A. Cooke, _Teacher of History, Penn Charter School,
Philadelphia, Pa._: My verdict on Montgomery's History is
unqualified approval. I have not seen a text-book upon English
History so well adapted to school use.

C. B. Gilbert, _Supt. Pub. Schools, St. Paul, Minn._: In many
respects I consider it the best text-book on English History for high
schools that I have seen. Its arrangement is excellent, its style
clear and very attractive.

Frank E. Plummer, _Prin. of High School, Des Moines, Ia._: I examined
it very carefully, and pronounce it the best English History for
high-school use of any with which I am familiar.


_The Leading Facts of French History_.
By D. H. MONTGOMERY, Author of _The Leading Facts of English History_,
_English History Reader_, etc. 12mo. Cloth. vi + 321 pages, with
fourteen black and colored maps, and full tables. Mailing Price,
$1.25; for Introduction, $1.12.

The object of this volume is to present, within the moderate compass
of two hundred and ninety-two pages, the most important events of
the history of France, selected, arranged, and treated according to
the soundest principles of historical study, and set forth in a clear
and attractive narrative.

The respective influences of the Celtic race, and of the Roman and
the German conquest and occupation of Gaul are clearly shown.

Charlemagne's work and the subsequent growth of feudal institutions
are next considered.

The breaking up of the feudal system, with the gradual consolidation
of the provinces into one kingdom, and the development of the
sentiment of nationality, are traced and illustrated.

The growth of the absolutism of the crown, the interesting and
important relations of France to America, and the causes of the
French Revolution, are fully presented.

The career of Napoleon and its effects on France and Europe are
carefully examined.

Finally, a sketch is given of the stages of the historical progress
of France in connection with the state of the Republic to-day.

G. W. Knight, _Prof. of History, Ohio State University_: I do not
know another book which, in anything like the same space, conveys
for youthful students so good a notion of French events.

A. H. Fetterolf, _Pres. of Girard College_: I like it very much. It
is an excellent book and I trust soon to have it used in Girard
College.

Edward G. Bourne, _Prof. of History, Adelbert College_: I have no
hesitation in pronouncing it the best French history of its scope
that I have seen. It is clear and accurate, and shows unusual skill
in the selection of matter as well as judgment in emphasizing the
political significance of events.

The Nation, _New York_: It is a marked advance on any available work
of its scope. The author has shown competent judgment in the choice
of his facts and his style is clear and interesting. The proportions
are well observed, and the political significance of events is given
due prominence in his treatment. So far as we have noticed, unusual
accuracy has been achieved.


_Reference History of the United States_.
By HANNAH A. DAVIDSON, M.A., Teacher of History, Belmont School,
California. 12mo. Cloth. xii + 190 pages. By mail, 90 cents; for
introduction, 80 cents.

This book, which is designed expressly for schools of advanced
grade, high schools, academies, and seminaries, is an attempt to
connect history teaching more closely in method and matter with the
teaching and study of history in the college and the university. In
the best institutions the study of history is no longer the study
of a text-book. The library is the workshop, the best books that have
been written are the tools; the teacher is the guide, and the pupil's
mind must do the work.

The objects of the method of instruction outlined in this book are
two: First, to help the pupil acquire discipline, and to train him
in those methods of work which he ought to use throughout his college
course; second, to give the pupil a sufficiently broad and reliable
knowledge of facts to serve as a basis for his future study of
constitutional history, politics, etc., and to put these facts into
such due relation to each other and to commonly accepted opinions
that they will not have to be re-adjusted when broader knowledge has
been acquired.

The subject is divided into a series of topics; under each topic
questions are asked; and after each question references to the best
accessible authorities are given in abbreviated form, though in such
a way as to be immediately understood. A space is left after each
set of references for additional ones to be inserted by the student.

The work was used for three years in manuscript by boys in the fourth
year below the Freshman class of our best universities; that is to
say, at the same time with Latin and Geometry or Algebra.

Oliver Emerson Bennett, _Chauncy Hall School, Boston_: I consider
it a valuable and useful addition to my library, and a great
assistance in my daily work.

New York Independent: This is a first-rate guide for the student of
United States History. It puts him on the right lines, shows him what
to read, and gives him intelligent guidance and direction all through.
It is hardly possible that a student following this guide should fail
to come out with a broad and critical command of the subject.
