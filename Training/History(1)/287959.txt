had reserved near him for the sudden exigencies of the field; and by
this providence of his, the more furiously they had advanced, the more
keenly were they repulsed and utterly routed. Thus against the Britons
themselves their own devices were turned; and by the order of the
General, the squadrons of cavalry which charged in front, wheeled about
and assailed the enemy behind. Then in truth, all over the open fields
was to be seen a spectacle prodigious and tragical, incessant pursuits,
wounds and captivity, and the present captives always slaughtered, as
often as others occurred to be taken. Now the enemy behaved just as they
happened to be prompted by their several humours. Sometimes they fled in
large troops with all their arms, before a smaller number that pursued
them: others, quite unarmed, rushed into peril, and desperately
presented themselves to instant death. On all sides lay scattered arms
and carcasses, and mangled limbs, and the ground was dyed with blood.
Nay, now and then even by the vanquished was exerted notable wrath and
bravery. When once they drew near the woods, they rejoined and rallied,
and thus circumvented the foremost pursuers, such as, without knowing
the country, had rashly ventured too far. Whence we must have suffered
some notable disaster, from such confidence void of caution, had
not Agricola who was assiduously visiting every quarter, ordered the
stoutest cohorts lightly equipped to range themselves in the form of
a toil [Footnote: A net or web, to encompass them; such as Herodotus
describes, for clearing out a vanquished enemy.] to invest them, also
some of the cavalry to dismount, and enter the strait passes, and the
rest of the horse, at the same time, to beat the more open and passable
parts of the woods. Now, as soon as they perceived our forces to
continue the pursuit with ranks regular and close, they betook
themselves to open flight, in no united bands as before, no one man
regarding or awaiting another; but quite scattered, and each shunning
any companion, they all made to places far remote and desert. What ended
the pursuit was night and a satiety of slaughter. Of the enemy were
slain ten thousand. There fell of our men three hundred and forty,
amongst these Aulus Atticus, commander of a cohort; one by his own
youthful heart, as also by a fiery horse, hurried into the midst of the
enemies.

It was indeed a night of great joy to the conquerors, both from victory
and spoil. The Britons, who wandered in despair, men and women uttering
in concert their dismal wailings, dragged along their wounded, called to
such as were unhurt, deserted their houses, nay, in rage even set them
on fire; made choice of lurking holes, then instantly forsook them; then
met to consult, and from their counsels gathered some hope: sometimes,
upon beholding their dearest pledges of nature, their spirits became
utterly sunk and dejected; sometimes, by the same sight, they were
roused into resolution and fury. Nay, 'tis very certain, that some
murdered their children and wives, as an act of compassion and
tenderness. The next day produced a more ample display of the victory;
on all sides a profound silence, solitary hills, thick smoke rising from
the houses on fire, and not a living soul to be found by the scouts.
When from these, who had been despatched out every way, it was learnt,
that whither the enemy had fled no certain traces could be discovered,
and that they had nowhere rallied in bodies; when the summer was
likewise passed and thence an impossibility of extending the operations
of war, he conducted his army into the borders of the Horestians. After
he had there received hostages, he ordered the Admiral of the Fleet to
sail round Britain. For this expedition he was furnished with proper
forces, and before him was already gone forth the terror of the Roman
power: he himself the while led on his foot and horse with a slow pace,
that thus the minds of these new nations might be awed and dismayed
even by prolonging his march through them: he then lodged his army in
garrisons for the winter. The fleet too having found a favourable sea,
entered with great fame, into the harbour of Rhutupium: [Footnote:
Supposed to be Sandwich Haven.] for, from thence it had sailed, and
coasting along the nethermost shore of Britain, thither returned.

With this course and situation of things Agricola by letters acquainted
the Emperor; tidings which, however modestly recounted, without all
ostentation, or any pomp of words, Domitian received as with joy in his
countenance, so with anguish in his soul: such was his custom. His heart
indeed smote him for his late mock triumph over the Germans, which he
knew to be held in public derision; as to adorn it he had purchased a
number of slaves, who were so decked in their habits and hair, as to
resemble captives in war. But here a victory mighty and certain, gained
by the slaughter of so many thousands of the enemy, was universally
sounded by the voice of fame, and received with vast applause. Terrible
above all things it was to him, that the name of a private man should be
exalted above that of the Prince. In vain had he driven from the public
tribunals all pursuits of popular evidence and fame, in vain smothered
the lustre of every civil accomplishment, if any other than himself
possessed the glory of excelling in war: nay, however he might dissemble
every other distaste, yet to the person of the Emperor properly
appertained the virtue and praise of being a great General. Tortured
with these anxious thoughts, and indulging his humour of being shut up
in secret, a certain indication that he was fostering some sanguinary
purpose, he at last judged it the best course, upon this occasion, to
hide and reserve his rancour till the first flights of fame were
passed, and the affection of the army cooled. For, Agricola held yet the
administration of Britain.

To him therefore he caused to be decreed in Senate the triumphal
ornaments, a statue crowned with laurel, with whatever else is bestowed
instead of a real triumph, and heightened this his compliment with many
expressions full of esteem and honour. He directed moreover a general
expectation to be raised, that to Agricola was destined the Province of
Syria, a Government then vacant by the death of Atilius Rufus, a man
of Consular quality, since the same was reserved only for men of
illustrious rank. Many there were who believed, that an Imperial
freedman, one much trusted with the secret designs of his master, was by
him despatched to carry the instrument appointing Agricola Governor of
Syria, with orders to deliver it to him, were he still in Britain;
that the freedman met Agricola crossing the Channel, and without once
speaking to him, returned directly to Domitian. It is uncertain whether
this account be true, or only a fiction framed in conformity to the
character and genius of the Prince. To his successor, in the meantime,
Agricola had surrendered the Province now settled in perfect peace and
security. Moreover, to prevent all remarks upon the manner of his entry
into Rome, from any popular distinction paid him, and any concourse of
people to meet him, he utterly declined this observance of his friends,
and came into the city by night; and by night, as he was directed,
went to the palace. He was there received by the Emperor, with a short
embrace, but without a word said; then passed, undistinguished, amongst
the crowd of servile courtiers. Now in order to soften with other
and different virtues the reputation of a military man, a name ever
distasteful to those who live themselves in idleness, he resigned
himself entirely to indolence and repose. In his dress he was modest;
in his conversation courteous and free, and never found accompanied with
more than one or two of his friends. Insomuch that many, such especially
as are wont to judge of great men by their retinue and parade, all
calculated to gain popular admiration, when they had beheld and observed
Agricola, sought to know whence proceeded his mighty fame: there were
indeed but few who could account for the motives of his conduct.

Frequently, during the course of that time, was he accused in his
absence before Domitian, and in his absence also acquitted. What
threatened his life was no crime of his, nor complaint of any particular
for injuries received, nor aught else save the glorious character of
the man, and the spirit of the Emperor hating all excellence and every
virtue. With these causes there concurred the most mischievous sort of
all enemies, they who extolled him in order to destroy him. Moreover in
the Commonwealth there ensued such times as would not permit the name
of Agricola to remain unmentioned: so many were the armies which we had
lost in Moesia, in Dacia, in Germany, in Pannonia; all by the wretched
conduct of our Generals, either altogether impotent or foolhardy:
so many withal were the brave officers, with so many bands of men
overthrown and taken. Neither was the question and contest now about
maintaining the limits of the Empire and guarding the rivers which
served for its boundaries, but about defending the standing encampments
of the legions and preserving our own territories. Thus, when public
misfortunes were following one another in a continual train, when every
year was become signal for calamities and slaughters, Agricola was by
the common voice of the populace required for the command of our armies.
For, all men were comparing his vigour, his firmness, and his mind
trained in war, with the sloth and timidity of the others. With
discourses of this strain, it is certain that even the ears of Domitian
himself were teased; whilst all the best of his freedmen advised and
pressed him to this choice, out of pure affection and duty, as did the
worst out of virulence and envy; and to whatever appeared most malignant
that Prince was ever prone. In this manner was Agricola, as well through
his own virtues as through the base management of others, pushed upon a
precipice even of glory.

A.D. 90. The year was now arrived when to the lot of Agricola was to
fall the Proconsulship of Asia or of Africa: and, as Civica had been
lately murdered (even whilst Proconsul of the former Province), Agricola
was neither unprepared what course to pursue, nor Domitian unfurnished
with an example to follow. It happened too, that certain persons, men
apprised of the secret purposes of the Prince, made it their business
to accost Agricola and ask him, whether he meant in earnest to take
possession of his Province. Nay, they began, at first indeed with some
reserve, to extol a life of tranquillity and repose; anon they proffered
their good offices to procure his demission and excuse: at last,
throwing off all disguise, and proceeding at once to dissuade and to
intimidate him, they prevailed with him to be carried, with this as his
suit, to Domitian. He, already prepared to dissemble his sentiments,
and assuming a mien of haughtiness, not only received the petition of
Agricola to be excused, but when he had granted it, suffered himself
to be presented with formal thanks, Nor was he ashamed of conferring
a grace so unpopular and odious. To Agricola however he gave not the
salary which was wont to be paid to Proconsuls, and which he himself had
continued to some. Whether he were affronted that it was not asked, or
whether restrained by his own guilty mind, lest he might seem to have
purchased with money what he had hindered by his interposition and
power. It is the nature of men, that whomsoever they injure they hate.
Now Domitian was in his temper apt to be suddenly transported into
rage, and, in proportion as he smothered his vengeance, the more
irreconcilable he always certainly proved. Yet by the prudence and
moderation of Agricola, he was softened. For, by no contumacy of his,
nor by any vain ostentation of a spirit of liberty ill-timed, did he
court fame or urge his fate. Let such who are wont to admire things
daring and forbidden, know, that even under evil Princes great men may
be produced, and that by the means of modesty and observance, provided
these be accompanied with application and vigour, they may rise to an
equal measure of public estimation and praise with that of many, who
through a conduct very stubborn and precipitate, but of no advantage to
the Commonweal, have distinguished themselves by dying only to gain a
great name.

A.D. 93. Afflicting to us his family proved the end of his life,
sorrowful to his friends; and even to foreigners and such as knew him
not, matter of trouble and condolence. The commonalty likewise, and
such people as were void of employment, [Footnote: Or it may be thus
translated: "The body of the people though chiefly intent upon such
affairs as concerned not the State."--GORDON. Burnouf is better: "Ce
peuple, qu'occupent d'autres interets."] were not only frequent in
their visits to his house, but in all public places, in all particular
companies made him the subject of their conversation. Nor, when his
death was divulged, was there a soul found who either rejoiced at it,
or presently forgot it. What heightened the public commiseration and
concern, was a prevailing rumour that he was despatched by poison.
That there was any proof of this, I dare not aver. Yet it is true, that
during the whole course of his illness, Domitian caused frequent visits
to be made him, indeed much more frequent than Princes are wont to
make, both by his favourite freedmen and most trusty physicians;
whether through real concern for his health, or solicitude to learn the
probability of his death. It is well known that on the day in which he
expired, continual accounts were, by messengers purposely placed, every
instant transmitted to the Emperor, how fast his end was approaching;
and no one believed, that he would thus quicken such tidings, had he
been to feel any sorrow from hearing them. In his face however and even
in his spirit, he affected to show some guise of grief; for, he was now
secure against the object of his hate, and could more easily dissemble
his present joy, than lately his fear. It was abundantly notorious how
much it rejoiced him, upon reading the last will of Agricola, to find
himself left joint heir with his excellent wife and tender daughter.
This he took to have been done out of judgment and choice, and in
pure honour to himself. So blind and corrupt was his mind rendered by
continual flattery, as not to know, that to no Prince but a bad one will
any good father bequeath his fortune.

Agricola was born on the 13th of June, during the third Consulship
of the Emperor Caligula. He died on the 24th of August, during the
Consulship of Collega and Priscus, in the fifty-sixth year of his age.
If posterity be desirous to know his make and stature; in his person
he was rather genteel and regular than tall. [Footnote: Decentior quam
sublimior fuit.] In his aspect there was nothing terrible. His looks
were extremely graceful and pleasing. A good man you would have readily
believed him, and been glad to have found that he was a great man. Nay,
though he was snatched away whilst his age was yet in full vigour,
if however his life be measured by his glory, he attained to a mighty
length of days. For, every true felicity and acquisition, namely, all
such as arise from virtue, he had already enjoyed to the full. As he had
been likewise dignified with the Consular and triumphal honours, what
more could fortune add to his lustre and renown? After enormous wealth
he sought not: an honourable share he possessed. As behind him he left
surviving his daughter and his wife, he may be even accounted happy;
since by dying whilst his credit was nowise impaired, his fame in its
full splendour, his relations and friends yet in a state of security, he
escaped the evils to come. For, as before us he was wont to express his
wishes, that he might survive to see this truly blessed Age, and Trajan
swaying the sovereignty, wishes which he uttered with presages as of
what would surely ensue; so it was a wondrous consolation attending the
quickness of his death, that thence he evaded the misery of the latter
times, when Domitian, who had ceased to exert his tyranny by starts only
and intermissions, was come now to rend the Commonwealth by cruelties
without all respite, and to overthrow it as it were by one great and
deadly stroke.

For, Agricola saw not the Court of the Senate besieged, nor the Senate
enclosed by armed men, nor the butchery of so many men of Consular
dignity, nor the flight and exile of so many ladies of the prime
nobility, all effected in one continued havoc. Till then Carus Metius,
the accuser, was only considerable for having been victorious in one
bloody process; till then the cruel motions of Messallinus rang only
within the palace at Alba; [Footnote: A country palace of Domitian.] and
in those days Massa Bebius (afterwards so exercised in arraigning the
innocent) was himself arraigned as a criminal. Presently after we, with
our own hands, dragged Helvidius to prison and execution: we beheld the
melancholy doom of Mauricus and Rusticus: we found ourselves besprinkled
with the innocent blood of Senecio. Even Nero withheld his eyes from
scenes of cruelty, he indeed ordered murders to be perpetrated, but saw
not the perpetration. The principal part of our miseries under Domitian,
was to be obliged to see him and be seen by him, at a time when all our
sighs and sorrows were watched and marked down for condemnation; when
that cruel countenance of his, always covered with a settled red, whence
he hardened himself against all shame and blushing, served him to mark
and recount all the pale horrors at once possessing so many men. Thou
therefore, Agricola, art happy, not only as thy life was glorious, but
as thy death was seasonable. According to the account of such who heard
thy last words, thou didst accept thy fate cheerfully and with firmness,
as if thou thus didst thy part to show the Emperor to be guiltless. But
to myself and thy daughter, besides the anguish of having our father
snatched from us, it proves a fresh accession of sorrow, that we had
not an opportunity to attend thee in thy sickness, to solace thy sinking
spirits, to please ourselves with seeing thee, please ourselves
with embracing thee. Doubtless, we should have greedily received thy
instructions and sayings, and engraved them for ever upon our hearts.
This is our woe, this a wound to our spirit, that by the lot of long
absence from thee thou wast already lost to us for four years before thy
death. There is no question, excellent father, but that with whatever
thy condition required thou wast honourably supplied, as thou wast
attended by thy wife, one so full of tenderness for her husband: yet
fewer tears accompanied thy course, and during thy last moments somewhat
was wanting to satisfy thine eyes.

If for the _Manes_ of the just any place be found; if, as philosophers
hold, great spirits perish not with the body, pleasing be thy repose.
Moreover, recall us thy family from this our weakness in regretting
thee, and from these our effeminate wailings, to the contemplation of
thy virtues, for which it were unjust to lament or to mourn. Let us
rather adorn thy memory with deathless praises and (as far as our
infirmities will allow) by pursuing and adopting thy excellencies.
This is true honour, this the natural duty incumbent upon every near
relation. This is also what I would recommend to thy daughter and thy
wife, so to reverence the memory of a father, and a husband, as to be
ever ruminating upon all his doings, upon all his sayings, and rather to
adore his immortal name, rather the image of his mind than that of
his person. Not that I mean to condemn the use of statues, such as
are framed of marble or brass. But as the persons of men are frail and
perishing, so are likewise the portraitures of men. The form of the soul
is eternal, such as you cannot represent and preserve by the craft of
hands or by materials foreign to its nature, nor otherwise than by a
similitude and conformity of manners. Whatever we loved in Agricola,
whatever we admired, remains, and will for ever remain implanted in the
hearts of men, through an eternity of ages, and conveyed down in the
voice of fame, in the record of things. For, many of the great ancients,
by being buried in oblivion, have thence reaped the fate of men
altogether mean and inglorious: but Agricola shall ever survive in his
history here composed and transmitted to posterity.
