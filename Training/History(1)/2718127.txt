MONTGOMERY'S
LEADING FACTS OF American History.

Within the first fifteen months after issue, the publishers were
obliged to go to press with the
... 295,000th copy ...

It was almost immediately adopted for exclusive use in the State of
Indiana, and by such cities as Chicago, Ill., Philadelphia, Pa.,
Boston, Mass., Providence, R.I., Hartford, Conn., Columbus and
Cleveland, O., Burlington, Vt., Nashua, N.H., Lynn, Mass., and
numberless others.

IT IS CERTAINLY THE BEST.

_The Leading Facts of American History_.

Few text-books have met with such immediate recognition as this.
Though published late in the summer of 1890, it was, within a few
months, adopted by such cities as Philadelphia, Chicago, Providence,
R.I., Burlington, Vt., Lynn, Mass., by counties, and by numberless
institutions. It seems to be regarded by the best judges as, on the
whole, the best school history of the United States yet published.
It was written and not simply compiled. The author did not take it
for granted that a history of our country must be a perfunctory work
made up from previous histories and merely iterating an old set of
facts, ideas, and stories. The book is a panorama of the leading
events of our history, with their causes and results clearly traced.
Attention has been given to all the departments of American life and
activity. It describes the development of the American people. The
author's broad and liberal sympathies saved him from sectarian,
sectional, or partisan views. The style is full of life, and the words
can all be understood by the pupils for whom the book is designed.

P. V. N. Myers, _author of General History, etc._: I have read it
carefully, and with great interest. It is in every way admirable.

George A. Walton, _Agent Mass. State Board of Education_: It is as
interesting as romance. It is instructive, especially on matters
pertaining to the customs of the people, and to their methods of
advancing their welfare. With these excellences, it must prove also
a book that will teach.

This book tells the story of the nation in thirty biographies of its
most representative men. It is entirely free from sectional or other
bias, and its beautiful make-up renders it doubly attractive to its
young students. (See _Common School Catalogue_.)
