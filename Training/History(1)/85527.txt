coins and to spare; but he did not even take the ring out of her hand.
He merely glanced at it, and said gravely:

"Nay, my little maid, we do not do business with children."

"But I want the money, Gamaliel," she urged.  "I must have it."

"Must?"  he repeated with a smile.  "Well, must is a nail that drives
through wood, no doubt; but if it hits iron it is apt to bend.  Not that
I am so hard as that; but money, money, money!  And whose money do you
mean, little maid?  If you want money of mine to spend in bread, or in
cakes, which is more likely, I will shut my eyes and put my hand boldly
into my wallet; but, if I am not mistaken, you are well provided for by
Rufinus the Greek, in whose house there is no lack of anything; and I
have a nice round sum in my own keeping which your grandfather placed in
my hands at interest two years since, with a remark that it was a legacy
to you from your godmother, and the papers stand in your name; so your
necessity looks very like what other folks would call ease."

"Necessity!  I am in no necessity," Mary broke in.  "But I want the money
all the same; and if I have some of my own, and you perhaps have it there
in your box, give me as much of it as I want."

"As much as you want?"  laughed the jeweller.  "Not so fast, little maid.
Before such matters can be settled here in Egypt we must have plenty of
time, and papyrus and ink, a grand law court, sixteen witnesses, a
Kyrios.  .  ."

"Well then, buy the ring!  You are such a good, kind man Gamaliel.  Just
to please me.  Why, you yourself do not really think that I want to buy
cakes!"

"No.  But in these hard times, when so many are starving, a soft heart
may be moved to other follies."

"No indeed!  Do buy the ring; and if you will do me this favor.  .  ."

"Old Gamaliel will be both a rogue and a simpleton!--Have you forgotten
the emerald?  I bought that, and a pretty piece of business that was!
I can have nothing to say to the ring, my little maid."  Mary withdrew
her hand, and the grief and disappointment expressed by her large,
tearful eyes were so bitter and touching, that the Jew paused, and then
went on seriously and heartily:

"I would sooner give my own old head to be an anvil than distress you,
sweet child; and Adonai!  I do not mean to say--why should I--that you
should ever leave old Gamaliel without money.  He has plenty, and though
he is always ready to take, he is ready to give, too, when it is meet and
fitting.  I cannot buy the ring, to be sure, but do not be down-hearted
and look me well in the face, little maid.  It is much to ask, and I have
handsomer things in my stores, but if you see anything in it that gives
you confidence, speak out and whisper to the man of whom even your
grandfather had some good opinion: 'I want so much, and what is more--how
did you put it?--what is more, I must have it.'"

Mary did see something in the Jew's merry round face that inspired her
with trust, and in her childlike belief in the sanctity of an oath she
made a third person--a believer too, in a third form of religion--swear
not to betray her secret, only marvelling that the administering of the
oath, in which she had now had some practice, should be so easy.  Even
grown-up people will sometimes buy another's dearest secret for a light
asseveration.  And when she had thus ensured the Israelite's silence, she
confided to him that she was charged by Orion to send out a messenger to
meet Amru, that he and Paula might be reprieved in time.  The goldsmith
listened attentively, and even before she had ended he was busying
himself with an iron chest built into the wall, and interrupted her to
ask!  "How much?"

She named the sum that Nilus had suggested, and hardly had she finished
her story when the Jew, who kept the trick by which he opened the chest a
secret even from his wife, exclaimed:

"Now, go and look out of the window, you wonder among envoys and money-
borrowers, and if you see nothing in the courtyard, then fancy to
yourself that a man is standing there who looks like old Gamaliel, and
who puts his hand on your head and gives you a good kiss.  And you may
fancy him, too, as saying to himself: 'God in Heaven! if only my little
daughter, my Ruth may be such another as little Mary, grandchild of the
just Mukaukas!'"

And as he spoke, the vivacious but stout man, who had dropped on his
knees, rose panting, left the lid of his strong box open, hurried up to
the child, who had been standing at the window all the while, and bending
over her from behind pressed a kiss on her curly head, saying with a
laugh: "There, little pickpocket, that is my interest.  But look out
still, till I call you again."  He nimbly trotted back on his short
little legs, wiping his eyes; took from the strong box a little bag of
gold, which contained rather more than the desired sum, locked the chest
again, looking at Mary with a mixture of suspicion and hearty
approbation; then at last he called her to him.  He emptied the money-bag
before her, counted out the sum she needed, put the remainder of the
coins into his girdle, and handed the bag to the little girl requesting
her to count his "advance", back into it, while he, with a cunning smile,
quitted the room.

He presently returned and she had finished her task, but she timidly
observed: "One gold piece is wanting."  At this he clasped his hands over
his breast and raised his eyes to Heaven exclaiming: "My God! what a
child.  There is the solidus, child; and you may take my word for it as a
man of experience: whatever you undertake will prosper.  You know what
you are about; and when you are grown up and a suitor comes he will go to
a good market.  And now sign your name here.  You are not of age, to be
sure, and the receipt is worth no more than any other note scribbled with
ink--however, it is according to rule."

Mary took the pen, but she first hastily glanced through what Gamaliel
had written; the Jew broke out in fresh enthusiasm:

"A girl--a mere child!  And she reads, and considers, and makes all sure
before she will sign!  God bless thee, Child!--And here come the tarts,
and you can taste them before...  Just Heaven! a mere child, and such
important business!"

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
