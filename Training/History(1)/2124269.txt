      To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.                            50
    Soft! ask no questions. Give no vent to thought,
    Such is the custom of the Pow'rs divine.
    Hence, thou, to bed. I stay, that I may yet
    Both in thy mother and her maidens move
    More curiosity; yes--she with tears
    Shall question me of all that I have seen.
      He ended, and the Prince, at his command,
    Guided by flaming torches, sought the couch
    Where he was wont to sleep, and there he slept
    On that night also, waiting the approach                          60
    Of sacred dawn. Thus was Ulysses left
    Alone, and planning sat in solitude,
    By Pallas' aid, the slaughter of his foes.
      At length, Diana-like, or like herself,
    All golden Venus, (her apartment left)
    Enter'd Penelope. Beside the hearth
    Her women planted her accustom'd seat
    With silver wreathed and ivory. That throne
    Icmalius made, artist renown'd, and join'd
    A footstool to its splendid frame beneath,                        70
    Which ever with an ample fleece they spread.
    There sat discrete Penelope; then came
    Her beautiful attendants from within,
    Who cleared the litter'd bread, the board, and cups
    From which the insolent companions drank.
    They also raked the embers from the hearths
    Now dim, and with fresh billets piled them high,
    Both for illumination and for warmth.
    Then yet again Melantho with rude speech
    Opprobrious, thus, assail'd Ulysses' ear.                         80
      Guest--wilt thou trouble us throughout the night
    Ranging the house? and linger'st thou a spy
    Watching the women? Hence--get thee abroad
    Glad of such fare as thou hast found, or soon
    With torches beaten we will thrust thee forth.
      To whom Ulysses, frowning stern, replied.
    Petulant woman! wherefore thus incensed
    Inveigh'st thou against me? is it because
    I am not sleek? because my garb is mean?
    Because I beg? thanks to necessity--                              90
    I would not else. But such as I appear,
    Such all who beg and all who wander are.
    I also lived the happy owner once
    Of such a stately mansion, and have giv'n
    To num'rous wand'rers, whencesoe'er they came,
    All that they needed; I was also served
    By many, and enjoy'd all that denotes
    The envied owner opulent and blest.
    But Jove (for so it pleas'd him) hath reduced
    My all to nothing. Therefore well beware                         100
    Thou also, mistress, lest a day arrive
    When all these charms by which thou shin'st among
    Thy sister-menials, fade; fear, too, lest her
    Thou should'st perchance irritate, whom thou serv'st,
    And lest Ulysses come, of whose return
    Hope yet survives; but even though the Chief
    Have perish'd, as ye think, and comes no more,
    Consider yet his son, how bright the gifts
    Shine of Apollo in the illustrious Prince
    Telemachus; no woman, unobserved                                 110
    By him, can now commit a trespass here;
    His days of heedless infancy are past.
      He ended, whom Penelope discrete
    O'erhearing, her attendant sharp rebuked.
      Shameless, audacious woman! known to me
    Is thy great wickedness, which with thy life
    Thou shalt atone; for thou wast well aware,
    (Hearing it from myself) that I design'd
    To ask this stranger of my absent Lord,
    For whose dear sake I never cease to mourn.                      120
      Then to her household's governess she said.
    Bring now a seat, and spread it with a fleece,
    Eurynome! that, undisturb'd, the guest
    May hear and answer all that I shall ask.
      She ended. Then the matron brought in haste
    A polish'd seat, and spread it with a fleece,
    On which the toil-accustom'd Hero sat,
    And thus the chaste Penelope began.
      Stranger! my first enquiry shall be this--
    Who art thou? whence? where born? and sprung from whom?          130
      Then answer thus Ulysses, wise, return'd.
    O Queen! uncensurable by the lips
    Of mortal man! thy glory climbs the skies
    Unrivall'd, like the praise of some great King
    Who o'er a num'rous people and renown'd
    Presiding like a Deity, maintains
    Justice and truth. The earth, under his sway,
    Her produce yields abundantly; the trees
    Fruit-laden bend; the lusty flocks bring forth;
    The Ocean teems with finny swarms beneath                        140
    His just controul, and all the land is blest.
    Me therefore, question of what else thou wilt
    In thy own palace, but forbear to ask
    From whom I sprang, and of my native land,
    Lest thou, reminding me of those sad themes,
    Augment my woes; for I have much endured;
    Nor were it seemly, in another's house,
    To pass the hours in sorrow and in tears,
    Wearisome when indulg'd with no regard
    To time or place; thy train (perchance thyself)                  150
    Would blame me, and I should reproach incur
    As one tear-deluged through excess of wine.
      Him answer'd then Penelope discrete.
    The immortal Gods, O stranger, then destroy'd
    My form, my grace, my beauty, when the Greeks
    Whom my Ulysses follow'd, sail'd to Troy.
    Could he, returning, my domestic charge
    Himself intend, far better would my fame
    Be so secured, and wider far diffused.
    But I am wretched now, such storms of woe                        160
    The Gods have sent me; for as many Chiefs
    As hold dominion in the neighbour isles
    Samos, Dulichium, and the forest-crown'd
    Zacynthus; others, also, rulers here
    In pleasant Ithaca, me, loth to wed,
    Woo ceaseless, and my household stores consume.
    I therefore, neither guest nor suppliant heed,
    Nor public herald more, but with regret
    Of my Ulysses wear my soul away.
    They, meantime, press my nuptials, which by art                  170
    I still procrastinate. Some God the thought
    Suggested to me, to commence a robe
    Of amplest measure and of subtlest woof,
    Laborious task; which done, I thus address'd them.
    Princes, my suitors! since the noble Chief
    Ulysses is no more, enforce not now
    My nuptials; wait till I shall finish first
    A fun'ral robe (lest all my threads be marr'd)
    Which for the ancient Hero I prepare
    Laertes, looking for the mournful hour                           180
    When fate shall snatch him to eternal rest.
    Else, I the censure dread of all my sex,
    Should he, so wealthy, want at last a shroud.
    Such was my speech; they, unsuspicious all,
    With my request complied. Thenceforth, all day
    I wove the ample web, and, by the aid
    Of torches, ravell'd it again at night.
    Three years by artifice I thus their suit
    Eluded safe; but when the fourth arrived,
    And the same season after many moons                             190
    And fleeting days return'd, passing my train
    Who had neglected to release the dogs,
    They came, surprized and reprimanded me.
    Thus, through necessity, not choice, at last
    I have perform'd it, in my own despight.
    But no escape from marriage now remains,
    Nor other subterfuge for me; meantime
    My parents urge my nuptials, and my son
    (Of age to note it) with disgust observes
    His wealth consumed; for he is now become                        200
    Adult, and abler than myself to rule
    The house, a Prince distinguish'd by the Gods,
    Yet, stranger, after all, speak thy descent;
    Say whence thou art; for not of fabulous birth
    Art thou, nor from the oak, nor from the rock.
      Her answer'd then Ulysses, ever-wise.
    O spouse revered of Laertiades!
    Resolv'st thou still to learn from whom I sprang?
    Learn then; but know that thou shalt much augment
    My present grief, natural to a man                               210
    Who hath, like me, long exiled from his home
    Through various cities of the sons of men
    Wander'd remote, and num'rous woes endured.
    Yet, though it pain me, I will tell thee all.
      There is a land amid the sable flood
    Call'd Crete; fair, fruitful, circled by the sea.
    Num'rous are her inhabitants, a race
    Not to be summ'd, and ninety towns she boasts.
    Diverse their language is; Achaians some,
    And some indigenous are; Cydonians there,                        220
    Crest-shaking Dorians, and Pelasgians dwell.
    One city in extent the rest exceeds,
    Cnossus; the city in which Minos reign'd,
    Who, ever at a nine years' close, conferr'd
    With Jove himself; from him my father sprang
    The brave Deucalion; for Deucalion's sons
    Were two, myself and King Idomeneus.
    To Ilium he, on board his gallant barks,
    Follow'd the Atridae. I, the youngest-born,
    By my illustrious name, AEthon, am known,                         230
    But he ranks foremost both in worth and years.
    There I beheld Ulysses, and within
    My walls receiv'd him; for a violent wind
    Had driv'n him from Malea (while he sought
    The shores of Troy) to Crete. The storm his barks
    Bore into the Amnisus, for the cave
    Of Ilythia known, a dang'rous port,
    And which with difficulty he attain'd.
    He, landing, instant to the city went,
    Seeking Idomeneus; his friend of old,                            240
    As he affirm'd, and one whom much he lov'd.
    But _he_ was far remote, ten days advanced,
    Perhaps eleven, on his course to Troy.
    Him, therefore, I conducted to my home,
    Where hospitably, and with kindest care
    I entertain'd him, (for I wanted nought)
    And for himself procured and for his band,--
    By public contribution, corn, and wine,
    And beeves for food, that all might be sufficed.
    Twelve days his noble Greecians there abode,                     250
    Port-lock'd by Boreas blowing with a force
    Resistless even on the land, some God
    So roused his fury; but the thirteenth day
    The wind all fell, and they embark'd again.
      With many a fiction specious, as he sat,
    He thus her ear amused; she at the sound
    Melting, with fluent tears her cheeks bedew'd;
    And as the snow by Zephyrus diffused,
    Melts on the mountain tops, when Eurus breathes,
    And fills the channels of the running streams,                   260
    So melted she, and down her lovely cheeks
    Pour'd fast the tears, him mourning as remote
    Who sat beside her. Soft compassion touch'd
    Ulysses of his consort's silent woe;
    His eyes as they had been of steel or horn,
    Moved not, yet artful, he suppress'd his tears,
    And she, at length with overflowing grief
    Satiate, replied, and thus enquired again.
      Now, stranger, I shall prove thee, as I judge,
    If thou, indeed, hast entertain'd in Crete                       270
    My spouse and his brave followers, as thou say'st.
    Describe his raiment and himself; his own
    Appearance, and the appearance of his friends.
      Then her Ulysses answer'd, ever-wise.
    Hard is the task, O Queen! (so long a time
    Hath since elaps'd) to tell thee. Twenty years
    Have pass'd since he forsook my native isle,
    Yet, from my best remembrance, I will give
    A likeness of him, such as now I may.
    A double cloak, thick-piled, Moeonian dyed,                      280
    The noble Chief had on; two fast'nings held
    The golden clasp, and it display'd in front
    A well-wrought pattern with much art design'd.
    An hound between his fore-feet holding fast
    A dappled fawn, gaped eager on his prey.
    All wonder'd, seeing, how in lifeless gold
    Express'd, the dog with open mouth her throat
    Attempted still, and how the fawn with hoofs
    Thrust trembling forward, struggled to escape.
    That glorious mantle much I noticed, soft                        290
    To touch, as the dried garlick's glossy film;
    Such was the smoothness of it, and it shone
    Sun-bright; full many a maiden, trust me, view'd
    The splendid texture with admiring eyes.
    But mark me now; deep treasure in thy mind
    This word. I know not if Ulysses wore
    That cloak at home, or whether of his train
    Some warrior gave it to him on his way,
    Or else some host of his; for many loved
    Ulysses, and with him might few compare.                         300
    I gave to him, myself, a brazen sword,
    A purple cloak magnificent, and vest
    Of royal length, and when he sought his bark,
    With princely pomp dismiss'd him from the shore.
    An herald also waited on the Chief,
    Somewhat his Senior; him I next describe.
    His back was bunch'd, his visage swarthy, curl'd
    His poll, and he was named Eurybates;
    A man whom most of all his followers far
    Ulysses honour'd, for their minds were one.                      310
      He ceased; she recognising all the proofs
    Distinctly by Ulysses named, was moved
    Still more to weep, till with o'erflowing grief
    Satiate, at length she answer'd him again.
      Henceforth, O stranger, thou who hadst before
    My pity, shalt my rev'rence share and love,
    I folded for him (with these hands) the cloak
    Which thou describ'st, produced it when he went,
    And gave it to him; I that splendid clasp
    Attach'd to it myself, more to adorn                             320
    My honour'd Lord, whom to his native land
    Return'd secure I shall receive no more.
    In such an evil hour Ulysses went
    To that bad city never to be named.
      To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.
    Consort revered of Laertiades!
    No longer let anxiety impair
    Thy beauteous form, nor any grief consume
    Thy spirits more for thy Ulysses' sake.
    And yet I blame thee not; a wife deprived                        330
    Of her first mate to whom she had produced
    Fair fruit of mutual love, would mourn his loss,
    Although he were inferior far to thine,
    Whom fame affirms the semblance of the Gods.
    But cease to mourn. Hear me. I will relate
    A faithful tale, nor will from thee withhold
    Such tidings of Ulysses living still,
    And of his safe return, as I have heard
    Lately, in yon neighb'ring opulent land
    Of the Thesprotians. He returns enrich'd                         340
    With many precious stores from those obtain'd
    Whom he hath visited; but he hath lost,
    Departing from Thrinacia's isle, his bark
    And all his lov'd companions in the Deep,
    For Jove was adverse to him, and the Sun,
    Whose beeves his followers slew. They perish'd all
    Amid the billowy flood; but Him, the keel
    Bestriding of his bark, the waves at length
    Cast forth on the Phaeacian's land, a race
    Allied to heav'n, who rev'renced like a God                      350
    Thy husband, honour'd him with num'rous gifts,
    And willing were to have convey'd him home.
    Ulysses, therefore, had attained long since
    His native shore, but that he deem'd it best
    To travel far, that he might still amass
    More wealth; so much Ulysses all mankind
    Excels in policy, and hath no peer.
    This information from Thesprotia's King
    I gain'd, from Phidon; to myself he swore,
    Libation off'ring under his own roof,                            360
    That both the bark was launch'd, and the stout crew
    Prepared, that should conduct him to his home.
    But me he first dismiss'd; for, as it chanced,
    A ship lay there of the Thesprotians, bound
    To corn-enrich'd Dulichium. All the wealth
    He shew'd me by the Chief amass'd, a store
    To feed the house of yet another Prince
    To the tenth generation; so immense
    His treasures were within that palace lodg'd.
    Himself he said was to Dodona gone,                              370
    Counsel to ask from the oracular oaks
    Sublime of Jove, how safest he might seek,
    After long exile thence, his native land,
    If openly were best, or in disguise.
    Thus, therefore, he is safe, and at his home
    Well-nigh arrived, nor shall his country long
    Want him. I swear it with a solemn oath.
    First Jove be witness, King and Lord of all!
    Next these domestic Gods of the renown'd
    Ulysses, in whose royal house I sit,                             380
    That thou shalt see my saying all fulfill'd.
    Ulysses shall this self-same year return,
    This self-same month, ere yet the next begin.
      Him answer'd then Penelope discrete.
    Grant heav'n, my guest, that this good word of thine
    Fail not! then, soon shalt thou such bounty share
    And friendship at my hands, that, at first sight,
    Whoe'er shall meet thee shall pronounce thee blest.
    But ah! my soul forebodes how it will prove;
    Neither Ulysses will return, nor thou                            390
    Receive safe conduct hence; for we have here
    None, such as once Ulysses was, to rule
    His household with authority, and to send
    With honourable convoy to his home
    The worthy guest, or to regale him here.
    Give him the bath, my maidens; spread his couch
    With linen soft, with fleecy gaberdines[82]
    And rugs of splendid hue, that he may lie
    Waiting, well-warm'd, the golden morn's return.
    Attend him also at the peep of day                               400
    With bath and unction, that, his seat resumed
    Here in the palace, he may be prepared
    For breakfast with Telemachus; and woe
    To him who shall presume to incommode
    Or cause him pain; that man shall be cashier'd
    Hence instant, burn his anger as it may.
    For how, my honour'd inmate! shalt thou learn
    That I in wisdom oeconomic aught
    Pass other women, if unbathed, unoiled,
    Ill-clad, thou sojourn here? man's life is short,                410
    Whoso is cruel, and to cruel arts
    Addict, on him all men, while yet he lives,
    Call plagues and curses down, and after death
    Scorn and proverbial mock'ries hunt his name.
    But men, humane themselves, and giv'n by choice
    To offices humane, from land to land
    Are rumour'd honourably by their guests,
    And ev'ry tongue is busy in their praise.
      Her answer'd then, Ulysses, ever-wise.
    Consort revered of Laertiades!                                   420
    Warm gaberdines and rugs of splendid hue
    To me have odious been, since first the sight
    Of Crete's snow-mantled mountain-tops I lost,
    Sweeping the billows with extended oars.
    No; I will pass, as I am wont to pass
    The sleepless night; for on a sordid couch
    Outstretch'd, full many a night have I reposed
    Till golden-charioted Aurora dawn'd.
    Nor me the foot-bath pleases more; my foot
    Shall none of all thy ministring maidens touch,                  430
    Unless there be some ancient matron grave
    Among them, who hath pangs of heart endured
    Num'rous, and keen as I have felt myself;
    Her I refuse not. She may touch my feet.
      Him answer'd then prudent Penelope.
    Dear guest! for of all trav'llers here arrived
    From distant regions, I have none received
    Discrete as thou, or whom I more have lov'd,
    So just thy matter is, and with such grace
    Express'd. I have an ancient maiden grave,                       440
    The nurse who at my hapless husband's birth
    Receiv'd him in her arms, and with kind care
    Maternal rear'd him; she shall wash thy feet,
    Although decrepid. Euryclea, rise!
    Wash one coeval with thy Lord; for such
    The feet and hands, it may be, are become
    Of my Ulysses now; since man beset
    With sorrow once, soon wrinkled grows and old.
      She said, then Euryclea with both hands
    Cov'ring her face, in tepid tears profuse                        450
    Dissolved, and thus in mournful strains began.
      Alas! my son, trouble for thy dear sake
    Distracts me. Jove surely of all mankind
    Thee hated most, though ever in thy heart
    Devoutly giv'n; for never mortal man
    So many thighs of fatted victims burn'd,
    And chosen hecatombs produced as thou
    To Jove the Thund'rer, him entreating still
    That he would grant thee a serene old age,
    And to instruct, thyself, thy glorious son.                      460
    Yet thus the God requites thee, cutting off
    All hope of thy return--oh ancient sir!
    Him too, perchance, where'er he sits a guest
    Beneath some foreign roof, the women taunt,
    As all these shameless ones have taunted thee,
    Fearing whose mock'ry thou forbidd'st their hands
    This office, which Icarius' daughter wise
    To me enjoins, and which I, glad perform.
    Yes, I will wash thy feet; both for her sake
    And for thy own,--for sight of thee hath raised                  470
    A tempest in my mind. Hear now the cause!
    Full many a guest forlorn we entertain,
    But never any have I seen, whose size,
    The fashion of whose foot and pitch of voice,
    Such likeness of Ulysses show'd, as thine.
      To whom Ulysses, ever-shrewd, replied.
    Such close similitude, O ancient dame!
    As thou observ'st between thy Lord and me,
    All, who have seen us both, have ever found.
      He said; then taking the resplendent vase                      480
    Allotted always to that use, she first
    Infused cold water largely, then, the warm.
    Ulysses (for beside the hearth he sat)
    Turn'd quick his face into the shade, alarm'd
    Lest, handling him, she should at once remark
    His scar, and all his stratagem unveil.
    She then, approaching, minister'd the bath
    To her own King, and at first touch discern'd
    That token, by a bright-tusk'd boar of old
    Impress'd, what time he to Parnassus went                        490
    To visit there Autolycus and his sons,
    His mother's noble sire, who all mankind
    In furtive arts and fraudful oaths excell'd.[83]
    For such endowments he by gift receiv'd
    From Hermes' self, to whom the thighs of kids
    He offer'd and of lambs, and, in return,
    The watchful Hermes never left his side.
    Autolycus arriving in the isle
    Of pleasant Ithaca, the new-born son
    Of his own daughter found, whom on his knees                     500
    At close of supper Euryclea placed,
    And thus the royal visitant address'd.
      Thyself, Autolycus! devise a name
    For thy own daughter's son, by num'rous pray'rs
    Of thine and fervent, from the Gods obtained.
      Then answer thus Autolycus return'd.
    My daughter and my daughter's spouse! the name
    Which I shall give your boy, that let him bear.
    Since after provocation and offence
    To numbers giv'n of either sex, I come,                          510
    Call him Ulysses;[84] and when, grown mature,
    He shall Parnassus visit, the abode
    Magnificent in which his mother dwelt,
    And where my treasures lie, from my own stores
    I will enrich and send him joyful home.
      Ulysses, therefore, that he might obtain
    Those princely gifts, went thither. Him arrived,
    With right-hand gratulation and with words
    Of welcome kind, Autolycus received,
    Nor less his offspring; but the mother most                      520
    Of his own mother clung around his neck,
    Amphithea; she with many a fervent kiss
    His forehead press'd, and his bright-beaming eyes.
    Then bade Autolycus his noble sons
    Set forth a banquet. They, at his command,
    Led in a fatted ox of the fifth year,
    Which slaying first, they spread him carved abroad,
    Then scored his flesh, transfixed it with the spits,
    And roasting all with culinary skill
    Exact, gave each his portion. Thus they sat                      530
    Feasting all day, and till the sun declined,
    But when the sun declined, and darkness fell,
    Each sought his couch, and took the gift of sleep.
    Then, soon as day-spring's daughter rosy-palm'd
    Aurora look'd abroad, forth went the hounds,
    And, with the hounds Ulysses, and the youths,
    Sons of Autolycus, to chase the boar.
    Arrived at the Parnassian mount, they climb'd
    His bushy sides, and to his airy heights
    Ere long attain'd. It was the pleasant hour                      540
    When from the gently-swelling flood profound
    The sun, emerging, first smote on the fields.
    The hunters reach'd the valley; foremost ran,
    Questing, the hounds; behind them, swift, the sons
    Came of Autolycus, with whom advanced
    The illustrious Prince Ulysses, pressing close
    The hounds, and brandishing his massy spear.
    There, hid in thickest shades, lay an huge boar.
    That covert neither rough winds blowing moist
    Could penetrate, nor could the noon-day sun                      550
    Smite through it, or fast-falling show'rs pervade,
    So thick it was, and underneath the ground
    With litter of dry foliage strew'd profuse.
    Hunters and dogs approaching him, his ear
    The sound of feet perceived; upridging high
    His bristly back and glaring fire, he sprang
    Forth from the shrubs, and in defiance stood
    Near and right opposite. Ulysses, first,
    Rush'd on him, elevating his long spear
    Ardent to wound him; but, preventing quick                       560
    His foe, the boar gash'd him above the knee.
    Much flesh, assailing him oblique, he tore
    With his rude tusk, but to the Hero's bone
    Pierced not; Ulysses _his_ right shoulder reach'd;
    And with a deadly thrust impell'd the point
    Of his bright spear through him and far beyond.
    Loud yell'd the boar, sank in the dust, and died.
    Around Ulysses, then, the busy sons
    Throng'd of Autolycus; expert they braced
    The wound of the illustrious hunter bold,                        570
    With incantation staunched the sable blood,
    And sought in haste their father's house again,
    Whence, heal'd and gratified with splendid gifts
    They sent him soon rejoicing to his home,
    Themselves rejoicing also. Glad their son
    His parents saw again, and of the scar
    Enquired, where giv'n, and how? He told them all,
    How to Parnassus with his friends he went,
    Sons of Autolycus to hunt, and how
    A boar had gash'd him with his iv'ry tusk.                       580
      That scar, while chafing him with open palms,
    The matron knew; she left his foot to fall;
    Down dropp'd his leg into the vase; the brass
    Rang, and o'ertilted by the sudden shock,
    Poured forth the water, flooding wide the floor.
    _Her_ spirit joy at once and sorrow seized;
    Tears fill'd her eyes; her intercepted voice
    Died in her throat; but to Ulysses' beard
    Her hand advancing, thus, at length, she spake.
      Thou art himself, Ulysses. Oh my son!                          590
    Dear to me, and my master as thou art,
    I knew thee not, till I had touch'd the scar.
      She said, and to Penelope her eyes
    Directed, all impatient to declare
    Her own Ulysses even then at home.
    But she, nor eye nor ear for aught that pass'd
    Had then, her fixt attention so entire
    Minerva had engaged. Then, darting forth
    His arms, the Hero with his right-hand close
    Compress'd her throat, and nearer to himself                     600
    Drawing her with his left, thus caution'd her.
      Why would'st thou ruin me? Thou gav'st me milk
    Thyself from thy own breast. See me return'd
    After long suff'rings, in the twentieth year,
    To my own land. But since (some God the thought
    Suggesting to thee) thou hast learn'd the truth,
    Silence! lest others learn it from thy lips.
    For this I say, nor shall the threat be vain;
    If God vouchsafe to me to overcome
    The haughty suitors, when I shall inflict                        610
    Death on the other women of my house,
    Although my nurse, thyself shalt also die.
      Him answer'd Euryclea then, discrete.
    My son! oh how could so severe a word
    Escape thy lips? my fortitude of mind
    Thou know'st, and even now shalt prove me firm
    As iron, secret as the stubborn rock.
    But hear and mark me well. Should'st thou prevail,
    Assisted by a Pow'r divine, to slay
    The haughty suitors, I will then, myself,                        620
    Give thee to know of all the female train
    Who have dishonour'd thee, and who respect.
      To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.
    My nurse, it were superfluous; spare thy tongue
    That needless task. I can distinguish well
