Commander of the Carpathia, which rescued the survivors of the Titanic
from the life-boats in the open sea and brought them to New York. After
the Senatorial Investigating Committee had examined Captain Rostrom, at
which time this specially posed photograph was taken, Senator William
Alden Smith, chairman of the committee, said of Captain Rostrom: "His
conduct of the rescue shows that he is not only an efficient seaman, but
one of nature's noblemen."}


not thought of danger. Later we were told to get up, and I hurriedly
dressed the baby. We hastened up on deck, and confusion was all about.
With other women and children we clambered to the life-boats, just as a
matter of precaution, believing that there was no immediate danger.
In about an hour there was an explosion and the ship appeared to fall
apart. We were in the life-boat about six hours before we were picked
up."


THE RYERSON FAMILY

Probably few deaths have caused more tears than Arthur Ryerson's, in
view of the sad circumstances which called him home from a lengthy
tour in Europe. Mr. Ryerson's eldest son, Arthur Larned Ryerson, a Yale
student, was killed in an automobile accident Easter Monday, 1912.

A cablegram announcing the death plunged the Ryerson family into
mourning and they boarded the first steamship for this country. If{sic}
happened to be the Titanic, and the death note came near being the cause
of the blotting out of the entire family.

The children who accompanied them were Miss Susan P. Ryerson, Miss Emily
B. Ryerson and John Ryerson. The latter is 12 years old.

They did not know their son intended to spend the Easter holidays at
their home at Haverford, Pa. until they were informed of his death. John
Lewis Hoffman, also of Haverford and a student of Yale, was killed with
young Ryerson.

The two were hurrying to Philadelphia to escort a fellow-student to his
train. In turning out of the road to pass a cart the motor car crashed
into a pole in front of the entrance to the estate of Mrs. B. Frank
Clyde. The college men were picked up unconscious and died in the Bryn
Mawr Hospital.

G. Heide Norris of Philadelphia, who went to New York to meet the
surviving members of the Ryerson family, told of a happy incident at the
last moment as the Carpathia swung close to the pier. There had been
no positive information that young "Jack" Ryerson was among those
saved--indeed, it was feared that he had gone down with the Titanic,
like his father, Arthur Ryerson.

Mr. Norris spoke of the feeling of relief that came over him as,
watching from the pier, he saw "Jack" Ryerson come from a cabin and
stand at the railing. The name of the boy was missing from some of the
lists and for two days it was reported that he had perished.


CAPTAIN ROSTRON'S REPORT

Less than 24 hours after the Cunard Line steamship Carpathia came in as
a rescue ship with survivors of the Titanic disaster, she sailed again
for the Mediterranean cruise which she originally started upon last
week. Just before the liner sailed, H. S. Bride, the second Marconi
wireless operator of the Titanic, who had both of his legs crushed on
a life-boat, was carried off on the shoulders of the ship's officers to
St. Vincent's Hospital.

Captain A. H. Rostron, of the Carpathia, addressed an official report,
giving his account of the Carpathia's rescue work, to the general
manager of the Cunard Line, Liverpool. The report read: "I beg to report
that at 12.35 A. M. Monday 18th inst. I was informed of urgent message
from Titanic with her position. I immediately ordered ship turned around
and put her in course for that position, we being then 58 miles S.
52--E. 'T' from her; had heads of all departments called and issued
what I considered the necessary orders, to be in preparation for any
emergency.

"At 2.40 A. M. saw flare half a point on port bow. Taking this for
granted to be ship, shortly after we sighted our first iceberg. I had
previously had lookouts doubled, knowing that Titanic had struck ice,
and so took every care and precaution. We soon found ourselves in a
field of bergs, and had to alter course several times to clear bergs;
weather fine, and clear, light air on sea, beautifully clear night,
though dark.

"We stopped at 4 A. M., thus doing distance in three hours and a half,
picking up the first boat at 4.10 A. M.; boat in charge of officer, and
he reported that Titanic had foundered. At 8.30 A. M. last boat picked
up. All survivors aboard and all boats accounted for, viz., fifteen
life-boats, one boat abandoned, two Berthon boats alongside (saw one
floating upwards among wreckage), and according to second officer
(senior officer saved) one Berthon boat had not been launched, it having
got jammed, making sixteen life-boats and four Berthon boats accounted
for. By the time we had cleared first boat it was breaking day, and
I could see all within area of four miles. We also saw that we were
surrounded by icebergs, large and small, huge field of drift ice with
large and small bergs in it, the ice field trending from N. W. round W.
and S. to S. E., as far as we could see either way.

"At 8 A. M. the Leyland S. S. California came up. I gave him the
principal news and asked him to search and I would proceed to New
York; at 8.50 proceeded full speed while researching over vicinity of
disaster, and while we were getting people aboard I gave orders to get
spare hands along and swing in all our boats, disconnect the fall and
hoist up as many Titanic boats as possible in our davits; also get
some on forecastle heads by derricks. We got thirteen lifeboats, six on
forward deck and seven in davits. After getting all survivors aboard
and while searching I got a clergyman to offer a short prayer of
thankfulness for those saved, and also a short burial service for their
loss, in saloon.

"Before deciding definitely where to make for, I conferred with Mr.
Ismay, and as he told me to do what I thought best, I informed him,
I considered New York best. I knew we should require clean blankets,
provisions and clean linen, even if we went to the Azores, as most of
the passsengers{sic} saved were women and children, and they hysterical,
not knowing what medical attention they might require. I thought it best
to go to New York. I also thought it would be better for Mr. Ismay to go
to New York or England as soon as possible, and knowing I should be out
of wireless communication very soon if I proceeded to Azores, it left
Halifax, Boston and New York, so I chose the latter.

"Again, the passengers were all hysterical about ice, and I pointed out
to Mr. Ismay the possibilities of seeing ice if I went to Halifax. Then
I knew it would be best to keep in touch with land stations as best I
could. We have experienced great difficulty in transmitting news, also
names of survivors. Our wireless is very poor, and again we have had
so many interruptions from other ships and also messages from shore
(principally press, which we ignored). I gave instructions to send first
all official messages, then names of passengers, then survivors' private
messages. We had haze early Tuesday morning for several hours;
again more or less all Wednesday from 5.30 A. M. to 5 P. M.; strong
south-southwesterly winds and clear weather Thursday, with moderate
rough sea.

"I am pleased to say that all survivors have been very plucky. The
majority of women, first, second and third class, lost their husbands,
and, considering all, have been wonderfully well. Tuesday our doctor
reported all survivors physically well. Our first class passengers have
behaved splendidly, given up their cabins voluntarily and supplied the
ladies with clothes, etc. We all turned out of our cabins and gave them
to survivors--saloon, smoking room, library, etc., also being used for
sleeping accommodation. Our crew, also turned out to let the crew of
the Titanic take their quarters. I am pleased to state that owing to
preparations made for the comfort of survivors, none were the worse for
exposure, etc. I beg to specially mention how willing and cheerful the
whole of the ship's company behaved, receiving the highest praise from
everybody. And I can assure you I am very proud to have such a company
under my command.
