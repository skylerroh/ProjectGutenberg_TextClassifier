future triumphs; and Sirona was gay, as she had usually been only when
playing with the children, so that even Miriam's wild cry, which the
youth explained to be the scream of an owl, only for a moment reminded
her of the danger in which she was placing herself.  Petrus' slaves had
long gone to rest before she began to weary of amusing herself with
Hermas, and desired him to lay aside her husband's equipment, and to
leave her.  Hermas obeyed while she warily opened the shutters, and
turning to him, said, "You cannot venture through the court-yard; you
must go through this window into the open street.  But there is some one
coming down the road; let him pass first, it will not be long to wait,
for he is walking quickly."

She carefully drew the shutters to, and laughed to see how clumsily
Hermas set to work to unbuckle the greaves; but the gay laugh died upon
her lips when the gate flew open, the greyhound and the senator's watch-
dogs barked loudly, and she recognized her husband's voice as he ordered
the dogs to be quiet.

"Fly-fly-for the gods' sake!"  she cried in a trembling voice.  With that
ready presence of mind with which destiny arms the weakest woman in great
and sudden danger, she extinguished the lamp, flung open the shutter, and
pushed Hermas to the window.  The boy did not stay to bid her farewell,
but swung himself with a strong leap down into the road, and, followed by
the barking of the dogs, which roused all the neighboring households, he
flew up the street to the little church.

He had not got more than half-way when he saw a man coming towards him;
he sprang into the shadow of a house, but the belated walker accelerated
his steps, and came straight up to him.  He set off running again, but
the other pursued him, and kept close at his heels till he had passed all
the houses and began to go up the mountain-path.  Hermas felt that he was
outstripping his pursuer, and was making ready for a spring over a block
of stone that encumbered the path, when he heard his name called behind
him, and he stood still, for he recognized the voice of the man from whom
he was flying as that of his good friend Paulus.

"You indeed" said the Alexandrian, panting for breath.  "Yes, you are
swifter than I.  Years hang lead on our heels, but do you know what it is
that lends them the swiftest wings?  You have just learned it!  It is a
bad conscience; and pretty things will be told about you; the dogs have
barked it all out loud enough to the night."

"And so they may!"  replied Hermas defiantly, and trying in vain to free
himself from the strong grasp of the anchorite who held him firmly.
"I have done nothing wrong."

"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife!"  interrupted Paulus in a tone
of stern severity.  "You have been with the centurion's pretty wife, and
were taken by surprise.  Where is your sheepskin?"

Hermas started, felt on his shoulder, and exclaimed, striking his fist
against his forehead, "Merciful Heaven!--I have left it there!  The
raging Gaul will find it."

"He did not actually see you there?"  asked Paulus eagerly.

"No, certainly not," groaned Hermas, "but the skin--"

"Well, well," muttered Paulus.  "Your sin is none the less, but something
may be done in that case.  Only think if it came to your father's ears;
it might cost him his life."

"And that poor Sirona!"  sighed Hermas.

"Leave me to settle that," exclaimed Paulus.  I will make everything
straight with her.  There, take sheepskin.  You will not?  Well, to be
sure, the man who does not fear to commit adultery would make nothing of
becoming his father's murderer.--There, that is the way!  fasten it
together over your shoulders; you will need it, for you must quit this
spot, and not for to-day and to-morrow only.  You wanted to go out into
the world, and now you will have the opportunity of showing whether you
really are capable of walking on your own feet.  First go to Raithu and
greet the pious Nikon in my name, and tell him that I remain here on the
mountain, for after long praying in the church I have found myself
unworthy of the office of elder which they offered me.  Then get yourself
carried by some ship's captain across the Red Sea, and wander up and down
the Egyptian coast.  The hordes of the Blemmyes have lately shown
themselves there; keep your eye on them, and when the wild bands are
plotting some fresh outbreak you can warn the watch on the mountain-
peaks; how to cross the sea and so outstrip them, it will be your
business to find out.  Do you feel bold enough and capable of
accomplishing this task?  Yes?  So I expected!  Now may the Lord guide
you.  I will take care of your father, and his blessing and your mother's
will rest upon you if you sincerely repent, and if you now do your duty."

"You shall learn that I am a man," cried Hermas with sparkling eyes.
"My bow and arrows are lying in your cave, I will fetch them and then--
aye!  you shall see whether you sent the right man on the errand.  Greet
my father, and once more give me your hand."

Paulus grasped the boy's right hand, drew him to him, and kissed his
forehead with fatherly tenderness.  Then he said, "In my cave, under the
green stone, you will find six gold-pieces; take three of them with you
on your journey.  You will probably need them at any rate to pay your
passage.  Now be off, and get to Raithu in good time."

Hermas hurried up the mountain, his head full of the important task
that had been laid upon him; dazzling visions of the great deeds he was
to accomplish eclipsed the image of the fair Sirona, and he was so
accustomed to believe in the superior insight and kindness of Paulus that
he feared no longer for Sirona now that his friend had made her affair
his own.

The Alexandrian looked after him, and breathed a short prayer for him;
then he went down again into the valley.

It was long past midnight, and the moon was sinking; it grew cooler and
cooler, and since he had given his sheepskin to Hermas he had nothing on,
but his thread-bare coat.  Nevertheless he went slowly onwards, stopping
every now and then, moving his arms, and speaking incoherent words in a
low tone to himself.

He thought of Hermas and Sirona, of his own youth, and of how in
Alexandria he himself had tapped at the shutters of the dark-haired Aso,
and the fair Simaitha.

"A child--a mere boy," he murmured.  "Who would have thought it?  The
Gaulish woman no doubt may be handsome, and as for him, it is a fact,
that as he threw the discus I was myself surprised at his noble figure.
And his eyes--aye, he has Magdalen's eyes!  If the Gaul had found him
with his wife, and had run his sword through his heart, he would have
gone unpunished by the earthly judge--however, his father is spared this
sorrow.  In this desert the old man thought that his darling could not be
touched by the world and its pleasures.  And now?  These brambles I once
thought lay dried up on the earth, and could never get up to the top of
the palm-tree where the dates ripen, but a bird flew by, and picked up
the berries, and carried them into its nest at the highest point of the
tree.

"Who can point out the road that another will take, and say to-day, 'To-
morrow I shall find him thus and not otherwise.'

"We fools flee into the desert in order to forget the world, and the
world pursues us and clings to our skirts.  Where are the shears that are
keen enough to cut the shadow from beneath our feet?  What is the prayer
that can effectually release us--born of the flesh--from the burden of
the flesh?  My Redeemer, Thou Only One, who knowest it, teach it to me,
the basest of the base."

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
