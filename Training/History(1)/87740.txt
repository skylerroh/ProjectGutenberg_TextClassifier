"All right; I obey you.  The whole thing is out of my way of business
awfully.  Bonjour."




CHAPTER IX.

Punctually at eight o'clock Graham Vane had taken his seat at a corner
table at the remote end of the cafe Jean Jacques, called for his cup of
coffee and his evening journal, and awaited the arrival of M. Lebeau.
His patience was not tasked long.  In a few minutes the Frenchman
entered, paused at the comptoir, as was his habit, to address a polite
salutation to the well-dressed lady who there presided, nodded as usual
to Armand Monnier, then glanced round, recognized Graham with a smile,
and approached his table with the quiet grace of movement by which he was
distinguished.

Seating himself opposite to Graham, and speaking in a voice too low to be
heard by others, and in French, he then said,

"In thinking over your communication this morning, it strikes me as
probable, perhaps as certain, that this Louise Duval or her children, if
she have any, must be entitled to some moneys bequeathed to her by a
relation or friend in England.  What say you to that assumption, Monsieur
Lamb?"

"You are a sharp fellow," answered Graham.  "Just what I say to myself.
Why else should I be instructed to go to such expense in finding her out?
Most likely, if one can't trace her, or her children born before the date
named, any such moneys will go to some one else; and that some one else,
whoever he be, has commissioned my employer to find out.  But I don't
imagine any sum due to her or her heirs can be much, or that the matter
is very important; for, if so, the thing would not be carelessly left in
the hands of one of the small fry like myself, and clapped in along with
a lot of other business as an off-hand job."

"Will you tell me who employed you?"

"No, I don't feel authorized to do that at present; and I don't see the
necessity of it.  It seems to me, on consideration, a matter for the
police to ferret out; only, as I asked before, how should I get at the
police?"

"That is not difficult.  It is just possible that I might help you better
than any lawyer or any detective."

"Why, did you ever know this Louise Duval?"

"Excuse me, Monsieur Lamb; you refuse me your full confidence; allow me
to imitate your reserve."

"Oho!" said Graham; "shut up as close as you like; it is nothing to me.
Only observe, there is this difference between us, that I am employed by
another.  He does not authorize me to name him, and if I did commit that
indiscretion, I might lose my bread and cheese.  Whereas you have
nobody's secret to guard but your own, in saying whether or not you ever
knew a Madame or Mademoiselle Duval; and if you have some reason for not
getting me the information I am instructed to obtain, that is also a
reason for not troubling you further.  And after all, old boy" (with a
familiar slap on Lebeau's stately shoulder), "after all, it is I who
would employ you; you don't employ me.  And if you find out the lady, it
is you who would get the L100., not I."

M. Lebeau mechanically brushed, with a light movement of hand, the
shoulder which the Englishman had so pleasantly touched, drew himself and
chair some inches back, and said slowly,--

"Monsieur Lamb, let us talk as gentleman to gentleman.  Put aside the
question of money altogether; I must first know why your employer wants
to hunt out this poor Louise Duval.  It may be to her injury, and I would
do her none if you offered thousands where you offer pounds.  I forestall
the condition of mutual confidence; I own that I have known her,--it is
many years ago; and, Monsieur Lamb, though a Frenchman very often injures
a woman from love, he is in a worse plight for bread and cheese than I am
if he injures her for money."

"Is he thinking of the duchess's jewels?" thought Graham.  "Bravo, mon
vieux," he said aloud; "but as I don't know what my employer's motive in
his commission is, perhaps you can enlighten me.  How could his inquiry
injure Louise Duval?"

"I cannot say; but you English have the power to divorce your wives.
Louise Duval may have married an Englishman, separated from him, and he
wants to know where he can find, in order to criminate and divorce her,
or it may be to insist on her return to him."

"Bosh! that is not likely."

"Perhaps, then, some English friend she may have known has left her a
bequest, which would of course lapse to some one else if she be not
living."

"By gad!" cried Graham, "I think you hit the right nail on the head:
_c'est cela_.  But what then?"

"Well, if I thought any substantial benefit to Louise Duval might result
from the success of your inquiry, I would really see if it were in my
power to help you.  But I must have time to consider."

"How long?"

"I can't exactly say; perhaps three or four days."

"Bon! I will wait.  Here comes M. Georges.  I leave you to dominos and
him.  Good-night."

Late that night M. Lebeau was seated alone in a chamber connected with
the cabinet in which he received visitors.  A ledger was open before him,
which he scanned with careful eyes, no longer screened by spectacles.
The survey seemed to satisfy him.  He murmured, "It suffices, the time
has come," closed the book, returned it to his bureau, which he locked
up, and then wrote in cipher the letter here reduced into English:--


     "DEAR AND NOBLE FRIEND,--Events march; the Empire is everywhere
     undermined.  Our treasury has thriven in my hands; the sums
     subscribed and received by me through you have become more than
     quadrupled by advantageous speculations, in which M. Georges has
     been a most trustworthy agent.  A portion of them I have continued
     to employ in the mode suggested,--namely, in bringing together men
     discreetly chosen as being in their various ways representatives and
     ringleaders of the motley varieties that, when united at the right
     moment, form a Parisian mob.  But from that right moment we are as
     yet distant.  Before we can call passion into action, we must
     prepare opinion for change.  I propose now to devote no
     inconsiderable portion of our fund towards the inauguration of a
     journal which shall gradually give voice to our designs.  Trust me
     to insure its success, and obtain the aid of writers who will have
     no notion of the uses to which they ultimately contribute.  Now that
     the time has come to establish for ourselves an organ in the press,
     addressing higher orders of intelligence than those which are needed
     to destroy and incapable of reconstructing, the time has also
     arrived for the reappearance in his proper name and rank of the man
     in whom you take so gracious an interest.  In vain you have pressed
     him to do so before; till now he had not amassed together, by the
     slow process of petty gains and constant savings, with such
     additions as prudent speculations on his own account might
     contribute, the modest means necessary to his resumed position; and
     as he always contended against your generous offers, no
     consideration should ever tempt him either to appropriate to his
     personal use a single sou intrusted to him for a public purpose, or
     to accept from friendship the pecuniary aid which would abase him
     into the hireling of a cause.  No!  Victor de Mauleon despises too
     much the tools that he employs to allow any man hereafter to say,
     'Thou also wert a tool, and hast been paid for thy uses.'

     "But to restore the victim of calumny to his rightful place in this
     gaudy world, stripped of youth and reduced in fortune, is a task
     that may well seem impossible.  To-morrow he takes the first step
     towards the achievement of the impossible.  Experience is no bad
     substitute for youth, and ambition is made stronger by the goad of
     poverty.

     "Thou shalt hear of his news soon."

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
