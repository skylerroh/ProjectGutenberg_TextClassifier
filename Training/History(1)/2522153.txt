[175] The house of Pomponius and the seat of the Academy was not on
the Esquiline, but on the Quirinal, on the area of the Baths of
Constantine, opposite the gate of the Colonna Gardens. The mistake
in the name of the hill must be attributed to Pomponius himself,
who had written on the door of the house:--POMPONI . LAETI .
ET . SOCIETATIS . ESCVVILINAI. After the reform of the statutes,
another sign, less classic in style, was put up:
SOCIETAS-LITERATORUM-S-VICTORIS-IN-ESQUILIIS.

[176] The Temple of Fortune in Rome was dedicated on this very day.
