Phanes stopped him before he could reach the door, and placing himself
proudly between the king and the trembling, thankful Psamtik, said: "You
would be going on a useless errand, noble Lydian.  In defiance of your
command, my Sovereign, but in virtue of the full powers you once gave me,
I have ordered the grandson of Amasis to be the executioner's first
victim.  You have just heard the sound of a horn; that was the sign that
the last heir to the Egyptian throne born on the shores of the Nile has
been gathered to his fathers.  I am aware of the fate I have to expect,
Cambyses.  I will not plead for a life whose end has been attained.
Croesus, I understand your reproachful looks.  You grieve for the
murdered children.  But life is such a web of wretchedness and
disappointment, that I agree with your philosopher Solon in thinking
those fortunate to whom, as in former days to Kleobis and Biton, the gods
decree an early death.

     [Croesus, after having shown Solon his treasures, asked him whom he
     held to be the most fortunate of men, hoping to hear his own name.
     The sage first named Tellus, a famous citizen of Athens, and then
     the brothers Kleobis and Biton.  These were two handsome youths, who
     had gained the prize for wrestling, and one day, when the draught-
     animals had not returned from the field, dragged their mother
     themselves to the distant temple, in presence of the people.  The
     men of Argos praised the strength of the sons,--the women praised
     the mother who possessed these sons.  She, transported with delight
     at her sons' deed and the people's praise, went to the statue of the
     goddess and besought her to give them the best that could fall to
     the lot of men.  When her prayer was over and the sacrifice offered,
     the youths fell asleep, and never woke again.  They were dead.

"If I have ever been dear to you, Cambyses--if my counsels have been of
any use, permit me as a last favor to say a few more words.  Psamtik
knows the causes that rendered us foes to each other.  Ye all, whose
esteem is worth so much to me, shall know them too.  This man's father
placed me in his son's stead at the head of the troops which had been
sent to Cyprus.  Where Psamtik had earned humiliation, I won success and
glory.  I also became unintentionally acquainted with a secret, which
seriously endangered his chances of obtaining the crown; and lastly, I
prevented his carrying off a virtuous maiden from the house of her
grandmother, an aged woman, beloved and respected by all the Greeks.
These are the sins which he has never been able to forgive; these are the
grounds which led him to carry on war to the death with me directly I had
quitted his father's service.  The struggle is decided now.  My innocent
children have been murdered at thy command, and I have been pursued like
a wild beast.  That has been thy revenge.  But mine!--I have deprived
thee of thy throne and reduced thy people to bondage.  Thy daughter I
have called my slave, thy son's death-warrant was pronounced by my lips,
and my eyes have seen the maiden whom thou persecutedst become the happy
wife of a brave man.  Undone, sinking ever lower and lower, thou hast
watched me rise to be the richest and most powerful of my nation.  In the
lowest depth of thine own misery--and this has been the most delicious
morsel of my vengeance--thou wast forced to see me--me, Phanes shedding
tears that could not be kept back, at the sight of thy misery.  The man,
who is allowed to draw even one breath of life, after beholding his enemy
so low, I hold to be happy as the gods themselves  I have spoken."

He ceased, and pressed his hand on his wound.  Cambyses gazed at him in
astonishment, stepped forward, and was just going to touch his girdle--
an action which would have been equivalent to the signing of a death-
warrant when his eye caught sight of the chain, which he himself had hung
round the Athenian's neck as a reward for the clever way in which he had
proved the innocence of Nitetis.

     [The same sign was used by the last Darius to denote that his able
     Greek general Memnon, who had offended him by his plainness of
     speech, was doomed to death.  As he was being led away, Memnon
     exclaimed, in allusion to Alexander, who was then fast drawing near:
     "Thy remorse will soon prove my worth; my avenger is not far off."
     Droysen, Alex. d. Grosse,  Diod. XVII. 30.  Curtius III. 2.]

The sudden recollection of the woman he loved, and of the countless
services rendered him by Phanes, calmed his wrath his hand dropped.  One
minute the severe ruler stood gazing lingeringly at his disobedient
friend; the next, moved by a sudden impulse, he raised his right hand
again, and pointed imperiously to the gate leading from the court.

Phanes bowed in silence, kissed the king's robe, and descended slowly
into the court.  Psamtik watched him, quivering with excitement, sprang
towards the veranda, but before his lips could utter the curse which his
heart had prepared, he sank powerless on to the ground.

Cambyses beckoned to his followers to make immediate preparations for a
lion-hunt in the Libyan mountains.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
