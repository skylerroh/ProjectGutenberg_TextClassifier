          And built Thee temples of eternal stone.
          For Thee my ships have brought across the sea
          The tribute of the nations.  This I did--
          When were such things done in the former time?

          For dark the fate of him who would rebel
          Against Thee: though Thy sway is just and mild.
          My father, Amon--as an earthly son
          His earthly father--so I call on Thee.
          Look down from heaven on me, beset by foes,
          By heathen foes--the folk that know Thee not.
          The nations have combined against Thy son;
          I stand alone--alone, and no man with me.
          My foot and horse are fled, I called aloud
          And no one heard--in vain I called to them.
          And yet I say: the sheltering care of Amon
          Is better succor than a million men,
          Or than ten thousand knights, or than a thousand
          Brothers and sons though gathered into one.
          And yet I say: the bulwarks raised by men
          However strong, compared to Thy great works
          Are but vain shadows, and no human aid
          Avails against the foe--but Thy strong hand.
          The counsel of Thy lips shall guide my way;
          I have obeyed whenever Thou hast ruled;
          I call on Thee--and, with my fame, Thy glory
          Shall fill the world, from farthest east to west."

          Yea, his cry rang forth even far as Hermonthis,
          And Amon himself appeared at his call; and gave him
          His hand and shouted in triumph, saying to the Pharaoh:
          "Help is at hand, O Rameses.  I will uphold thee--
          I thy father am he who now is thy succor,
          Bearing thee in my hands.  For stronger and readier
          I than a hundred thousand mortal retainers;
          I am the Lord of victory loving valor?
          I rejoice in the brave and give them good counsel,
          And he whom I counsel certainly shall not miscarry."

          Then like Menth, with his right he scattered the arrows,
          And with his left he swung his deadly weapon,
          Felling the foe--as his foes are felled by Baal.
          The chariots were broken and the drivers scattered,
          Then was the foe overthrown before his horses.
          None found a hand to fight: they could not shoot
          Nor dared they hurl the spear but fled at his coming
          Headlong into the river."

A silence as of the grave reigned in the vast hall, Rameses fixed his
eyes on the poet, as though he would engrave his features on his very
soul, and compare them with those of another which had dwelt there
unforgotten since the day of Kadesh.  Beyond a doubt his preserver stood
before him.

Seized by a sudden impulse, he interrupted the poet in the midst of his
stirring song, and cried out to the assembled guests:

"Pay honor to this man! for the Divinity chose to appear under his form
to save your king when he 'alone, and no man with him,' struggled with a
thousand."

"Hail to Pentaur!"  rang through the hall from the vast assembly, and
Nefert rose and gave the poet the bunch of flowers she had been wearing
on her bosom.

The king nodded approval, and looked enquiringly at his daughter; Bent-
Anat's eyes met his with a glance of intelligence, and with all the
simplicity of an impulsive child, she took from her head the wreath that
had decorated her beautiful hair, went up to Pentaur, and crowned him
with it, as it was customary for a bride to crown her lover before the
wedding.

Rameses observed his daughter's action with some surprise, and the guests
responded to it with loud cheering.

The king looked gravely at Bent-Anat and the young priest; the eyes of
all the company were eagerly fixed on the princess and the poet.  The
king seemed to have forgotten the presence of strangers, and to be wholly
absorbed in thought, but by degrees a change came over his face, it
cleared, as a landscape is cleared from the morning mists under the
influence of the spring sunshine.  When he looked up again his glance was
bright and satisfied, and Bent-Anat knew what it promised when it
lingered lovingly first on her, and then on her friend, whose head was
still graced by the wreath that had crowned hers.

At last Rameses turned from the lovers, and said to the guests:

"It is past midnight, and I will now leave you.  To-morrow evening I bid
you all--and you especially, Pentaur--to be my guests in this banqueting
hall.  Once more fill your cups, and let us empty them--to a long time of
peace after the victory which, by the help of the Gods, we have won.  And
at the same time let us express our thanks to my friend Ani, who has
entertained us so magnificently, and who has so faithfully and zealously
administered the affairs of the kingdom during my absence."

The company pledged the king, who warmly shook hands with the Regent, and
then, escorted by his wandbearers and lords in waiting, quitted the hall,
after he had signed to Mena, Ameni, and the ladies to follow him.

Nefert greeted her husband, but she immediately parted from the royal
party, as she had yielded to the urgent entreaty of Katuti that she
should for this night go to her mother, to whom she had so much to tell,
instead of remaining with the princess.  Her mother's chariot soon took
her to her tent.

Rameses dismissed his attendants in the ante-room of his apartments; when
they were alone he turned to Bent-Anat and said affectionately.

"What was in your mind when you laid your wreath on the poet's brow?"

"What is in every maiden's mind when she does the like," replied Bent-
Anat with trustful frankness.

"And your father?"  asked the king.

"My father knows that I will obey him even if he demands of me the
hardest thing--the sacrifice of all my--happiness; but I believe that he
--that you love me fondly, and I do not forget the hour in which you said
to me that now my mother was dead you would be father and mother both to
me, and you would try to understand me as she certainly would have
understood me.  But what need between us of so many words.  I love
Pentaur--with a love that is not of yesterday--with the first perfect
love of my heart and he has proved himself worthy of that high honor.
But were he ever so humble, the hand of your daughter has the power to
raise him above every prince in the land."

"It has such power, and you shall exercise it," cried the king.  "You
have been true and faithful to yourself, while your father and protector
left you to yourself.  In you I love the image of your mother, and I
learned from her that a true woman's heart can find the right path better
than a man's wisdom.  Now go to rest, and to-morrow morning put on a
fresh wreath, for you will have need of it, my noble daughter."

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:

Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
