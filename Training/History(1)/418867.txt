        Foot, a sandal of amber.                                      10

      Come, for jolly the time, awake.
        Chant in melody musical
        Hymns of bridal; on earth a foot
      Beating, hands to the winds above
        Torches oozily swinging.                                      15

    Such, as she that on Idaly
        Venus dwelleth, appear'd before
        Him, the Phrygian arbiter,
      So with Mallius happily
        Happy Junia weddeth.                                          20

      Like some myrtle of Asia
        Bright in airily blossoming
        Boughs, the wood Hamadryades
      Nurse with showery dew, to be
        Theirs, a tender plaything.                                   25

      So come to us in haste; away,
        Leave thy Thespian hollow-arch'd
        Rock, muse-haunted, Aonian,
      Drench'd in spray from aloft, the cold
        Drift of Nymph Aganippe.                                      30

      Homeward summon a sovereign
        Wife most passionate, holden in
        Love fast prisoner: ivy not
      Closer closes an elm around,
        Interchangeably trailing.                                     35

      You too with him, O you for whom
        Comes as joyous a time, your own.
        Virgins stainless of heart, arise.
      Chant in unison, Hymen, O
        Hymen, O Hymenaeus.                                           40

      That, more readily listening,
        Whiles your song to familiar
        Duty calls him, he hie apace,
      Lord of fair paramours, of youth's
        Fair affection uniter.                                        45


      Who more worthy than he to list
        Lovers wearily languishing?
        Bends from heaven a sovereign
      God adorabler? Hymen, O
        Hymen, O Hymenaeus.                                           50

      You the father in years for his
        Child beseecheth; a virginal
        Zone falls slackly to earth for you,
      You half-fear in his hankering
        Lists the groomsman approaching.                              55

      You from motherly lap the bright
        Girl can sever; your hand divine
        Gives dominion, ushering
      Warm the lover. O Hymen, O
        Hymen, O Hymenaeus.                                           60

      Nought delightful, if you be far,
        Nought unharmed of envious
        Tongues, Love wins him: if you be near
      Much he wins him. O excellent
        God, that hath not a rival.                                   65

      Houses cannot, if you be far,
        Yield their children, a babe renew
        Sire or mother: if you be near,
      Comes renewal. O excellent
        God, that hath not a rival.                                   70

      If your great ceremonial
        Fail, no champion yeomanry
        Guards the border. If you be near
      Arms the border. O excellent
        God, that hath not a rival.                                   75


    Fling the portal apart. The bride
        Waits. O see ye the luminous
        Torch-flakes ruddily flickering?

        Eyes do weep to be going.                                     85

      Weep not, lady; for envious
        Tongue no lovelier owneth, Au-
        Runculeia; nor any more
      Fair saw rosily bright the dawn                               (85)
        Leave his chamber in Ocean.                                   90

      Such in many a flowering
        Garden, trimm'd for a lord's delight,
        Stands some delicate hyacinth.
      Yet you tarry. The day declines.                              (90)
        Forth, fair bride, to the people.                             95

      Forth, fair bride, to the people, if
        So it likes you, a-listening
        Words that please us. O eye ye yon
      Torches ruddily flickering?                                   (95)
        Forth, fair bride, to the people.                            100

      Husband never of yours shall haunt
        Stained wanton, a mutinous
        Fancy shamefully following,
      Tire not ever, or e'er from your                             (100)
        Dainty bosom unyoke him.                                     105

      He more lithe than a vine amid
        Trees, that, mazily folded, it
        Clasps and closes, in amorous
      Arms shall close thee. The day declines.                     (105)
        Forth, fair bride, to the people.                            110

      Couch of pleasure, _O odorous
        Couch, whose gorgeous apparellings,
        Silver-purple, on Indian
      Woods do rest them; adown_ the bright
        Feet in ivory glisten;                                       115

      When thy lord in his hour attains,
        What large extasy, while the night                         (110)
        Fleets, or noon the meridian
      Passes thoro'. The day declines.
        Forth, fair bride, to the people.                            120


    Lift the torches aloft in air,
        Boys: the fiery veil is here.                              (115)
        Come, to measure your hymn rehearse.
      Hymen, O Hymenaeus, O
        Hymen, O Hymenaeus.                                          125

      Nor withhold ye the countryman's
        Ribald raillery Fescenine.                                 (120)
        Nor if happily boys declare
      Thy dominion attaint, refuse,
        Youth, the nuts to be flinging.                              130

      Fling, O womanish youth; the boys
        Ask thee charity. Time agone                               (125)
        Toys and folly; to-day begins
      Our high duty, Talassius.
        Hasten, youth, to be flinging.                               135

      Thou didst surely but yestereve
        Mock the women, a favourite                                (130)
        Far above them: anon the first
      Beard, the razor. Alack, alas!
        Hasten, youth, to be flinging.                               140

      You, whom odorous oils declare
        Bridegroom, swerve not; a slippery                         (135)
        Love calls lightly, but yet refrain.
      Hymen, O Hymenaeus, O
        Hymen, O Hymenaeus.                                          145

      Lawful only did e'er delight
        You, we know; but it is not, O                             (140)
        Husband, lawful as heretofore.
      Hymen, O Hymenaeus, O
        Hymen, O Hymenaeus.                                          150

      Bride, thou also, if he demand
        Aught, refuse not, assent, obey.                           (145)
        Love can angrily pipe adieu.
      Hymen, O Hymenaeus, O
        Hymen, O Hymenaeus.                                          155

      Look! thy mansion, a sovereign
        Home most goodly, by him to thee                           (150)
        Given. Reign as a queen within,
      Hymen, O Hymenaeus, O
        Hymen, O Hymenaeus.                                          160

      Still when hoary decrepitude,
        Shaking wintery brows benign,                              (155)
        Nods a tremulous Yes to all.
      Hymen, O Hymenaeus, O

      With fair augury smite the blest
        Threshold, sunnily glistening                              (160)
        Feet: yon ivory door approach,
      Hymen, O Hymenaeus, O

      See one seated, a banqueter.
        'Tis thy lord on a Tyrian                                  (165)
        Couch: his spirit is all to thee.

        Thee love lighteth a bosoming                              (170)
        Flame; but deeper, a fire within.
      Hymen, O Hymenaeus, O

        Arm, props happily, boy, depart.                           (175)

      You in chastity tried the long
        Years, good women of agedest                               (180)
        Husbands, lay ye the bride to-night.

    Husband, stay not: a bride within
        Coucheth ready, the flowering                              (185)
        Spring less lovely; a countenance
      White as parthenice, beyond
        Yellow poppy to gaze on.                                     200

      Thou, so help me the favouring
        Gods immortal, as heavenly                                 (190)
        Fair art also, adorned of
      Venus' bounty. The day declines.
        Come nor tarry to greet her.                                 205

      Not too slothfully tarrying,
        Thou art here. Benediction of                              (195)
        Venus help thee, a man without
      Shame of blameless, a love that is
        Honest frankly revealing.                                    210

      Dust of infinite Africa,

      Virgins, close ye the door. Enough
        This our carol. O happiest                                 (225)
        Lovers, jollity live with you.
      Still that genial youth to love's

LXII.

YOUTHS.

    Hesper is here; rise youths, rise all of you; high on Olympus
      Hesper his orb long-look'd for aloft 'gins slowly to kindle.
      Time is now to arise, from tables costly to part us;
      Now doth a virgin approach, now soundeth a glad Hymenaeal.

    Hymen O Hymenaeus, O Hymen come Hymenaeus.                         5

VIRGINS.

    See ye yon youthful band? O, maidens, rise ye to meet them.
      Comes not Night's bright bearer a fire o'er Oeta revealing?
      Surely; for even now, in a moment all have arisen,
      Not for nought have arisen; a song waits, goodly to gaze on.

    Hymen O Hymenaeus, O Hymen come Hymenaeus.                        10

YOUTHS.

    No light victory this, O comrades, ready before us.
      Busy the virgins muse, their practis'd ditty recalling,
      Muse nor shall miscarry; a song for memory waits us.
      Rightly; for all their souls do inwards labour in issue.

    We--our thoughts one way, our ears have drifted another,          15
      So comes worthy defeat; no victory calls to the careless.
      Come then, in even race let thought their melody rival;
      They must open anon; 'twere better anon be replying.

    Hymen O Hymenaeus, O Hymen come Hymenaeus.

VIRGINS.

    Hesper, moveth in heaven a light more tyrannous ever?             20
      Thou from a mother's arms canst wrest her daughter asunder,
      Wrest from a mother's arms her daughter woefully clinging,
      Then to the burning youth his virgin beauty deliver.
      Foes in a new-sack'd town, when wrought they crueller ever?

    Hymen O Hymenaeus, O Hymen come Hymenaeus.                        25

YOUTHS.

    Hesper, shineth in heaven a light more genial ever?
      Thou with a bridal flame true lovers' unity crownest,
      All which duly the men, which plighted duly the parents,
      Then completed alone, when thou in splendour awakest.
      When shone an happier hour than thy god-speeded arriving?       30

    Hymen O Hymenaeus, O Hymen come Hymenaeus.

VIRGINS.

    Sisters, Hesper a fellow of our bright company taketh.

      Hesper, awaiting thee each sentinel holdeth alarum.
      Night veils love's false thieves; thieves still when, Hesper, another
      Name, but unalter'd still, thou tak'st them surely, returning. (35)
      Yet be the maidens pleas'd in woeful fancy to chide thee.       45
      Maybe for all they chide, their hearts do inly desire thee.

    Hymen O Hymenaeus, O Hymen come Hymenaeus.

VIRGINS.

    Look in a garden-croft when a flower privily growing,
      Hid from grazing kine, by ploughshare never y-broken,          (40)
      Strok'd by the breeze, by the sun nurs'd sturdily, rear'd by
          the showers;                                                50
      Many a wistful boy, and maidens many desire it:

    Yet if a slender nail hath nipt his bloom to deflour it,
      Never a wistful boy, nor maidens any desire it:

    Such is a girl untoy'd with as yet, yet lovely to kinsmen;      (45)
      Once her body profan'd, herflow'r of chastity blighted,         55
      Boys no more she delights, nor seems so lovely to maidens;

    Hymen O Hymenaeus, O Hymen come Hymenaeus.

YOUTHS.

    Look as a lone lorn vine in a bare field sorrily growing,
      Never an arm uplifts, no grape to maturity ripens,            (50)

    Only with headlong weight her tender body declining,              60
      Bows, till topmost spray and roots meet feebly together;
      Her no peasant swain, nor bullock tendeth her ever;

    Yet to the bachelor elm if marriage-fortune unite her,
      Many a peasant tills and bullocks many about her;             (55)

    Such is a maid untoy'd with as yet, in loneliness aging;          65
      Wins she a bridegroom meet, in time's warm fulness arriving,
      So to the man more dear, and less unlovely to parents.

    O then, clasp thy love, nor fight, fair maiden, against him.
      Sin 'twere surely to fight; thy father gave to his arms thee, (60)
      Father's self and mother; obey nor wrongly defy them.           70

    Virgin's crown thou claim'st not alone, but partly the parents,
      Father's one whole part, one goes to the mother allotted,
      Rests one only to thee; O fight not with them alone thou,
      Both to a son their rights and both their dowry deliver.   75 (65)

    Hymen O Hymenaeus, O Hymen come Hymenaeus.


LXIII.

    In a swift ship Attis hasting over ocean a mariner
      When he gained the wood, the Phrygian, with a foot of agility,
      When he near'd the leafy forest, dark sanctuary divine;
      By unearthly fury frenzied, a bewildered agony,
      With a flint of edge he shatter'd to the ground his humanity.    5
      Then aghast to see the lost limbs, the deform'd inutility,
      While still the gory dabble did anew the soil pollute,
      With a snowy palm the woman took affrayed a taborine.
      Taborine, the trump that hails thee, Cybele, thy initiant.
      Then a dainty finger heaving to the tremulous hide o' the bull,  10
      He began this invocation to the company, spirit-awed.

      "To the groves, ye sexless eunuchs, in assembly to Cybele,
      Lost sheep that err rebellious to the lady Dindymene;
      Ye, who all awing for exile in a country of aliens,
      My unearthly rule obeying to be with me, my retinue,            15
      Could aby the surly salt seas' mid inexorability,
      Could in utter hate to lewdness your sex dishabilitate;

    Let a gong clash glad emotion, set a giddy fury to roam,
    All slow delay be banish'd, thither his ye thither away
    To the Phrygian home, the wild wood, to the sanctuary divine;     20

      Where rings the noisy cymbal, taborines are in echoing,
      On a curved oat the Phrygian deep pipeth a melody,
      With a fury toss the Maenads clad in ivies a frolic head,
      To a barbarous ululation the religious orgy wakes,
      Where fleets across the silence Cybele's holy family;           25
      Thither his we, so beseems us; to a mazy measure away."

    Thus as Attis, a woman, Attis, not a woman, urg'd the rest,
      On a sudden yell'd in huddling agitation every tongue,
      Taborines give airy murmur, give a clangorous echo gongs,
      With a rush the brotherhood hastens to the woods, the bosom of Ide. 30
      Then in agony, breathless, errant, flush'd wearily, cometh on
