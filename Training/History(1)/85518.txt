though some great burden were lifted from his soul.  Then he went on in a
commanding tone--and his voice rang so fiercely that the color which had
mounted to his cheeks could hardly be due to satisfaction at this last
good news....

"As it is not yet two hours after noon, send all your men out to search
for him and deliver him up.  My father will give you a warrant, and the
Arabs on the other shore will assist you.  Perhaps the thief may fall
into our hands even sooner and with him the emerald, unless the rogue has
succeeded in hiding it or selling it."  Then his voice sank, and he added
in a tone of regret.  It is a pity as concerns the man, we had not one in
our stables who knew more about horses!  Fresh proof of your maxim,
mother: if you want to be well served you must buy rascals!"

"Strictly speaking," said Neforis meditatively, "Hiram is not one of our
people.  He was a freedman of Thomas' and came here with his daughter.
Every one speaks highly of his skill in the stable; but for this robbery
we might have kept him for the rest of his life still, if the girl had
ever taken it into her head to leave us and to take him with her, we
could not have detained him.--You may say what you will, and abuse me and
mock me; I have none of what you call imagination; I see things simply as
they are: but there must be some understanding between that girl and the
thief."

"You are not to say another word of such monstrous nonsense!"  exclaimed
her husband; and he would have said more, but that at that moment the
groom of the chambers announced that Gamaliel, the Jewish goldsmith,
begged an audience.  The man had come to give information with regard to
the fate of the lost emerald.

At this statement Orion changed color, and he turned away from the
merchant as the slave admitted the same Israelite who had been sitting
over the fire with the head-servants.  He at once plunged into his story,
telling it in his peculiar light-hearted style.  He was so rich that the
loss he might suffer did not trouble him enough to spoil his good-humor,
and so honest that it was a pleasure to him to restore the stolen
property to its rightful owner.  Early that morning, so he told them,
Hiram the groom had been to him to offer him a wonderfully large and
splendid emerald for sale.  The freedman had assured him that the stone
was part of the property left by the famous Thomas, his former master.
It had decorated the head-stall of the horse which the hero of Damascus
had last ridden, and it had come to him with the steed.

"I offered him what I thought fair," the Jew went on, "and paid him two
thousand drachmae on account; the remainder he begged me to take charge
of for the present.  To this I agreed, but ere long a fly began to hum
suspicion in my ear.  Then the police rushed through the town with the
bloodhounds.  Good Heavens, what a barking!  The creatures yelped as if
they would bark my poor house down, like the trumpets round the walls of
Jericho--you know.  'What is the matter now,' I asked of the dog-keepers,
and behold!  my suspicions about the emerald were justified; so here, my
lord Governor, I have brought you the stone, and as every suckling in
Memphis hears from its nurse--unless it is deaf--what a just man Mukaukas
George is, you will no doubt make good to me what I advanced to that
stammering scoundrel.  And you will have the best of the bargain, noble
Sir; for I make no demand for interest or even maintenance for the two
hours during which it was mine."

"Give me the stone !"  interrupted the Arab, who was annoyed by the Jew's
jesting tone; he snatched the emerald from him, weighed it in his hand,
put it close to his eyes, held it far off, tapped it with a small hammer
that he took out of his breast-pocket, slipped it into its place in the
work, examining it keenly, suspiciously, and at last with satisfaction.
During all this, Orion had more than once turned pale, and the sweat
broke out on his handsome, pale face.  Had a miracle been wrought here?
How could this gem, which was surely on its way to Alexandria, have found
its way into the Jew's hands?  Or could Chusar have opened the little
packet and have sold the emerald to Hiram, and through him to the
jeweller?  He must get to the bottom of it, and while the Arab was
examining the gem he went up to Gamaliel and asked him: "Are you
positively certain--it is a matter of freedom or the dungeon--certain
that you had this stone from Hiram the Syrian and from no one else?
I mean, is the man so well-known to you that no mistake is possible?"

"God preserve us!"  exclaimed the Jew drawing back a step from Orion,
who was gazing at him with a sinister light in his eyes.  "How can my
lord doubt it?  Your respected father has known me these thirty years,
and do you suppose that I--I do not know the Syrian?  Why, who in Memphis
can stammer to compare with him?  And has he not killed half my children
with your wild young horses?--Half killed every one of my children I mean
--half killed them, I say, with fright.  They are all still alive and
well, God preserve them, but none the better for your horsebreaker; for
fresh air is good for children and my little Rebecca would stop indoors
till he was at home again for fear of his terrifying pranks."

"Well, well!"  Orion broke in.  "And at what hour did he bring you the
emerald for sale?  Exactly.  Now, recollect: when was it?  You surely
must remember."

"Adonai!  How should I?"  said the Jew.  "But wait, Sir, perhaps I may be
able to tell you.  In this hot weather we are up before sunrise; then we
said our prayers and had our morning broth; then.  .  .  ."

"Senseless chatter!"  urged Orion.  But Gamaliel went on without allowing
himself to be checked.  "Then little Ruth jumped into my lap to pull out
the white hairs that will grow under my nose and, just as the child was
doing it and I cried out:  'Oh, you hurt me!' the sun fell upon the earth
bank on which I was sitting."

"And at what time does it reach the bank?"  cried the young man.

"Exactly two hours after sunrise," replied the Jew, "at this time of
year.  Do me the honor of a visit tomorrow morning; you will not regret
it, for I can show you some beautiful, exquisite things--and you can
watch the shadow yourself."

"Two hours after sunrise," murmured Orion to himself, and then with fresh
qualms he reflected that it was fully four hours later when he had given
the packet to Chusar.  It was impossible to doubt the Jew's statement.
The man was rich, honest and content: he did not lie.  The jewel Orion
had sent away and that purchased from Hiram could not in any case be
identical.  But how could all this be explained?  It was enough to turn
his brain.  And not to dare to speak when mere silence was falsehood--
falsehood to his father and mother!--If only the hapless stammerer might
escape!  If he were caught;  then--then  merciful Heaven!  But no; it was
not to be thought of.--On, then, on; and if it came to the worst the
honor of a hundred stablemen could not outweigh that of one Orion;
horrible as it was, the man must be sacrificed.  He would see that his
life was spared and that he was soon set at liberty!

The Arab meanwhile had concluded his examination; still he was not
perfectly satisfied.  Orion longed to interpose; for if the merchant
expressed no doubts and acknowledged the recovered gem to be the stolen
one, much would be gained; so he turned to him again and said: "May I ask
you to show me the emerald once more?  It is quite impossible, do you
think, that a second should be found to match it?"

"That is too much to assert,"  said  the  Arab gravely.  "This stone
resembles that on the hanging to a hair; and yet it has a little
inequality which I do not remember noticing on it.  It is true I had
never seen it out of the setting, and this little boss may have been
turned towards the stuff, and yet, and yet.--Tell me, goldsmith, did the
thief give you the emerald bare--unset?"

"As bare as Adam and Eve before they ate the apple," said the Jew.

"That is a pity--a great pity!--And still I fancy that the stone in
the work was a trifle longer.  In such a case it is almost folly and
perversity to doubt, and yet I feel--and yet I ask myself: Is this really
the stone that formed that bud?"

"But Heaven bless us!"  cried Orion, "the twin of such an unique gem
would surely not drop from the skies and at the same moment into one and
the same house.  Let us be glad that the lost sheep has come back to us.
Now, I will lock it into this iron casket, Father, and as soon as the
robber is caught you send for me: do you understand, Psamtik?"  He nodded
to his parents, offered his hand to the Arab, and that in a way which
could not fail to satisfy any one, so that even the old man was won over;
and then he left the room.

The merchant's honor was saved; still his conscientious soul was
disturbed by a doubt that he could not away with.  He was about to take
leave but the Mukaukas was so buried in pillows, and kept his eyes so
closely shut, that no one could detect whether he were sleeping or
waking; so the Arab, not wishing to disturb him, withdrew without
speaking.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
