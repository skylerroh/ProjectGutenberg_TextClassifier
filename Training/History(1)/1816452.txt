  Then, him though dead, Hector again bespake.                  1050
    Patroclus! these prophetic strains of death
  At hand, and fate, why hast thou sung to me?
  May not the son of Thetis azure-hair'd,
  Achilles, perish first by spear of mine?
    He said; then pressing with his heel the trunk              1055
  Supine, and backward thursting it, he drew
  His glittering weapon from the wound, nor stay'd,
  But lance in hand, the godlike charioteer
  Pursued of swift AEacides, on fire
  To smite Automedon; but him the steeds                        1060
  Immortal, rapid, by the Gods conferr'd
  (A glorious gift) on Peleus, snatch'd away.

                  ARGUMENT OF THE SEVENTEENTH BOOK.


Sharp contest ensues around the body of Patroclus. Hector puts on the
armor of Achilles. Menelaus, having dispatched Antilochus to Achilles
with news of the death of Patroclus, returns to the battle, and,
together with Meriones, bears Patroclus off the field, while the
Ajaces cover their retreat.

  Nor Menelaus, Atreus' valiant son,
  Knew not how Menoetiades had fallen
  By Trojan hands in battle; forth he rush'd
  All bright in burnish'd armor through his van,
  And as some heifer with maternal fears                           5
  Now first acquainted, compasses around
  Her young one murmuring, with tender moan,
  So moved the hero of the amber locks
  Around Patroclus, before whom his spear
  Advancing and broad shield, he death denounced                  10
  On all opposers; neither stood the son
  Spear-famed of Panthus inattentive long
  To slain Patroclus, but approach'd the dead,
  And warlike Menelaus thus bespake.
    Prince! Menelaus! Atreus' mighty son!                         15
  Yield. Leave the body and these gory spoils;
  For of the Trojans or allies of Troy
  None sooner made Patroclus bleed than I.
  Seek not to rob me, therefore, of my praise
  Among the Trojans, lest my spear assail                         20
  Thee also, and thou perish premature.[1]
    To whom, indignant, Atreus' son replied.
  Self-praise, the Gods do know, is little worth.
  But neither lion may in pride compare
  Nor panther, nor the savage boar whose heart's                  25
  High temper flashes in his eyes, with these
  The spear accomplish'd youths of Panthus' house.
  Yet Hyperenor of equestrian fame
  Lived not his lusty manhood to enjoy,
  Who scoffingly defied my force in arms,                         30
  And call'd me most contemptible in fight
  Of all the Danai. But him, I ween,
  His feet bore never hence to cheer at home
  His wife and parents with his glad return.
  So also shall thy courage fierce be tamed,                      35
  If thou oppose me. I command thee, go--
  Mix with the multitude; withstand not me,
  Lest evil overtake thee! To be taught
  By sufferings only, is the part of fools.
    He said, but him sway'd not, who thus replied.                40
  Now, even now, Atrides! thou shalt rue
  My brother's blood which thou hast shed, and mak'st
  His death thy boast. Thou hast his blooming bride
  Widow'd, and thou hast fill'd his parents' hearts
  With anguish of unutterable wo;                                 45
  But bearing hence thy armor and thy head
  To Troy, and casting them at Panthus' feet,
  And at the feet of Phrontis, his espoused,
  I shall console the miserable pair.
  Nor will I leave that service unessay'd                         50
  Longer, nor will I fail through want of force,
  Of courage, or of terrible address.
    He ceased, and smote his shield, nor pierced the disk,
  But bent his point against the stubborn brass.
  Then Menelaus, prayer preferring first                          55
  To Jove,[2] assail'd Euphorbus in his turn,
  Whom pacing backward in the throat he struck,
  And both hands and his full force the spear
  Impelled, urged it through his neck behind.
  Sounding he fell; loud rang his batter'd arms.                  60
  His locks, which even the Graces might have own'd,
  Blood-sullied, and his ringlets wound about
  With twine of gold and silver, swept the dust.
  As the luxuriant olive by a swain
  Rear'd in some solitude where rills abound,                     65
  Puts forth her buds, and fann'd by genial airs
  On all sides, hangs her boughs with whitest flowers,
  But by a sudden whirlwind from its trench
  Uptorn, it lies extended on the field;
  Such, Panthus' warlike son Euphorbus seem'd,                    70
  By Menelaus, son of Atreus, slain
  Suddenly, and of all his arms despoil'd.
  But as the lion on the mountains bred,
  Glorious in strength, when he hath seized the best
  And fairest of the herd, with savage fangs                      75
  First breaks her neck, then laps the bloody paunch
  Torn wide; meantime, around him, but remote,
  Dogs stand and swains clamoring, yet by fear
  Repress'd, annoy him not nor dare approach;
  So there all wanted courage to oppose                           80
  The force of Menelaus, glorious Chief.
  Then, easily had Menelaus borne
  The armor of the son of Panthus thence,
  But that Apollo the illustrious prize
  Denied him, who in semblance of the Chief                       85
  Of the Ciconians, Mentes, prompted forth
  Against him Hector terrible as Mars,
  Whose spirit thus in accents wing'd he roused.
    Hector! the chase is vain; here thou pursuest
  The horses of AEacides the brave,                                90
  Which thou shalt never win, for they are steeds
  Of fiery nature, such as ill endure
  To draw or carry mortal man, himself
  Except, whom an immortal mother bore.
  Meantime, bold Menelaus, in defence                             95
  Of dead Patroclus, hath a Trojan slain
  Of highest note, Euphorbus, Panthus' son,
  And hath his might in arms for ever quell'd.
    So spake the God and to the fight return'd.
  But grief intolerable at that word                             100
  Seized Hector; darting through the ranks his eye,
  He knew at once who stripp'd Euphorbus' arms,
  And him knew also lying on the field,
  And from his wide wound bleeding copious still.
  Then dazzling bright in arms, through all the van              105
  He flew, shrill-shouting, fierce as Vulcan's fire
  Unquenchable; nor were his shouts unheard
  By Atreus' son, who with his noble mind
  Conferring sad, thus to himself began.
    Alas! if I forsake these gorgeous spoils,                    110
  And leave Patroclus for my glory slain,
  I fear lest the Achaians at that sight
  Incensed, reproach me; and if, urged by shame,
  I fight with Hector and his host, alone,
  Lest, hemm'd around by multitudes, I fall;                     115
  For Hector, by his whole embattled force
  Attended, comes. But whither tend my thoughts?
  No man may combat with another fenced
  By power divine and whom the Gods exalt,
  But he must draw down wo on his own head.                      120
  Me, therefore, none of all Achaia's host
  Will blame indignant, seeing my retreat
  From Hector, whom themselves the Gods assist.
  But might the battle-shout of Ajax once
  Reach me, with force united we would strive,                   125
  Even in opposition to a God,
  To rescue for Achilles' sake, his friend.
  Task arduous! but less arduous than this.
    While he thus meditated, swift advanced
  The Trojan ranks, with Hector at their head.                   130
  He then, retiring slow, and turning oft,
  Forsook the body. As by dogs and swains
  With clamors loud and spears driven from the stalls
  A bearded lion goes, his noble heart
  Abhors retreat, and slow he quits the prey;                    135
  So Menelaus with slow steps forsook
  Patroclus, and arrived in front, at length,
  Of his own phalanx, stood, with sharpen'd eyes
  Seeking vast Ajax, son of Telamon.
  Him leftward, soon, of all the field he mark'd                 140
  Encouraging aloud his band, whose hearts
  With terrors irresistible himself
  Phoebus had fill'd. He ran, and at his side
  Standing, incontinent him thus bespake.
    My gallant Ajax, haste--come quickly--strive                 145
  With me to rescue for Achilles' sake
  His friend, though bare, for Hector hath his arms.
    He said, and by his words the noble mind
  Of Ajax roused; issuing through the van
  He went, and Menelaus at his side.                             150
  Hector the body of Patroclus dragg'd,
  Stript of his arms, with falchion keen erelong
  Purposing to strike off his head, and cast
  His trunk, drawn distant, to the dogs of Troy.
  But Ajax, with broad shield tower-like, approach'd.            155
  Then Hector, to his bands retreating, sprang
  Into his chariot, and to others gave
  The splendid arms in charge, who into Troy
  Should bear the destined trophy of his praise,
  But Ajax with his broad shield guarding stood                  160
  Slain Menoetiades, as for his whelps
  The lion stands; him through some forest drear
  Leading his little ones, the hunters meet;
  Fire glimmers in his looks, and down he draws
  His whole brow into frowns, covering his eyes;                 165
  So, guarding slain Patroclus, Ajax lour'd.
  On the other side, with tender grief oppress'd
  Unspeakable, brave Menelaus stood.
  But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian band,
  Son of Hippolochus, in bitter terms                            170
  Indignant, reprimanded Hector thus,
    Ah, Hector, Chieftain of excelling form,
  But all unfurnish'd with a warrior's heart!
  Unwarranted I deem thy great renown
  Who art to flight addicted. Think, henceforth,                 175
  How ye shall save city and citadel
  Thou and thy people born in Troy, alone.
  No Lycian shall, at least, in your defence
  Fight with the Grecians, for our ceaseless toil
  In arms, hath ever been a thankless task.                      180
  Inglorious Chief! how wilt thou save a worse
  From warring crowds, who hast Sarpedon left
  Thy guest, thy friend, to be a spoil, a prey
  To yonder Argives? While he lived he much
  Thee and thy city profited, whom dead                          185
  Thou fear'st to rescue even from the dogs.
  Now, therefore, may but my advice prevail,
  Back to your country, Lycians! so, at once,
  Shall remediless ruin fall on Troy.
  For had the Trojans now a daring heart                         190
  Intrepid, such as in the breast resides
  Of laborers in their country's dear behalf,
  We soon should drag Patroclus into Troy;
  And were his body, from the battle drawn,
  In Priam's royal city once secured,                            195
  As soon, the Argives would in ransom give
  Sarpedon's body with his splendid arms
  To be conducted safe into the town.
  For when Patroclus fell, the friend was slain
  Of such a Chief as is not in the fleet                         200
  For valor, and his bands are dauntless all.
  But thou, at the first glimpse of Ajax' eye
  Confounded, hast not dared in arms to face
  That warrior bold, superior far to thee.
    To whom brave Hector, frowning stern, replied,               205
  Why, Glaucus! should a Chief like thee his tongue
  Presume to employ thus haughtily? My friend!
  I thee accounted wisest, once, of all
  Who dwell in fruitful Lycia, but thy speech
  Now utter'd altogether merits blame,                           210
  In which thou tell'st me that I fear to stand
  Against vast Ajax. Know that I from fight
  Shrink not, nor yet from sound of prancing steeds;
  But Jove's high purpose evermore prevails
  Against the thoughts of man; he turns to flight                215
  The bravest, and the victory takes with ease
  Even from those whom once he favor'd most.
  But hither, friend! stand with me; mark my deed;
  Prove me, if I be found, as thou hast said,
  An idler all the day, or if by force                           220
  I not compel some Grecian to renounce
  Patroclus, even the boldest of them all.
    He ceased, and to his host exclaim'd aloud.
  Trojans, and Lycians, and close-fighting sons
  Of Dardanus, oh be ye men, my friends!                         225
  Now summon all your fortitude, while I
  Put on the armor of Achilles, won
  From the renown'd Patroclus slain by me.
    So saying, illustrious Hector from the clash
  Of spears withdrew, and with his swiftest pace                 230
  Departing, overtook, not far remote,
  The bearers of Achilles' arms to Troy.
  Apart from all the horrors of the field
  Standing, he changed his armor; gave his own
  To be by them to sacred Ilium borne,                           235
  And the immortal arms of Peleus' son
  Achilles, by the ever-living Gods
  To Peleues given, put on. Those arms the Sire,
  Now old himself, had on his son conferr'd
  But in those arms his son grew never old.                      240
    Him, therefore, soon as cloud-assembler Jove
  Saw glittering in divine Achilles' arms,
  Contemplative he shook his brows, and said,
    Ah hapless Chief! thy death, although at hand,
  Nought troubles thee. Thou wear'st his heavenly                245
  Who all excels, terror of Ilium's host.
  His friend, though bold yet gentle, thou hast slain
  And hast the brows and bosom of the dead
  Unseemly bared: yet, bright success awhile
  I give thee; so compensating thy lot,                          250
  From whom Andromache shall ne'er receive
  Those glorious arms, for thou shalt ne'er return.
    So spake the Thunderer, and his sable brows
  Shaking, confirm'd the word. But Hector found
  The armor apt; the God of war his soul                         255
  With fury fill'd, he felt his limbs afresh
  Invigorated, and with loudest shouts
  Return'd to his illustrious allies.
  To them he seem'd, clad in those radiant arms,
  Himself Achilles; rank by rank he pass'd                       260
  Through all the host, exhorting every Chief,
  Asteropaeus, Mesthles, Phorcys, Medon,
  Thersilochus, Deisenor, augur Ennomus,
  Chromius, Hippothoues; all these he roused
  To battle, and in accents wing'd began.                        265
    Hear me, ye myriads, neighbors and allies!
  For not through fond desire to fill the plain
  With multitudes, have I convened you here
  Each from his city, but that well-inclined
  To Ilium, ye might help to guard our wives                     270
  And little ones against the host of Greece.
  Therefore it is that forage large and gifts
  Providing for you, I exhaust the stores
  Of Troy, and drain our people for your sake.
  Turn then direct against them, and his life                    275
  Save each, or lose; it is the course of war.
  Him who shall drag, though dead, Patroclus home
  Into the host of Troy, and shall repulse
  Ajax, I will reward with half the spoils
  And half shall be my own; glory and praise                     280
  Shall also be his meed, equal to mine.
    He ended; they compact with lifted spears
  Bore on the Danai, conceiving each
  Warm expectation in his heart to wrest
  From Ajax son of Telamon, the dead.                            285
  Vain hope! he many a lifeless Trojan heap'd
  On slain Patroclus, but at length his speech
  To warlike Menelaus thus address'd.
    Ah, Menelaus, valiant friend! I hope
  No longer, now, that even we shall 'scape                      290
  Ourselves from fight; nor fear I so the loss
  Of dead Patroclus, who shall soon the dogs
  Of Ilium, and the fowls sate with his flesh,
  As for my life I tremble and for thine,
  That cloud of battle, Hector, such a gloom                     295
  Sheds all around; death manifest impends.
  Haste--call our best, if even they can hear.
    He spake, nor Menelaus not complied,
  But call'd aloud on all the Chiefs of Greece.
    Friends, senators, and leaders of the powers                 300
  Of Argos! who with Agamemnon drink
  And Menelaus at the public feast,
  Each bearing rule o'er many, by the will
  Of Jove advanced to honor and renown!
  The task were difficult to single out                          305
  Chief after Chief by name amid the blaze
  Of such contention; but oh, come yourselves
  Indignant forth, nor let the dogs of Troy
  Patroclus rend, and gambol with his bones!
    He ceased, whom Oiliades the swift                           310
  Hearing incontinent, of all the Chiefs
  Ran foremost, after whom Idomeneus
  Approach'd, and dread as homicidal Mars
  Meriones. But never mind of man
  Could even in silent recollection name                         315
  The whole vast multitude who, following these
  Renew'd the battle on the part of Greece.
  The Trojans first, with Hector at their head,
  Wedged in close phalanx, rush'd to the assault
    As when within some rapid river's mouth                      320
  The billows and stream clash, on either shore[3]
  Loud sounds the roar[3] of waves ejected wide,
  Such seem'd the clamors of the Trojan host.
  But the Achaians, one in heart, around
  Patroclus stood, bulwark'd with shields of brass               325
  And over all their glittering helmets Jove
  Darkness diffused, for he had loved Patroclus
  While yet he lived friend of AEacides,
  And now, abhorring that the dogs of Troy
  Should eat him, urged the Greeks to his defence,               330
  The host of Troy first shook the Grecian host;
  The body left, they fled; yet of them all,
  The Trojan powers, determined as they were,
  Slew none, but dragg'd the body. Neither stood
  The Greeks long time aloof, soon as repulsed                   335
  Again led on by Ajax, who in form
  And in exploits all others far excell'd.
  Peerless AEacides alone except.
  Right through the foremost combatants he rush'd,
  In force resembling most some savage boar                      340
  That in the mountains bursting through the brakes,
  The swains disperses and their hounds with ease;
  Like him, illustrious Ajax, mighty son
  Of Telamon, at his assault dispersed
  With ease the close imbattled ranks who fought                 345
  Around Patroclus' body, strong in hope
  To achieve it, and to make the glory theirs.
  Hippothoues, a youth of high renown,
  Son of Pelasgian Lethus, by a noose
  Around his ancle cast dragg'd through the fight                350
  Patroclus, so to gratify the host
  Of Ilium and their Chief; but evil him
  Reached suddenly, by none of all his friends
  (Though numerous wish'd to save him) turn'd aside.
  For swift advancing on him through the crowd                   355
  The son of Telamon pierced, spear in hand,
  His helmet brazen-cheek'd; the crested casque,
  So smitten, open'd wide, for huge the hand
  And ponderous was the spear that gave the blow
  And all around its neck, mingled with blood                    360
  Gush'd forth the brain. There, lifeless, down he sank,
  Let fall the hero's foot, and fell himself
  Prone on the dead, never to see again?
  Deep-soil'd Larissa, never to require
  Their kind solicitudes who gave him birth,                     365
  In bloom of life by dauntless Ajax slain.
  Then Hector hurl'd at Ajax his bright spear,
  But he, forewarn'd of its approach, escaped
  Narrowly, and it pierced Schedius instead,
  Brave son of Iphitus; he, noblest Chief                        370
  Of the Phocensians, over many reign'd,
  Dwelling in Panopeus the far-renown'd.
  Entering beneath the clavicle[4] the point
  Right through his shoulder's summit pass'd behind,
  And on his loud-resounding arms he fell.                       375
  But Ajax at his waist wounded the son
  Of Phoenops, valiant Phorcys, while he stood
  Guarding Hippothoeus; through his hollow mail
  Enforced the weapon drank his inmost life,
  And in his palm, supine, he clench'd the dust.                 380
  Then, Hector with the foremost Chiefs of Troy
  Fell back; the Argives sent a shout to heaven,
  And dragging Phorcys and Hippothoeus thence
  Stripp'd both. In that bright moment Ilium's host
  Fear-quell'd before Achaia's warlike sons                      385
  Had Troy re-enter'd, and the host of Greece
  By matchless might and fortitude their own
  Had snatch'd a victory from the grasp of fate,
  But that, himself, the King of radiant shafts
  AEneas roused; Epytis' son he seem'd                            390
  Periphas, ancient in the service grown
  Of old Anchises whom he dearly loved;
  His form assumed, Apollo thus began.
    How could ye save, AEneas, were the Gods
  Your enemies, the towers of lofty Troy?                        395
  As I have others seen, warriors who would,
  Men fill'd with might and valor, firm themselves
  And Chiefs of multitudes disdaining fear.
  But Jove to us the victory far more
  Than to the Grecians wills; therefore the fault                400
  Is yours, who tremble and refuse the fight.
    He ended, whom AEneas marking, knew
  At once the glorious Archer of the skies,
  And thus to distant Hector call'd aloud.
    Oh, Hector, and ye other Chiefs of Troy                      405
  And of her brave confederates! Shame it were
  Should we re-enter Ilium, driven to flight
  By dastard fear before the host of Greece.
  A God assured me even now, that Jove,
  Supreme in battle, gives his aid to Troy.                      410
  Rush, therefore, on the Danai direct,
  Nor let them, safe at least and unannoy'd,
  Bear hence Patroclus' body to the fleet.
    He spake, and starting far into the van
  Stood foremost forth; they, wheeling, faced the Greeks.        415
  Then, spear in hand, AEneas smote the friend
  Of Lycomedes, brave Leocritus,
  Son of Arisbas. Lycomedes saw
  Compassionate his death, and drawing nigh
  First stood, then hurling his resplendent lance,               420
  Right through the liver Apisaon pierced
  Offspring of Hippasus, his chest beneath,
  And, lifeless, instant, on the field he fell.
  He from Paeonia the deep soil'd to Troy
  Came forth, Asteropaeus sole except,                            425
  Bravest of all Paeonia's band in arms.
  Asteropaeus saw, and to the van
  Sprang forth for furious combat well prepared,
  But room for fight found none, so thick a fence
  Of shields and ported spears fronted secure                    430
  The phalanx guarding Menoetiades.
  For Ajax ranging all the ranks, aloud
  Admonish'd them that no man yielding ground
  Should leave Patroclus, or advance before
  The rest, but all alike fight and stand fast.                  435
  Such order gave huge Ajax; purple gore
  Drench'd all the ground; in slaughter'd heaps they fell
  Trojans and Trojan aids of dauntless hearts
  And Grecians; for not even they the fight
  Waged bloodless, though with far less cost of blood,           440
  Each mindful to avert his fellow's fate.
    Thus burn'd the battle; neither hadst thou deem'd
  The sun himself in heaven unquench'd, or moon,
  Beneath a cope so dense of darkness strove
  Unceasing all the most renown'd in arms                        445
  For Menoetiades. Meantime the war,
  Wherever else, the bright-arm'd Grecians waged
  And Trojans under skies serene. The sun
  On them his radiance darted; not a cloud,
  From mountain or from vale rising, allay'd                     450
  His fervor; there at distance due they fought
  And paused by turns, and shunn'd the cruel dart.
  But in the middle field not war alone
  They suffer'd, but night also; ruthless raged
  The iron storm, and all the mightiest bled.                    455
  Two glorious Chiefs, the while, Antilochus
  And Thrasymedes, had no tidings heard
  Of brave Patroclus slain, but deem'd him still
  Living, and troubling still the host of Troy;
  For watchful[5] only to prevent the flight                     460
  Or slaughter of their fellow-warriors, they
  Maintain'd a distant station, so enjoin'd
  By Nestor when he sent them to the field.
  But fiery conflict arduous employ'd
  The rest all day continual; knees and legs,                    465
  Feet, hands, and eyes of those who fought to guard
  The valiant friend of swift AEacides
  Sweat gather'd foul and dust. As when a man
  A huge ox-hide drunken with slippery lard
  Gives to be stretch'd, his servants all around                 470
  Disposed, just intervals between, the task
  Ply strenuous, and while many straining hard
  Extend it equal on all sides, it sweats
  The moisture out, and drinks the unction in,[6]
  So they, in narrow space struggling, the dead                  475
  Dragg'd every way, warm hope conceiving, these
  To drag him thence to Troy, those, to the ships.
  Wild tumult raged around him; neither Mars,
  Gatherer of hosts to battle, nor herself
  Pallas, however angry, had beheld                              480
  That conflict with disdain, Jove to such length
  Protracted on that day the bloody toil
  Of steeds and men for Menoetiades.
  Nor knew divine Achilles or had aught
  Heard of Patroclus slain, for from the ships                   485
  Remote they fought, beneath the walls of Troy.
  He, therefore, fear'd not for his death, but hope
  Indulged much rather, that, the battle push'd
  To Ilium's gates, he should return alive.
  For that his friend, unaided by himself                        490
  Or ever aided, should prevail to lay
  Troy waste, he nought supposed; by Thetis warn'd
  In secret conference oft, he better knew
  Jove's purpose; yet not even she had borne
  Those dreadful tidings to his ear, the loss                    495
  Immeasurable of his dearest friend.
    They all around the dead fought spear in hand
  With mutual slaughter ceaseless, and amid
  Achaia's host thus spake a Chief mail-arm'd.
    Shame were it, Grecians! should we seek by flight            500
  Our galleys now; yawn earth our feet beneath
  And here ingulf us rather! Better far
  Than to permit the steed-famed host of Troy
  To drag Patroclus hence into the town,
  And make the glory of this conflict theirs.                    505
    Thus also of the dauntless Trojans spake
  A certain warrior. Oh, my friends! although
  The Fates ordain us, one and all, to die
  Around this body, stand! quit not the field.
    So spake the warrior prompting into act                      510
  The courage of his friends, and such they strove
  On both sides; high into the vault of heaven
  The iron din pass'd through the desart air.
  Meantime the horses of AEacides
  From fight withdrawn, soon as they understood                  515
  Their charioteer fallen in the dust beneath
  The arm of homicidal Hector, wept.
  Them oft with hasty lash Diores' son
  Automedon impatient smote, full oft
  He stroked them gently, and as oft he chode;[7]                520
  Yet neither to the fleet ranged on the shore
  Of spacious Hellespont would they return,
  Nor with the Grecians seek the fight, but stood
  As a sepulchral pillar stands, unmoved
  Between their traces;[8] to the earth they hung                525
  Their heads, with plenteous tears their driver mourn'd,
  And mingled their dishevell'd manes with dust.
  Jove saw their grief with pity, and his brows
  Shaking, within himself thus, pensive, said.
    Ah hapless pair! Wherefore by gift divine                    530
  Were ye to Peleus given, a mortal king,
  Yourselves immortal and from age exempt?
  Was it that ye might share in human woes?
  For, of all things that breathe or creep the earth,
  No creature lives so mere a wretch as man.                     535
  Yet shall not Priameian Hector ride
  Triumphant, drawn by you. Myself forbid.
  Suffice it that he boasts vain-gloriously
  Those arms his own. Your spirit and your limbs
  I will invigorate, that ye may bear                            540
  Safe hence Automedon into the fleet.
  For I ordain the Trojans still to spread
  Carnage around victorious, till they reach
  The gallant barks, and till the sun at length
  Descending, sacred darkness cover all.                         545
    He said, and with new might the steeds inspired.
  They, shaking from their hair profuse the dust,
  Between the van of either army whirl'd
  The rapid chariot. Fighting as he pass'd,
  Though fill'd with sorrow for his slaughter'd friend,          550
  Automedon high-mounted swept the field
  Impetuous as a vulture scattering geese;
  Now would he vanish, and now, turn'd again,
  Chase through a multitude his trembling foe;
  But whomsoe'er he follow'd, none he slew,                      555
  Nor was the task possible to a Chief
  Sole in the sacred chariot, both to aim
  The spear aright and guide the fiery steeds.
  At length Alcimedon, his friend in arms,
  Son of Laerceus son of AEmon, him                               560
  Observing, from behind the chariot hail'd
  The flying warrior, whom he thus bespake.
    What power, Automedon! hath ta'en away
  Thy better judgment, and thy breast inspired
  With this vain purpose to assail alone                         565
  The Trojan van? Thy partner in the fight
  Is slain, and Hector on his shoulders bears,
  Elate, the armor of AEacides.
    Then, answer thus Automedon return'd,
  Son of Diores. Who of all our host                             570
  Was ever skill'd, Alcimedon! as thou
  To rule the fire of these immortal steeds,
  Save only while he lived, peer of the Gods
  In that great art, Patroclus, now no more?
  Thou, therefore, the resplendent reins receive                 575
  And scourge, while I, dismounting, wage the fight.
    He ceased; Alcimedon without delay
  The battle-chariot mounting, seized at once
  The lash and reins, and from his seat down leap'd
  Automedon. Them noble Hector mark'd,                           580
  And to AEneas at his side began.
    Illustrious Chief of Trojans brazen-mail'd
  AEneas! I have noticed yonder steeds
  Of swift Achilles rushing into fight
  Conspicuous, but under sway of hands                           585
  Unskilful; whence arises a fair hope
  That we might seize them, wert thou so inclined;
  For never would those two dare to oppose
  In battle an assault dreadful as ours.
    He ended, nor the valiant son refused                        590
  Of old Anchises, but with targets firm
  Of season'd hide brass-plated thrown athwart
  Their shoulders, both advanced direct, with whom
  Of godlike form Aretus also went
  And Chromius. Ardent hope they all conceived                   595
  To slay those Chiefs, and from the field to drive
  Achilles' lofty steeds. Vain hope! for them
  No bloodless strife awaited with the force
  Of brave Automedon; he, prayer to Jove
  First offering, felt his angry soul with might                 600
  Heroic fill'd, and thus his faithful friend
  Alcimedon, incontinent, address'd.
    Alcimedon! hold not the steeds remote
  But breathing on my back; for I expect
  That never Priameian Hector's rage                             605
  Shall limit know, or pause, till, slaying us,
  He shall himself the coursers ample-maned
  Mount of Achilles, and to flight compel
  The Argive host, or perish in the van.
    So saying, he call'd aloud on Menelaus                       610
  With either Ajax. Oh, illustrious Chiefs
  Of Argos, Menelaus, and ye bold
  Ajaces![9] leaving all your best to cope
  With Ilium's powers and to protect the dead,
  From friends still living ward the bitter day.                 615
  For hither borne, two Chiefs, bravest of all
  The Trojans, Hector and AEneas rush
  Right through the battle. The events of war
  Heaven orders; therefore even I will give
  My spear its flight, and Jove dispose the rest!                620
    He said, and brandishing his massy spear
  Dismiss'd it at Aretus; full he smote
  His ample shield, nor stay'd the pointed brass,
  But penetrating sheer the disk, his belt
  Pierced also, and stood planted in his waist.                  625
  As when some vigorous youth with sharpen'd axe
  A pastured bullock smites behind the horns
  And hews the muscle through; he, at the stroke
  Springs forth and falls, so sprang Aretus forth,
  Then fell supine, and in his bowels stood                      630
  The keen-edged lance still quivering till he died.
  Then Hector, in return, his radiant spear
  Hurl'd at Automedon, who of its flight
  Forewarn'd his body bowing prone, the stroke
  Eluded, and the spear piercing the soil                        635
  Behind him, shook to its superior end,
  Till, spent by slow degrees, its fury slept.
  And now, with hand to hilt, for closer war
  Both stood prepared, when through the multitude
  Advancing at their fellow-warrior's call,                      640
  The Ajaces suddenly their combat fierce
  Prevented. Awed at once by their approach
  Hector retired, with whom AEneas went
  Also and godlike Chromius, leaving there
  Aretus with his vitals torn, whose arms,                       645
  Fierce as the God of war Automedon
  Stripp'd off, and thus exulted o'er the slain.
    My soul some portion of her grief resigns
  Consoled, although by slaughter of a worse,
  For loss of valiant Menoetiades.                               650
    So saying, within his chariot he disposed
  The gory spoils, then mounted it himself
  With hands and feet purpled, as from a bull
  His bloody prey, some lion newly-gorged.
    And now around Patroclus raged again                         655
  Dread strife deplorable! for from the skies
  Descending at the Thunderer's command
  Whose purpose now was to assist the Greeks,
  Pallas enhanced the fury of the fight.
  As when from heaven, in view of mortals, Jove                  660
  Exhibits bright his bow, a sign ordain'd
  Of war, or numbing frost which all the works
  Suspends of man and saddens all the flocks;
  So she, all mantled with a radiant cloud
  Entering Achaia's host, fired every breast.                    665
  But meeting Menelaus first, brave son
  Of Atreus, in the form and with the voice
  Robust of Phoenix, him she thus bespake.
    Shame, Menelaus, shall to thee redound
  For ever, and reproach, should dogs devour                     670
  The faithful friend of Peleus' noble son
  Under Troy's battlements; but stand, thyself,
  Undaunted, and encourage all the host.
    To whom the son of Atreus bold in arms.
  Ah, Phoenix, friend revered, ancient and sage!                 675
  Would Pallas give me might and from the dint
  Shield me of dart and spear, with willing mind
  I would defend Patroclus, for his death
  Hath touch'd me deep. But Hector with the rage
  Burns of consuming fire, nor to his spear                      680
  Gives pause, for him Jove leads to victory.
    He ceased, whom Pallas, Goddess azure-eyed
  Hearing, rejoiced that of the heavenly powers
  He had invoked _her_ foremost to his aid.
  His shoulders with new might, and limbs she fill'd,            685
  And persevering boldness to his breast
  Imparted, such as prompts the fly, which oft
  From flesh of man repulsed, her purpose yet
  To bite holds fast, resolved on human blood.
  His stormy bosom with such courage fill'd                      690
  By Pallas, to Patroclus he approach'd
  And hurl'd, incontinent, his glittering spear.
  There was a Trojan Chief, Podes by name,
  Son of Eetion, valorous and rich;
  Of all Troy's citizens him Hector most                         695
  Respected, in convivial pleasures sweet
  His chosen companion. As he sprang to flight,
  The hero of the golden locks his belt
  Struck with full force and sent the weapon through.
  Sounding he fell, and from the Trojan ranks                    700
  Atrides dragg'd the body to his own.
  Then drew Apollo near to Hector's side,
  And in the form of Phoenops, Asius' son,
  Of all the foreign guests at Hector's board
  His favorite most, the hero thus address'd.                    705
    What Chief of all the Grecians shall henceforth
  Fear Hector, who from Menelaus shrinks
  Once deem'd effeminate, but dragging now
  The body of thy valiant friend approved
  Whom he hath slain, Podes, Eetion's son?                       710
    He spake, and at his words grief like a cloud
  Involved the mind of Hector dark around;
  Right through the foremost combatants he rush'd
  All clad in dazzling brass. Then, lifting high
  His tassel'd AEgis radiant, Jove with storms                    715
  Enveloped Ida; flash'd his lightnings, roar'd
  His thunders, and the mountain shook throughout.
  Troy's host he prosper'd, and the Greeks dispersed.
    First fled Peneleus, the Boeotian Chief,
  Whom facing firm the foe Polydamas                             720
  Struck on his shoulder's summit with a lance
  Hurl'd nigh at hand, which slight inscribed the bone.
  [10]Leitus also, son of the renown'd
  Alectryon, pierced by Hector in the wrist,
  Disabled left the fight; trembling he fled                     725
  And peering narrowly around, nor hoped
  To lift a spear against the Trojans more.
  Hector, pursuing Leitus, the point
  Encounter'd of the brave Idomeneus
  Full on his chest; but in his mail the lance                   730
  Snapp'd, and the Trojans shouted to the skies.
  He, in his turn, cast at Deucalion's son
  Idomeneus, who in that moment gain'd[11]
  A chariot-seat; but him the erring spear
  Attain'd not, piercing Coeranus instead                        735
  The friend and follower of Meriones
  From wealthy Lyctus, and his charioteer.
  For when he left, that day, the gallant barks
  Idomeneus had sought the field on foot,
  And triumph proud, full sure, to Ilium's host                  740
  Had yielded now, but that with rapid haste
  Coeranus drove to his relief, from him
  The fate averting which himself incurr'd
  Victim of Hector's homicidal arm.
  Him Hector smiting between ear and jaw                         745
  Push'd from their sockets with the lance's point
