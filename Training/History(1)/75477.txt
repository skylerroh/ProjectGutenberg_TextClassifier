had just been brought by two messengers from Syria.  Among them were some
which must be answered without delay.  The Keeper of the Seal and the
Exegetus were also waiting.  Their late visit was due to the necessity of
holding a conference in relation to the measures to be adopted to calm
the excited citizens.  All the galleys which had escaped from the battle
had entered the harbour the day before, wreathed with garlands as if a
great victory had been won.  Loud acclamations greeted them, yet tidings
of the defeat at Actium spread with the swiftness of the wind.  Crowds
were now gathering, threatening demonstrations had been made in front of
the Sebasteum, and on the square of the Serapeum the troops had been
compelled to interfere, and blood had flowed.

There lay the letters.  Zeno remarked that more papers conferring
authority were required for the work on the canal, and the Exegetus
earnestly besought definite instruction.

"It is much--much,"  murmured  Cleopatra.  Then, drawing herself up to
her full height, she exclaimed, "Well, then, to work!"

But Alexas did not permit her to do this at once.  Humbly advancing as
she took her seat at the large writing-table, he whispered: "And with all
this, must my royal mistress devote time and thought to the destroyer of
her peace.  To disturb your Majesty with this trifle is a crime; yet it
must be committed, for should the affair remain unheeded longer, the
trickling rivulet may become a mountain torrent--"

Here Cleopatra, whose glance had just rested upon a fateful letter from
King Herod, turned her face half towards her husband's favourite,
exclaiming curtly, with glowing cheeks, "Presently."

"Then she glanced rapidly over the letter, pushed it excitedly aside, and
dismissed the waiting Syrian with the impatient words: "Attend to the
trial and the rest.  No injustice, but no untimely mildness.  I will look
into this unpleasant matter myself before the Imperator returns."

"And the authority?"  asked the Syrian, with another low bow.

"You have it.  If you need a written one, apply to Zeno.  We will discuss
the affair further at some less busy hour."

The Syrian retired; but Cleopatra turned to the eunuch and, flushed with
emotion, cried, pointing to the King of Judea's letter:  "Did you ever
witness baser ingratitude?  The rats think the ship is sinking, and it is
time to leave it.  If we succeed in keeping above water, they will return
in swarms; and this must, must, must be done, for the sake of this
beloved country and her independence.  Then the children, the children!
All our powers must now be taxed, every expedient must be remembered and
used.  We will hammer each feeble hope until it becomes the strong steel
of certainty.  We will transform night into day.  The canal will save the
fleet.  Mark Antony will find in Africa Pinarius Scarpus with untouched
loyal legions.  The gladiators are faithful to us.  We can easily make
them ours, and my brain is seething with other plans.  But first we will
attend to the Alexandrians.  No violence!"

This exclamation was followed by order after order, and the promise that,
if necessary, she would show herself to the people.

The Exegetus was filled with admiration as he received the clear,
sagacious directions.  After he had retired with his companions, the
Queen again turned to the Regent, saying: "We did wisely to make the
people happy at first with tidings of victory.  The unexpected news of
terrible disaster might have led them to some unprecedented deed of
madness.  Disappointment is a more common pain, for which less powerful
remedies will suffice.  Besides, many things could be arranged ere they
knew that I was here.  How much we have accomplished already, Mardion!
But I have not even granted myself the joy of seeing my children.  I was
forced to defer the pleasure of the companionship of my oldest friends,
even Archibius.  When he comes again he will be admitted.  I have given
the order.  He knows Rome thoroughly.  I must hear his opinion of pending
negotiations."

She shivered as she spoke, and pressing her hand upon her brow,
exclaimed: "Octavianus victor, Cleopatra vanquished!  I, who was
everything to Caesar, beseeching mercy from his heir.  I, a petitioner to
Octavia's brother!  Yet, no, no!  There are still a hundred chances of
avoiding the horrible doom.  But whoever wishes to compel the field to
bear fruits must dig sturdily, draw the buckets from the well, plough,
and sow the seed.  To work, then, to work!  When Antony returns he must
find all things ready.  The first success will restore his lost energy.
I glanced through yonder letter while talking with the Exegetus; now I
will dictate the answer."

So she sat reading, writing, and dictating, listening, answering, and
giving orders, until the east brightened with the approach of dawn, the
morning star grew pale, and the Regent, utterly exhausted, entreated her
to consider her own health and his years, and permit him a few hours'
rest.

Then she, too, allowed herself to be led into her darkened chamber, and
this time a friendly, dreamless slumber closed her weary eyes and held
her captive until roused by the loud shouts of the multitude, who had
heard of the Queen's return and flocked to Lochias.
