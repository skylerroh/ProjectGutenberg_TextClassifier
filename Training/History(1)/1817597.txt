     novelty. Put before us by the pen of a master like Jokai, the
     effect is to stir and interest in an unusual degree."--_Daily
     Chronicle._

SOME PRESS OPINIONS.

     Daily Chronicle--

     "A work of no small merit and ability. It supplies a long-felt
     want. Dr. Reich has evidently read up his subject with care and
     conscientiousness, and displays no small ability in marshalling an
     immense array of facts. He has presented us with an exceedingly
     lucid and pregnant account of one of the most original and
     fascinating literatures of Europe."

     Sunday Times--

     "Dr. Reich has done us a very real service, and his work should be
     widely known, and take a permanent place among our literary
     reference books."

     The Globe--

     "It should be in great demand among those who desire to add to
     their knowledge of European poetry and fiction."

     Academy--

     "An excellent piece of work, lucid, and well proportioned,
     displaying considerable critical faculty and great historical
     knowledge."

     Bookseller--

     "We hope the volume will find a wide circulation among educated
     English readers."


"Thomas Moore":

_Being Anecdotes, Bon-mots, and Epigrams from the Journal of Thomas
Moore._

Edited, with Notes, by WILMOT HARRISON, Author of "Memorable
London Houses," etc. With Special Introduction by RICHARD
GARNETT, LL.D., and Frontispiece Portrait of Thomas Moore.

Crown 8vo. Cloth neat, 3/6.


SOME PRESS OPINIONS.

     The Morning Leader--

     "No happier beginning could have been made than by the anecdotes,
     bon-mots, and epigrams from the 'Journal of Thomas Moore.' The fame
     of Moore as a poet has sadly diminished since his death. All the
     more, therefore, as Mr. Richard Garnett, in his scholarly
     introduction demands, should we be glad to preserve his name and
     fame as a raconteur, a story-teller who carries us irresistibly
     back to the very atmosphere breathed by Byron and Washington
     Irving."

     Literature--

     "Mr. Garnett's introduction gives a delightful picture of the man
     and his social charm. The collection is a storehouse of good things
     said by men noted for the brilliance of their conversation. Much
     pleasure can be extracted, and no small knowledge of an intensely
     social period."

     Pall Mall Gazette--

     "Every one of the pages has sparkle and animation in it, Moore knew
     everybody worth knowing in his time, and he introduces us to men
     who have taken their places in history--not by any formidable
     description, but with an enjoyable joke and a good-natured story."
