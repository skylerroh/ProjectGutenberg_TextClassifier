     full of empty sound, unpolished, bombastic, using rugged
     words?" And hereupon you can't think how my heart
     panted. But, nevertheless, I restrained my passion, and
     said, "At least recite some passage of the more modern
     poets, of whatever kind these clever things be." And he
     immediately sang a passage of Euripides, how a brother,
     O averter of ill! Debauched his uterine sister. And I
     bore it no longer, but immediately assailed him with
     many abusive reproaches. And then, after that, as was
     natural, we hurled word upon word. Then he springs upon
     me; and then he was wounding me, and beating me, and
     throttling me.

     Phid. Were you not therefore justly beaten, who do not
     praise Euripides, the wisest of poets?

     Strep. He the wisest! Oh, what shall I call you? But I
     shall be beaten again.

     Phid. Yes, by Jupiter, with justice?

     Strep. Why, how with justice? Who, O shameless fellow,
     reared you, understanding all your wishes, when you
     lisped what you meant? If you said bryn, I,
     understanding it, used to give you to drink. And when
     you asked for mamman, I used to come to you with bread.
     And you used no sooner to say caccan, than I used to
     take and carry you out of doors, and hold you before me.
     But you now, throttling me who was bawling and crying
     out because I wanted to ease myself, had not the heart
     to carry me forth out of doors, you wretch; but I did it
     there while I was being throttled.

     Cho. I fancy the hearts of the youths are panting to
     hear what he will say. For if, after having done such
     things, he shall persuade him by speaking, I would not
     take the hide of the old folks, even at the price of a
     chick-pea. It is thy business, thou author and upheaver
     of new words, to seek some means of persuasion, so that
     you shall seem to speak justly.

     Phid. How pleasant it is to be acquainted with new and
     clever things, and to be able to despise the established
     laws! For I, when I applied my mind to horsemanship
     alone, used not to be able to utter three words before I
     made a mistake; but now, since he himself has made me
     cease from these pursuits, and I am acquainted with
     subtle thoughts, and arguments, and speculations, I
     think I shall demonstrate that it is just to chastise
     one's father.

     Strep. Ride, then, by Jupiter! Since it is better for me
     to keep a team of four horses than to be killed with a
     beating.

     Phid. I will pass over to that part of my discourse
     where you interrupted me; and first I will ask you this:
     Did you beat me when I was a boy?

     Strep. I did, through good-will and concern for you.

     Phid. Pray tell me, is it not just that I also should be
     well inclined toward you in the same way, and beat you,
     since this is to be well inclined-to give a beating? For
     why ought your body to be exempt from blows and mine
     not? And yet I too was born free. The boys weep, and do
     you not think it is right that a father should weep? You
     will say that it is ordained by law that this should be
     the lot of boys. But I would reply, that old men are
     boys twice over, and that it is the more reasonable that
     the old should weep than the young, inasmuch as it is
     less just that they should err.

     Strep. It is nowhere ordained by law that a father
     should suffer this.

     Phid. Was it not then a man like you and me, who first
     proposed this law, and by speaking persuaded the
     ancients? Why then is it less lawful for me also in turn
     to propose henceforth a new law for the sons, that they
     should beat their fathers in turn? But as many blows as
     we received before the law was made, we remit: and we
     concede to them our having been thrashed without return.
     Observe the cocks and these other animals, how they
     punish their fathers; and yet, in what do they differ
     from us, except that they do not write decrees?

     Strep. Why then, since you imitate the cocks in all
     things, do you not both eat dung and sleep on a perch?

     Phid. It is not the same thing, my friend; nor would it
     appear so to Socrates.

     Strep. Therefore do not beat me; otherwise you will one
     day blame yourself.

     Phid. Why, how?

     Strep. Since I am justly entitled to chastise you; and
     you to chastise your son, if you should have one.

     Phid. But if I should not have one, I shall have wept
     for nothing, and you will die laughing at me.

     Strep. To me, indeed, O comrades, he seems to speak
     justly; and I think we ought to concede to them what is
     fitting. For it is proper that we should weep, if we do
     not act justly.

     Phid. Consider still another maxim.

     Strep. No; for I shall perish if I do.

     Phid. And yet perhaps you will not be vexed at suffering
     what you now suffer.

     Strep. How, pray? For inform me what good you will do me
     by this.

     Phid. I will beat my mother, just as I have you.

     Strep. What do you say? What do you say? This other,
     again, is a greater wickedness.

     Phid. But what if, having the worst Cause, I shall
     conquer you in arguing, proving that it is right to beat
     one's mother?

     Strep. Most assuredly, if you do this, nothing will
     hinder you from casting yourself and your Worse Cause
     into the pit along with Socrates. These evils have I
     suffered through you, O Clouds! Having intrusted all my
     affairs to you.

     Cho. Nay, rather, you are yourself  the cause of these
     things, having turned yourself to wicked courses.

     Strep. Why, pray, did you not tell me this, then, but
     excited with hopes a rustic and aged man?

     Cho. We always do this to him whom we perceive to be a
     lover of wicked courses, until we precipitate him into
     misfortune, so that he may learn to fear the gods.

     Strep. Ah me! it is severe, O Clouds! But it is just;
     for I ought not to have withheld the money which I
     borrowed. Now, therefore, come with me, my dearest son,
     that you may destroy the blackguard Chaerephon and
     Socrates, who deceived you and me.

     Phid. I will not injure my teachers.

     Strep. Yes, yes, reverence Paternal Jove.

     Phid. "Paternal Jove" quoth'a! How antiquated you are!
     Why, is there any Jove?

     Strep. There is.

     Phid. There is not, no; for Vortex reigns having
     expelled Jupiter.

     Strep. He has not expelled him; but I fancied this, on
     account of this Vortex here. Ah me, unhappy man! When I
     even took you who are of earthenware for a god.

     Phid. Here rave and babble to yourself.

     [Exit Phidippides]

     Strep. Ah me, what madness! How mad, then, I was when I
     ejected the gods on account of Socrates! But O dear
     Hermes, by no means be wroth with me, nor destroy me;
     but pardon me, since I have gone crazy through prating.
     And become my adviser, whether I shall bring an action
     and prosecute them, or whatever you think. You advise me
     rightly, not permitting me to get up a lawsuit, but as
     soon as possible to set fire to the house of the prating
     fellows. Come hither, come hither, Xanthias! Come forth
     with a ladder and with a mattock and then mount upon the
     thinking-shop and dig down the roof, if you love your
     master, until you tumble the house upon them.

     [Xanthias mounts upon the roof]

     But let some one bring me a lighted torch and I'll make
     some of them this day suffer punishment, even if they be
     ever so much impostors.

     1st Dis. (from within) Hollo! Hollo!

     Strep. It is your business, O torch, to send forth
     abundant flame.

     [Mounts upon the roof]

     1st Dis. What are you doing, fellow?

     Strep. What am I doing? Why, what else, than chopping
     logic with the beams of your house?

     [Sets the house on fire]

     2nd Dis. (from within) You will destroy us! You will
     destroy us!

     Strep. For I also wish this very thing; unless my
     mattock deceive my hopes, or I should somehow fall first
     and break my neck.

     Soc. (from within). Hollo you! What are you doing, pray,
     you fellow on the roof?

     Strep. I am walking on air, and speculating about the
     sun.

     Soc. Ah me, unhappy! I shall be suffocated, wretched
     man!

     Chaer. And I, miserable man, shall be burnt to death!

     Strep. For what has come into your heads that you acted
     insolently toward the gods, and pried into the seat of
     the moon? Chase, pelt, smite them, for many reasons, but
     especially because you know that they offended against
     the gods!

     [The thinking shop is burned down]

     Cho. Lead the way out; for we have sufficiently acted as
     chorus for today.



     [Exeunt omnes]
