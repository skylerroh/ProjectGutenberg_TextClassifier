toward Barbara to greet her as an acquaintance of his school days,
flushing deeply in his surprise at her great beauty as he did so.

But the mistress of the house gave him no time to renew the relations of
childhood, and led her away from him to her husband and her mother-in-
law, a woman of ninety, to whom she presented her with kind, nay, with
extremely flattering, words.  Barbara lowered her eyes in confusion, and
did not see how, at her entrance, Wolf's face had blanched and old Frau
Hiltner had sat up in her cushioned arm-chair at the window to look her
sharply and fixedly in the eyes with the freedom of age.

Meanwhile the man from the hall had stationed himself beside the door in
the same attitude, with his hands clasped under his chin and his cap
between his breast and arm, and stood motionless.  He did not appear to
be at ease, and gnawed his thick lower lip with a troubled look as he
occasionally cast a glance at the strong countenance of Martin Luther,
whose portrait, the size of life, gazed at him from its gilt frame on the
opposite wall.

Barbara did not regain complete self-control until the syndic asked his
errand.

The man in the brown doublet was Brother Cassian, the body servant of the
Emperor's confessor.  He now unclasped his hands to grasp the cap under
his arm, which he twirled awkwardly in his fingers while saying, in a
rapid, expressionless tone, as though he were repeating a lesson, that he
had come to summon Wolf Hartschwert to the Queen of Hungary, with whom he
must set out for Brussels early the next morning.

Barbara then remarked in a subdued tone that she had come here for the
same purpose, and also for another-to shake hands with the playmate of
her childhood, because she probably would not see him again before his
departure.

Wolf listened to this statement in surprise, and then told the messenger
that he would obey her Majesty's command.

"Obey the command," Cassian repeated, according to his servant custom.
Then he was about to retire, but Frau Sabina had filled a goblet with
wine for him, and Martina, according too an old custom of the family,
offered it to the messenger.

But, much as Cassian liked the juice of the grape, he waved back the
kindly meant gift of the mistress of the house with a hoarse "No, no!"
and shaking his head, turned on his heel, and without a word of thanks or
farewell left the room.

"The heretic's wine," observed Dr. Hiltner, shrugging his shoulders
regretfully, and then asked Wolf, "Do you know the queer fellow?"

"The body servant of the almoner, Pedro de Soto," was the reply.
The bang of the closed outer door was heard at the same moment, for
Cassian had rushed into the open air as fast as his feet would carry him.
After leaving part of the street behind him, he stopped, and with a loud
"B-r-r-r!" shook himself like a poodle that has just come out of the
water.

Into what an abominable heretic house Master Adrian had sent him!

To despatch a good Christian to such an unclean hole!

No images of the Virgin and the saints, no crucifix nor anything else
that elevates a human soul in the whole dwelling, but the portrait of the
anti-Christ, the arch-heretic Luther, in the best place in the room!
However lie turned his eyes away, the fat heretic face had forced him to
look at it.  Meanwhile he had felt as if the devil himself was already
stretching out his arm from the ample sleeve to seize him by the collar.

"B-r-r-r!" he repeated, and hurried off to Saint Leonhard's chapel in the
Golden Cross, where he sprinkled himself eagerly with holy water, and
then sought Master Adrian.  But the valet was with the Emperor, and so
he went to his master and told him where he had unexpectedly wandered.

The latter lent a willing ear and shook his sagacious head indignantly
when he learned that, besides Sir Wolf Hartschwert, Cassian had also met
"the singer" at the house of the syndic, the soul of the evangelical
movement in Ratisbon.

Meanwhile Barbara was taking leave of the friend of her youth at the
Hiltner house.

The others, with the exception of the deaf old dame, had considerately
left the room.

Wolf felt it gratefully, for a dark suspicion, which Barbara's
information of her father's long ride as a messenger only confirmed,
weighed heavily upon his heart.

The man for whose sake the woman he loved had given him up must be Baron
Malfalconnet.

It was well known how recklessly this gay, gallant noble trifled with
women's hearts, and he had mentioned Barbara in his presence in a way
that justified the conjecture.

Therefore, ere Wolf clasped her hand, he told her the suspicions which
filled him with anxiety about her.

But he was soon to discover the baselessness of this fear.

Whatever the truthful girl so positively and solemnly denied must be far
from her thoughts, and he now clasped her right hand in both his.

The heavy anxiety that his "queen" had fallen into the baron's hands as a
toy had been removed.  The thought of the Emperor Charles was as far
removed from his mind as heaven from earth, though Barbara emphasized the
fact that the man whom she loved would be sure of his respect.  She also,
with deep emotion, assured him that she wished him the best and most
beautiful life, and would always retain her friendship for him whatever
Fate might have in store for both.

The words sounded so truthful and loyal that Wolf's heart was moved to
its inmost depths, and he now, in his turn, assured her that he would
never forget her, and would treasure her image in his heart's core to the
end.  True, he must endure the keenest suffering for her sake, but he
also owed her the greatest happiness life had granted him.

The eyes of both were dim, but when he began to talk in the old pathetic
way of the magic of love, which would at last bring together those whom
Heaven destined for one another, she tore herself away, hastily begged
him to say farewell to Fran Hiltner for her, and then went into the hall;
but here Martina overtook the departing guest, threw herself impetuously
into her arms, and whispered the question whether she would permit her to
pay her a visit at Prebrunn when she was with her old marquise, she had
so much, so very much, to tell her.

But the wish, of which her mother was ignorant, remained unfulfilled,
for Barbara, scarcely able to control her voice in her embarrassment,
hurriedly replied that while with the lady in waiting she would no longer
be her own mistress, pressed a hasty kiss upon the innocent child's brow,
released herself from her embrace, and rushed through the door, which
Wolf was holding open for her, into the street.

The former gazed after her with a troubled heart, and, after she was out
of sight, returned to the others.  He conscientiously delivered Barbara's
farewell, and the praise which Frau Sabina lavished upon her pleased him
as much as if nothing had come between them.  Finally he made an
engagement to see Erasmus Eckhart that evening in his lodgings,
and then went to the Queen of Hungary.

After he had left the Hiltners Frau Sabina bent down to her mother-in-
law's ear--though she had lost her quickness of hearing, she had retained
her sight perfectly--and, raising her voice, told her the name of the
young lady who had just left them.  Then she asked if she, too, did not
admire Barbara's beauty, and what she thought of her.

The grandmother nodded, exclaiming in a low tone, "Beautiful, beautiful--
a wonderfully beautiful creature!"  Then she gazed thoughtfully into
vacancy, and at last asked whether she had heard correctly that Jungfrau
Blomberg was also a remarkable singer.

Her daughter-in-law eagerly nodded assent to this question.

The aged woman silently bowed her head, but quickly raised it again, and
there was a faint tinge of regret in her voice as she began: "Too much,
certainly too much.  Such marvels are rare.  But one thing or the other.
For women of her stamp there are only two conditions, and no other--
rapturous happiness and utter misery.  She will be content with no
average.  It does not suit such natures."

Here she paused abruptly, for Martina entered the room, and with
affectionate solicitude said to her granddaughter: "Young Trainer was
here just now.  Has anything happened between you?  I see by your eyes
that you have been weeping."

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
