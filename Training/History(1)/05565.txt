BARBARA BLOMBERG

By Georg Ebers

Volume 5.


CHAPTER XXI.

The Emperor Charles loved his sister Mary, and he now desired to show her
how dear she was to his heart.  She had been obliging to him, and he had
in mind the execution of a great enterprise which she had hitherto
zealously opposed, yet for which he needed her co-operation.

It satisfied him to know that the father of his love would be absent from
Ratisbon for the present.  He did not care who accompanied him.

When the regent reproached him for having taken Sir Wolf Hartschwert from
her without a word of consultation, although she was unwilling to spare
him, he had instantly placed Wolf at her disposal again.

The simplest and cheapest plan would have been to let Blomberg pursue his
journey alone; but the monarch feared that the despatch might not be
quickly delivered if anything happened to the old man on the way, and
he had said before witnesses that he would not allow him to go without
companionship.

He scarcely thought of Barbara's filial feeling.  She loved him, and the
place which she gave to any one else in her heart could and must
therefore be extremely small.

How powerfully the passionate love for this girl had seized him he dared
not confess to himself.  But he rejoiced in the late love which
rejuvenated him and filled him with a joy in existence whose fresh
blossoming would have seemed impossible a few days before.

How superb a creature he had found in this German city, from which, since
its change of religion, he had withdrawn his former favour!  In his youth
his heart had throbbed ardently for many a fair woman, but she surpassed
in beauty, in swift intelligence, in fervour, in artistic ability, and,
above all, in sincere, unfeigned devotion every one whom his faithful
memory recalled.

He would hold fast to the loved one who bestowed this happiness and
fresh vigour of youth.  To make warm the nest which was to receive his
dear nightingale he had conquered the economy which was beginning to
degenerate into avarice, and also intended to accomplish other sacrifices
in order to procure her the position which she deserved.

He no longer knew that he had wounded her deeply the night before.  He
was in the habit of casting aside whatever displeased him unless it
appeared advantageous to impose restraint upon himself; and who would
ever have dared to resist the expression of his indignation?  Had Barbara
obeyed her hasty temper and returned him a sharp answer, he certainly
would not have forgotten it.  The bare thought of her dispelled
melancholy thoughts from his mind; the hope of soon seeing and hearing
her again rendered him friendly and yielding to those about him.  The
trivial sin which this sweet love secret contained had been pardoned in
the case of the man bound by no older obligation, after a slight penance,
and now for the first time he fully enjoyed the wealth of the unexpected
new happiness.  It must also be acceptable to Heaven, for this was
distinctly shown by the more and more favourable turn of politics,
and he held the return gift.

That it was the right one was proved by the nature of the gratifying news
brought by the very last despatches.  They urged him directly toward
the war which hitherto, from the most serious motives, he had avoided,
and, as his royal sister correctly saw, would destroy a slowly matured,
earnest purpose; for it forced him to renounce the hope of effecting at
Trent a reformation of the Church according to his own ideas, and a
restoration of the unity of religion in a peaceful manner by yielding
on one side and reasonable concessions on the other.  He had long
since perceived that many things in the old form of religion needed
reformation.  If war was declared, he would be compelled to resign the
hope that these would be undertaken by Rome, and the opposition, the
defiance, the bold rebellion of the Protestant princes destroyed every
hope of propitiation on their part.  They were forcing him to draw the
sword, and he might venture to do so at this time, for he need now feel
no fear of serious opposition from any of the great powers around him.
Maurice of Saxony, too, was on the point of withdrawing from the
Smalkalds and becoming his ally; so, with the assistance of Heaven, he
might hope to win the victory for the cause of the Church, and with it
also that of the crown.

With regard to the probability of this war, he had much to expect from
the activity of his sister in the Netherlands, and though she now
advocated peace, in the twelfth hour, which must soon strike, he could
rely upon her.  Yet she was a woman, and it was necessary to bind her
to him by every tie of the heart and intellect.

He loved Barbara as warmly as he was capable of loving; but had Mary that
evening required his separation from the singer as the price of her
assistance in promoting his plans, the desire of the heart would perhaps
have yielded to the wishes of the statesman.

But the regent did not impose this choice; she did not grudge him his
late happiness, and gratefully appreciated the transformation which
Barbara's rare gifts had wrought.

The affectionate sister's heart wished that the bond which produced so
favourable a result might be of the longest possible duration, and she
had therefore personally attended to the furnishing of the Prebrunn
house, and made all sorts of arrangements to render Barbara's life with
the marquise, not only endurable, but pleasant.

The Emperor had allowed a considerable sum for this purpose, but she did
not trouble herself about the amount allotted.  If she exceeded it,
Charles must undertake the payment, whether he desired it or not.

Her vivid imagination had showed her how she, in the Emperor's place,
would treat the object of his love, and she acted accordingly, without
questioning him or the girl for whom her arrangements were made.

Nothing was too expensive for the favoured being who dispelled the
Emperor's melancholy, and she had proved how much can be accomplished in
a brief space where there is good will on all sides.

By her orders entirely separate suites of apartments had been prepared
for Barbara and the marquise.  Quijada had selected four of her own
saddle horses for the stable of the little castle, and supplied it with
the necessary servants.  Her steward had been commissioned to provide the
servants wanted in the kitchen, and one of her Netherland officials had
received orders to manage the household of the marquise and her
companion, and in doing so to anticipate Barbara's wishes in the most
attentive manner.  One of her best maids, the worthy and skilful Frau
Lamperi, though she was reluctant to part with her, had been sent to
Prebrunn to serve Barbara as garde-robiere.  The advice that the
Emperor's love should take her own waiting maid also came from her.  She
knew the value, amid new circumstances, of a person long known and
trusted.  The idea that Barbara would take her own maid with her rested,
it is true, on the supposition that so well-dressed a young lady, who
belonged to an ancient family, must as surely possess such a person as
eyes and hands.

Barbara had just induced Frau Lerch to accompany her to Prebrunn.  The
old woman's opposition had only been intended to extort more favourable
