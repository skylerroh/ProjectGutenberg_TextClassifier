Of mine affliction, and the eternal hate,
Beyond all lands, chosen and lifted great
For Troy! Vain, vain were prayer and incense-swell
And bulls' blood on the altars!... All is well.
Had He not turned us in His hand, and thrust
Our high things low and shook our hills as dust,
We had not been this splendour, and our wrong
An everlasting music for the song
Of earth and heaven!

     Go, women: lay our dead
In his low sepulchre. He hath his meed
Of robing. And, methinks, but little care
Toucheth the tomb, if they that moulder there
Have rich encerement. 'Tis we, 'tis we,
That dream, we living and our vanity!

[_The Women bear out the dead Child upon the shield, singing, when
presently flames of fire and dim forms are seen among the ruins of the
City_.

CHORUS.
_Some Women_.

Woe for the mother that bare thee, child,
  Thread so frail of a hope so high,
That Time hath broken: and all men smiled
  About thy cradle, and, passing by,
  Spoke of thy father's majesty.
      Low, low, thou liest!

_Others_.

Ha! Who be these on the crested rock?
Fiery hands in the dusk, and a shock
Of torches flung! What lingereth still,
O wounded City, of unknown ill,
    Ere yet thou diest?

TALTHYBIUS (_coming out through the ruined Wall_).

Ye Captains that have charge to wreck this keep
Of Priam's City, let your torches sleep
No more! Up, fling the fire into her heart!
Then have we done with Ilion, and may part
In joy to Hellas from this evil land.
  And ye--so hath one word two faces--stand,
Daughters of Troy, till on your ruined wall
The echo of my master's trumpet call
In signal breaks: then, forward to the sea,
Where the long ships lie waiting.

     And for thee,
O ancient woman most unfortunate,
Follow: Odysseus' men be here, and wait
To guide thee.... 'Tis to him thou go'st for thrall.

HECUBA.

Ah, me! and is it come, the end of all,
The very crest and summit of my days?
I go forth from my land, and all its ways
Are filled with fire! Bear me, O aged feet,
A little nearer: I must gaze, and greet
My poor town ere she fall.

     Farewell, farewell!
O thou whose breath was mighty on the swell
Of orient winds, my Troy! Even thy name
Shall soon be taken from thee. Lo, the flame
Hath thee, and we, thy children, pass away
To slavery.... God! O God of mercy!... Nay:
Why call I on the Gods? They know, they know,
My prayers, and would not hear them long ago.
  Quick, to the flames! O, in thine agony,
My Troy, mine own, take me to die with thee!

[_She springs toward the flames, but is seized and held by the
Soldiers._

TALTHYBIUS.

Back! Thou art drunken with thy miseries,
Poor woman!--Hold her fast, men, till it please
Odysseus that she come. She was his lot
Chosen from all and portioned. Lose her not!

[_He goes to watch over the burning of the City. The dusk deepens_.

CHORUS.
_Divers Women_.

     Woe, woe, woe!
Thou of the Ages[47], O wherefore fleest thou,
  Lord of the Phrygian, Father that made us?
  'Tis we, thy children; shall no man aid us?
  'Tis we, thy children! Seest thou, seest thou?

_Others_.

 He seeth, only his heart is pitiless;
     And the land dies: yea, she,
She of the Mighty Cities perisheth citiless!
     Troy shall no more be!

_Others_.

Woe, woe, woe!
  Ilion shineth afar!
Fire in the deeps thereof,
Fire in the heights above,
  And crested walls of War!

_Others_.
   As smoke on the wing of heaven
     Climbeth and scattereth,
   Torn of the spear and driven,
     The land crieth for death:
O stormy battlements that red fire hath riven,
     And the sword's angry breath!

[_A new thought comes to_ HECUBA; _she kneels and beats the earth with
her hands_.

HECUBA.

[_Strophe_.

O Earth, Earth of my children; hearken! and O
  mine own,
Ye have hearts and forget not, ye in the darkness
  lying!

LEADER.

Now hast thou found thy prayer[48], crying to them that
  are gone.

HECUBA.

Surely my knees are weary, but I kneel above your
  head;
Hearken, O ye so silent! My hands beat your bed!

LEADER.

    I, I am near thee;
    I kneel to thy dead to hear thee,
Kneel to mine own in the darkness; O husband, hear
  my crying!

HECUBA.

Even as the beasts they drive, even as the loads they
  bear,

LEADER.
(Pain; O pain!)

HECUBA.

We go to the house of bondage. Hear, ye dead, O
  hear!

LEADER.
(Go, and come not again!)

HECUBA.

Priam, mine own Priam,
  Lying so lowly,
Thou in thy nothingness,
Shelterless, comfortless,
See'st thou the thing I am?
Know'st thou my bitter stress?

LEADER.

Nay, thou art naught to him!
Out of the strife there came,
Out of the noise and shame,
Making his eyelids dim,
  Death, the Most Holy!
[_The fire and smoke rise constantly higher_.

HECUBA.

[_Antistrophe_.
O high houses of Gods, beloved streets of my birth,
  Ye have found the way of the sword, the fiery and
     blood-red river!

LEADER.

Fall, and men shall forget you! Ye shall lie in the
  gentle earth.

HECUBA.

The dust as smoke riseth; it spreadeth wide its wing;
It maketh me as a shadow, and my City a vanished
  thing!

LEADER.

  Out on the smoke she goeth,
  And her name no man knoweth;
And the cloud is northward, southward; Troy is gone
  for ever!

[_A great crash is heard, and the Wall is lost in smoke and darkness_.

HECUBA.

Ha! Marked ye? Heard ye? The crash of the
     towers that fall!

LEADER.

     All is gone!

HECUBA.

Wrath in the earth and quaking and a flood that
     sweepeth all,

LEADER.

     And passeth on!
     [_The Greek trumpet sounds_.

HECUBA.

Farewell!--O spirit grey,
  Whatso is coming,
Fail not from under me.
Weak limbs, why tremble ye?
Forth where the new long day
Dawneth to slavery!

CHORUS.

Farewell from parting lips,
Farewell!--Come, I and thou,
Whatso may wait us now,
Forth to the long Greek ships[49]
   And the sea's foaming.

[_The trumpet sounds again, and the Women go out in the darkness._




NOTES ON THE TROJAN WOMEN


[1] Poseidon.]--In the _Iliad_ Poseidon is the enemy of Troy, here the
friend. This sort of confusion comes from the fact that the Trojans and
their Greek enemies were largely of the same blood, with the same tribal
gods. To the Trojans, Athena the War-Goddess was, of course, _their_
War-Goddess, the protectress of their citadel. Poseidon, god of the sea
and its merchandise, and Apollo (possibly a local shepherd god?), were
their natural friends and had actually built their city wall for love of
the good old king, Laomedon. Zeus, the great father, had Mount Ida for
his holy hill and Troy for his peculiar city. (Cf. on p. 63.)

To suit the Greek point of view all this had to be changed or explained
away. In the _Iliad_ generally Athena is the proper War-Goddess of the
Greeks. Poseidon had indeed built the wall for Laomedon, but Laomedon
had cheated him of his reward--as afterwards he cheated Heracles, and
the Argonauts and everybody else! So Poseidon hated Troy. Troy is
chiefly defended by the barbarian Ares, the oriental Aphrodite, by its
own rivers Scamander and Simois and suchlike inferior or unprincipled
gods.

Yet traces of the other tradition remain. Homer knows that Athena is
specially worshipped in Troy. He knows that Apollo, who had built the
wall with Poseidon, and had the same experience of Laomedon, still loves
the Trojans. Zeus himself, though eventually in obedience to destiny he
permits the fall of the city, nevertheless has a great tenderness
towards it.

[2] A steed marvellous.]--See below, on p. 36.

[3] go forth from great Ilion, &c.]--The correct ancient doctrine. When
your gods forsook you, there was no more hope. Conversely, when your
state became desperate, evidently your gods were forsaking you. From
another point of view, also, when the city was desolate and unable to
worship its gods, the gods of that city were no more.

[4] Laotian Tyndarid.]--Helen was the child of Zeus and Leda, and sister
of Castor and Polydeuces; but her human father was Tyndareus, an old
Spartan king. She is treated as "a prisoner and a prize," _i.e_., as a
captured enemy, not as a Greek princess delivered from the Trojans.

[5] In secret slain.]--Because the Greeks were ashamed of the bloody
deed. See below, p. 42, and the scene on this subject in the _Hecuba_.

[6] Cassandra.]--In the _Agamemnon_ the story is more clearly told, that
Cassandra was loved by Apollo and endowed by him with the power of
prophecy; then in some way she rejected or betrayed him, and he set upon
her the curse that though seeing the truth she should never be believed.
The figure of Cassandra in this play is not inconsistent with that
version, but it makes a different impression. She is here a dedicated
virgin, and her mystic love for Apollo does not seem to have suffered
any breach.

[7] Pallas.]--(See above.) The historical explanation of the Trojan
Pallas and the Greek Pallas is simple enough; but as soon as the two are
mythologically personified and made one, there emerges just such a
bitter and ruthless goddess as Euripides, in his revolt against the
current mythology, loved to depict. But it is not only the mythology
that he is attacking. He seems really to feel that if there are
conscious gods ruling the world, they are cruel or "inhuman" beings.

[8]--Ajax the Less, son of Oileus, either ravished or attempted to
ravish Cassandra (the story occurs in both forms) while she was clinging
to the Palladium or image of Pallas. It is one of the great typical sins
of the Sack of Troy, often depicted on vases.

[9] Faces of ships.]--Homeric ships had prows shaped and painted to look
like birds' or beasts' heads. A ship was always a wonderfully live and
vivid thing to the Greek poets. (Cf. p. 64.)

[10] Castor.]--Helen's brother: the Eurotas, the river of her home,
Sparta.

[11] Fifty seeds.]--Priam had fifty children, nineteen of them children
of Hecuba (_Il_. vi. 451, &c.).

[12] Pirene.]--The celebrated spring on the hill of Corinth. Drawing
water was a typical employment of slaves.

[13] ff., Theseus' land, &c.]--Theseus' land is Attica. The poet, in the
midst of his bitterness over the present conduct of his city, clings the
more to its old fame for humanity. The "land high-born" where the Peneues
flows round the base of Mount Olympus in northern Thessaly is one of the
haunts of Euripides' dreams in many plays. Cf. _Bacchae_, 410 (p. 97 in
my translation). Mount Aetna fronts the "Tyrians' citadel," _i.e._.,
Carthage, built by the Phoenicians. The "sister land" is the district of
Sybaris in South Italy, where the river Crathis has, or had, a red-gold
colour, which makes golden the hair of men and the fleeces of sheep; and
the water never lost its freshness.

[14] Talthybius is a loyal soldier with every wish to be kind. But he is
naturally in good spirits over the satisfactory end of the war, and his
tact is not sufficient to enable him to understand the Trojan Women's
feelings. Yet in the end, since he has to see and do the cruelties which
his Chiefs only order from a distance, the real nature of his work
forces itself upon him, and he feels and speaks at times almost like a
Trojan. It is worth noticing how the Trojan Women generally avoid
addressing him. (Cf. pp. 48, 67, 74.)

[15] The haunted keys (literally, "with God through them, penetrating
them").]--Cassandra was his Key-bearer, holding the door of his Holy
Place. (Cf. _ Hip_. 540, p. 30.)

[16] She hath a toil, &c.]--There is something true and pathetic about
this curious blindness which prevents Hecuba from understanding "so
plain a riddle." (Cf. below, p. 42.) She takes the watching of a Tomb to
be some strange Greek custom, and does not seek to have it explained
further.
