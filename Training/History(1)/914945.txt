his own son _meus Cicero_. -- NEMO VIR: see n. on 21 _quemquam senem_. --
QUOD CONTRA: = [Greek: ho tounantion], 'whereas on the contrary'; cf. n. on
Lael. 90 where, as well as here, many of the editors make the mistake of
taking _quod_ to be the accusative governed by _contra_ out of place. --
MEUM: _sc. corpus cremari_. -- QUO: put for _ad quae_, as often. -- VISUS
SUM: 'people thought I bore up bravely'. -- NON QUO ... SED: a relative
clause parallel with a categorically affirmative clause. The usage is not
uncommon, though Cic. often has _non quo ... sed quia_. For mood of
_ferrem_ see A. 341, _d_, Rem.; G. 541, Rem. 1.; H. 516, II. 2.

85. DIXISTI: in 4. -- QUI: here = _cum ego_, 'since I ...'. -- EXTORQUERI
VOLO: n. on 2 _levari volo_. -- MINUTI PHILOSOPHI: for the word _minutus_
cf. n. on 46; Cic. has _minuti philosophi_ in Acad. 2, 75; Div. 1, 62; in
Fin. 1, 61 _minuti et angusti (homines)_; in Brut. 265 _m. imperatores_;
cf. Suet. Aug. 83 _m. pueri_. -- SENTIAM: future indicative. -- PERACTIO:
the noun is said to occur only here in Cic.; cf. however 64 _peragere_; 70.
-- HAEC ... DICEREM: the same words occur at the end of the Laelius; for
_habeo quod dicam_ Cic. often says _habeo dicere_, as in Balb. 34.

[1] Horace, Ep. 2, 1, 156:--

  _Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit, et artes
  Intulit agresti Latio._

[2] De Off. 1, 1 2: _philosophandi scientiam concedens multis_ etc.

[3] To judge rightly of Cicero it must be remembered that he was a
politician only by accident: his whole natural bent was towards literature.

[4] To see the truth of this it is only necessary to refer for example to
the weight given to the opinions of Cicero in the heated political
discussions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

[5] Almost every branch of learning was ranked under the head of
Philosophy. Strabo even claimed that one branch of Philosophy was
Geography.

[6] 2, 3 _interiectus est nuper liber is quem ad nostrum Atticum de
senectute misimus._ No argument can be founded on the words _interiectus
est_, over which the editors have wasted much ingenuity. They simply mean
'there was inserted in the series of my works'.

[7] See 2, 23.

[8] 14, 21, 3; 16, 3, 1; 16, 11, 3.

[9] See Att. 14, 21, 1.

[10] It was certainly not written, as Sommerbrodt assumes, in the intervals
of composing the _De Divinatione_. The words in 2, 7 of that work--_quoniam
de re publica consuli coepti sumus_ etc.--point to the end of September or
beginning of October, 44, when Cicero returned to Rome and began to compose
his Philippic orations.

[11] Sec. 1.

[12] It is perhaps not a mere accident that the prowess of L. Brutus _in
liberanda patria_ is mentioned in Sec. 75. There may be a reference to the
latest Brutus who had freed his country.

[13] In March, 45.

[14] Sec. 12.

[15] Sec. 84.

[16] See p. iii. above.

[17] In the notes exact references will be given to the places in the
original where the other passages mentioned may be found.

[18] Particularly the first book of the _Tusculan Disputations_, the _De
Republica_, and the _Laelius_.

[19] See 4, below.

[20] Sec. 3.

[21] Works on Old Age are said to have been written by Theophrastus and
Demetrius Phalereus, either or both of which Cicero might have used. One
passage in Sec. 67, _facilius in morbos ... tristius curantur_, is supposed by
many to have been imitated from Hippocrates; but the resemblance is
probably accidental. Cf. De Off. 1, 24, 83.

[22] See Sec. 2.

[23] See Att. 16, 11, 3; 16, 3, 1; 14, 21, 3.

[24] Sec. 2.

[25] As Cicero's intention was to set old age in a favorable light, he
slights Aristo Cius for giving to Tithonus the chief part in a dialogue on
old age. See Sec. 3; cf. also Laelius, Sec. 4.

[26] See below (ii.), 1.

[27] On the whole subject of Aristotle's dialogues see Bernays' monograph,
_Die Dialoge des Aristoteles_.

[28] Sec. 32 _quartum ago annum et octogesimum_. Cf. Lael. 11 _memini Catonem
ante quam est mortuus mecum et cum Scipione disserere_ etc.

[29] Cicero always indicates this date; cf. Sec. 14. Some other writers, as
Livy, give, probably wrongly, an earlier date.

[30] He himself says (Festus, p.28l) _ego iam a principio in parsimonia
atque in duritia atque industria omnem adulescentiam, abstinui agro
colendo, saxis Sabinis silicibus repastinandis atque conserendis_. Cf.
Gell. _Noct. Att._ 13, 23.

[31] See Cat. M. 44.

[32] Plut. C. 1; Cat. M. Sec.Sec. 18, 32: Cato himself ap. Fest. s.v.
_ordinarius_ says _quid mihi fieret si non ego stipendia in ordine omnia
ordinarius meruissem semper?_

[33] Sec. 10.

[34] If Plutarch may be trusted, Cato at the age of 30 had won for himself
the title of 'the Roman Demosthenes'.

[35] Sec. 10.

[36] In Sec. 10 Cicero makes the quaestorship fall in 205, but he refers to
the election, not to the actual year of office.

[37] Nepos (or pseudo-Nepos), Cat. 1.

[38] Cato afterwards made it a charge against M. Fulvius Nobilior that he
had taken Ennius with him on a campaign (Tusc. 1, 3). But Cato used Ennius
as soldier while Nobilior employed him as poet.

[39] It is difficult, however, to fix the date of this enactment. Some
authorities place it after Cato's return from Spain.

[40] Livy 34, cc. 1-8.

[41] See Livy, 34, 18.

[42] _i.e._ he was _legatus consularis_. It was at the time a common thing
for ex-consuls to take service under their successors. So Liv. 36, 17, 1,
but Cic. Cat. M. c 10 says _tribunus militaris_.

[43] Cicero's statements throughout the treatise concerning the relations
between Cato and Africanus the elder, particularly in Sec. 77 where Cato calls
his enemy _amicissimus_, are audaciously inexact.

[44] See Cato M. Sec. 42.

[45] We possess the titles of 26 speeches delivered during or concerning
his censorship.

[46] He is said to have undergone 44 prosecutions, and to have been
prosecutor as often.

[47] See Lael. 9; Cat. M. 12 and 84.

[48] Cf. Livy, 39, 40.

[49] The common view is that Cato said nothing of Roman history from
509-266 B.C.

[50] Cf. Cic. pro Arch. 7, 16.

[51] See Coulanges, 'Ancient City', Bk. II. Ch. 4.

[52] See Sec.Sec. 12, 41 etc.

[53] De Or. 2, 170; Fam. 9, 21, 3; Qu. Fr. 2, 3, 3.

[54] In _De Re Publica_ 2, 1 Cicero makes Scipio talk extravagantly of
Cato.

[55] See Introduction to the Laelius, pp. vi, vii.

[56] A. = Allen and Greenough's Grammar, Revised Ed.; G. = Gildersleeve's
Grammar; H. = Harkness's Grammar, Rev. Ed. of 1881. In quoting from the
works of Cicero reference is made to sections, not to chapters.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
