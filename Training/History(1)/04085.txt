THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE

Of all kinds of satire, there is none so entertaining and universally
improving, as that which is introduced, as it were occasionally, in
the course of an interesting story, which brings every incident home
to life, and by representing familiar scenes in an uncommon and amusing
point of view, invests them with all the graces of novelty, while nature
is appealed to in every particular. The reader gratifies his
curiosity in pursuing the adventures of a person in whose favour he
is prepossessed; he espouses his cause, he sympathises with him in his
distress, his indignation is heated against the authors of his calamity:
the humane passions are inflamed; the contrast between dejected
virtue and insulting vice appears with greater aggravation, and every
impression having a double force on the imagination, the memory retains
the circumstance, and the heart improves by the example. The attention
is not tired with a bare catalogue of characters, but agreeably diverted
with all the variety of invention; and the vicissitudes of life appear
in their peculiar circumstances, opening an ample field for wit and
humour.

Romance, no doubt, owes its origin to ignorance, vanity, and
superstition. In the dark ages of the World, when a man had rendered
himself famous for wisdom or valour, his family and adherents availed
themselves of his superior qualities, magnified his virtues, and
represented his character and person as sacred and supernatural. The
vulgar easily swallowed the bait, implored his protection, and yielded
the tribute of homage and praise, even to adoration; his exploits
were handed down to posterity with a thousand exaggerations; they were
repeated as incitements to virtue; divine honours were paid, and altars
erected to his memory, for the encouragement of those who attempted to
imitate his example; and hence arose the heathen mythology, which is no
other than a collection of extravagant romances. As learning advanced,
and genius received cultivation, these stories were embellished with the
graces of poetry, that they might the better recommend themselves to the
attention; they were sung in public, at festivals, for the instruction
and delight of the audience; and rehearsed before battle, as incentives
to deeds of glory. Thus tragedy and the epic muse were born, and, in
the progress of taste, arrived at perfection. It is no wonder that the
ancients could not relish a fable in prose, after they had seen so many
remarkable events celebrated in verse by their best poets; we therefore
find no romance among them during the era of their excellence, unless
the Cyropaedia of Xenophon may be so called; and it was not till arts
and sciences began to revive after the irruption of the barbarians into
Europe, that anything of this kind appeared. But when the minds of men
were debauched by the imposition of priestcraft to the most absurd
pitch of credulity, the authors of romance arose, and losing sight
of probability, filled their performances with the most monstrous
hyperboles. If they could not equal the ancient poets in point of genius
they were resolved to excel them in fiction, and apply to the wonder,
rather than the judgment, of their readers. Accordingly, they brought
necromancy to their aid, and instead of supporting the character of
their heroes by dignity of sentiment and practice, distinguished them by
their bodily strength, activity, and extravagance of behaviour. Although
nothing could be more ludicrous and unnatural than the figures they
drew, they did not want patrons and admirers; and the world actually
began to be infected with the spirit of knight-errantry, when Cervantes,
by an inimitable piece of ridicule, reformed the taste of mankind,
representing chivalry in the right point of view, and converting romance
to purposes far more useful and entertaining, by making it assume the
sock, and point out the follies of ordinary life.

The same method has been practised by other Spanish and French authors,
and by none more successfully than by Monsieur Le Sage, who, in his
Adventures of Gil Blas, has described the knavery and foibles of life,
with infinite humour and sagacity. The following sheets I have modelled
on his plan, taking me liberty, however, to differ from him in the
execution, where I thought his particular situations were uncommon,
extravagant, or peculiar to the country in which the scene is laid.
The disgraces of Gil Blas are, for the most part, such as rather excite
mirth than compassion; he himself laughs at them; and his transitions
from distress to happiness, or at least ease, are so sudden, that
neither the reader has time to pity him, nor himself to be acquainted
with affliction. This conduct, in my opinion, not only deviates from
probability, but prevents that generous indignation, which ought to
animate the reader against the sordid and vicious disposition of the
world. I have attempted to represent modest merit struggling with every
difficulty to which a friendless orphan is exposed, from his own want
of experience, as well as from the selfishness, envy, malice, and base
indifference of mankind. To secure a favourable prepossession, I have
allowed him the advantages of birth and education, which in the series
of his misfortunes will, I hope, engage the ingenuous more warmly in his
behalf; and though I foresee, that some people will be offended at
the mean scenes in which he is involved, I persuade myself that the
judicious will not only perceive the necessity of describing those
situations to which he must of course be confined, in his low estate,
but also find entertainment in viewing those parts of life, where
the humours and passions are undisguised by affectation, ceremony, or
education; and the whimsical peculiarities of disposition appear as
nature has implanted them. But I believe I need not trouble myself in
vindicating a practice authorized by the best writers in this way, some
of whom I have already named.

Every intelligent reader will, at first sight, perceive I have not
deviated from nature in the facts, which are all true in the main,
although the circumstances are altered and disguised, to avoid personal
satire.

It now remains to give my reasons for making the chief personage of
this work a North Briton, which are chiefly these: I could, at a small
expense, bestow on him such education as I thought the dignity of his
birth and character required, which could not possibly be obtained in
England, by such slender means as the nature of my plan would afford.
lit the next place, I could represent simplicity of manners in a remote
part of the kingdom, with more propriety than in any place near
the capital; and lastly, the disposition of the Scots, addicted to
travelling, justifies my conduct in deriving an adventurer from that
country. That the delicate reader may not be offended at the unmeaning
oaths which proceed from the mouths of some persons in these memoirs,
I beg leave to promise, that I imagined nothing could more effectually
expose the absurdity of such miserable expletives, than a natural and
verbal representation of the discourse in which they occur.






APOLOGUE

A young painter, indulging a vein of pleasantry, sketched a kind of
conversation piece, representing a bear, an owl, a monkey, and an ass;
and to render it more striking, humorous, and moral, distinguished every
figure by some emblem of human life. Bruin was exhibited in the garb and
attitude of an old, toothless, drunken soldier; the owl perched upon the
handle of a coffee-pot, with spectacle on nose, seemed to contemplate a
newspaper; and the ass, ornamented with a huge tie-wig (which, however,
could not conceal his long ears), sat for his picture to the monkey, who
appeared with the implements of painting. This whimsical group afforded
some mirth, and met with general approbation, until some mischievous wag
hinted that the whole--was a lampoon upon the friends of the performer;
an insinuation which was no sooner circulated than those very people who
applauded it before began to be alarmed, and even to fancy themselves
signified by the several figures of the piece.

Among others, a worthy personage in years, who had served in the army
with reputation, being incensed at the Supposed outrage, repaired to the
lodging of the painter, and finding him at home, "Hark ye, Mr. Monkey,"
said he, "I have a good mind to convince you, that though the bear has
lost his teeth, he retains his paws, and that he is not so drunk but he
can perceive your impertinence." "Sblood! sir, that toothless jaw is a
d--ned scandalous libel--but don't you imagine me so chopfallen as not
to be able to chew the cud of resentment." Here he was interrupted by
the arrival of a learned physician, who, advancing to the culprit with
fury in his aspect, exclaimed, "Suppose the augmentation of the ass's
ears should prove the diminution of the baboon's--nay, seek not to
prevaricate, for, by the beard of Aesculapius! there is not one hair
in this periwig that will not stand up in judgment to convict thee of
personal abuse. Do but observe, captain, how this pitiful little fellow
has copied the very curls--the colour, indeed, is different, but then
the form and foretop are quite similar." While he thus remonstrated in a
strain of vociferation, a venerable senator entered, and waddling up to
the delinquent, "Jackanapes!" cried he, "I will now let thee see I
can read something else than a newspaper, and that without the help of
spectacles: here is your own note of hand, sirrah, for money, which if
I had not advanced, you yourself would have resembled an owl, in not
daring to show your face by day, you ungrateful slanderous knave!"

In vain the astonished painter declared that he had no intention to
give offence, or to characterise particular persons: they affirmed
the resemblance was too palpable to be overlooked; they taxed him with
insolence, malice, and ingratitude; and their clamours being overheard
by the public, the captain was a bear, the doctor an ass, and the
senator an owl, to his dying day.

Christian reader, I beseech thee, in the bowels of the Lord, remember
this example "while thou art employed in the perusal of the following
sheets; and seek not to appropriate to thyself that which equally
belongs to five hundred different people. If thou shouldst meet with a
character that reflects thee in some ungracious particular, keep thy
own counsel; consider that one feature makes not a face, and that
though thou art, perhaps, distinguished by a bottle nose, twenty of thy
neighbours may be in the same predicament."






THE ADVENTURES OF RODERICK RANDOM




CHAPTER I

Of my Birth and Education

I was born in the northern part of this united kingdom, in the house of
my grandfather, a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence, who
had on many occasions signalised himself in behalf of his country; and
was remarkable for his abilities in the law, which he exercised with
great success in the station of a judge, particularly against beggars,
for whom he had a singular aversion.

My father (his youngest son) falling in love with a poor relation, who
lived with the old gentleman in quality of a housekeeper, espoused
her privately; and I was the first fruit of that marriage. During her
pregnancy, a dream discomposed my mother so much that her husband,
tired with her importunity, at last consulted a highland seer, whose
favourable interpretation he would have secured beforehand by a
bribe, but found him incorruptible. She dreamed she was delivered of a
tennis-ball, which the devil (who, to her great surprise, acted the part
of a midwife) struck so forcibly with a racket that it disappeared in
an instant; and she was for some time inconsolable for the lost of
her offspring; when, all on a sudden, she beheld it return with equal
violence, and enter the earth, beneath her feet, whence immediately
sprang up a goodly tree covered with blossoms, the scent of which
operated so strongly on her nerves that she awoke. The attentive sage,
after some deliberation, assured my parents, that their firstborn
would be a great traveller; that he would undergo many dangers and
difficulties, and at last return to his native land, where he would
flourish in happiness and reputation. How truly this was foretold will
appear in the sequel. It was not long before some officious person
informed my grandfather of certain familiarities that passed between his
son and housekeeper which alarmed him so much that, a few days after, he
told my father it was high time for him to think of settling; and that
he had provided a match for him, to which he could in justice have no
objections. My father, finding it would be impossible to conceal his
situation much longer, frankly owned what he had done; and excused
himself for not having asked the consent of his father, by saying, he
knew it would have been to no Purpose; and that, had his inclination
been known, my grandfather might have taken such measures as would have
effectually put the gratification of it out of his power: he added, that
no exceptions could be taken to his wife's virtue, birth, beauty,
and good sense, and as for fortune, it was beneath his care. The old
gentleman, who kept all his passions, except one, in excellent order,
heard him to an end with great temper, and then calmly asked, how he
proposed to maintain himself and spouse? He replied, he could be in no
danger of wanting while his father's tenderness remained, which he and
his wife should always cultivate with the utmost veneration; and he
was persuaded his allowance would be suitable to the dignity and
circumstances of his family, and to the provision already made for his
brothers and sisters, who were happily settled under his protection.
"Your brothers and sisters," said my grandfather, "did not think it
beneath them to consult me in an affair of such importance as matrimony;
neither, I suppose, would you have omitted that piece of duty, had you
not some secret fund in reserve; to the comforts of which I leave you,
with a desire that you will this night seek out another habitation for
yourself and wife, whither, in a short time, I will send you an account
of the ex pens I have been at in your education, with a view of
being reimbursed. Sir, you have made the grand tour--you are a polite
gentleman--a very pretty gentleman--I wish you a great deal of joy, and
am your very humble servant."

So saying, he left my father in a situation easily imagined. However,
he did not long hesitate; for, being perfectly well acquainted with his
father's disposition, he did not doubt that he was glad of this pretence
to get rid of him; and his resolves being as invariable as the laws of
the Medes and Persians, he know it would be to no purpose to attempt him
by prayers and entreaties; so without any farther application, he betook
himself, with his disconsolate bedfellow to a farm-house, where an
old servant of his mother dwelt: there they remained some time in
a situation but ill adapted to the elegance of their desires and
tenderness of their love; which nevertheless my father chose to endure,
rather than supplicate an unnatural and inflexible parent but my mother,
foreseeing the inconveniences to which she must have been exposed,
had she been delivered in this place (and her pregnancy was very far
advanced), without communicating her design to her husband, went in
disguise to the house of my grandfather, hoping that her tears and
condition would move him to compassion, and reconcile him to an event
which was now irrecoverably past.

She found means to deceive the servants, and get introduced as an
unfortunate lady, who wanted to complain of some matrimonial grievances,
it being my grandfather's particular province to decide in all cases
of scandal. She was accordingly admitted into his presence, where,
discovering herself, she fell at his feet, and in the most affecting
manner implored his forgiveness; at the same the same time representing
the danger that threatened not only her life, but that of his own
grandchild, which was about to see the light. He told her he was sorry
that the indiscretion of her and his son had compelled him to make a
vow, which put it out of his power to give them any assistance; that he
had already imparted his thoughts on that subject to her husband,
and was surprised that they should disturb his peace with any farther
importunity. This said, he retired.

The violence of my mother's affliction had such an effect on her
constitution that she was immediately seized with the pains of childbed;
and had not an old maidservant, to whom she was very dear, afforded
her pity and assistance, at the hazard of incurring my grandfather's
displeasure, she and the innocent fruit of her womb must have fallen
miserable victims to his rigour and inhumanity. By the friendship
of this poor woman she was carried up to a garret, and immediately
delivered of a man child, the story of whose unfortunate birth he
himself now relates. My father, being informed of what had happened,
flew to the embraces of his darling spouse, and while he loaded his
offspring with paternal embraces, could not forbear shedding a flood
of tears on beholding the dear partner of his heart (for whose ease he
would have sacrificed the treasures of the east) stretched upon a
flock bed, in a miserable apartment, unable to protect her from the
inclemencies of the weather. It is not to be supposed that the old
gentleman was ignorant of what passed, though he affected to know
nothing of the matter, and pretended to be very much surprised, when one
of his grandchildren, by his eldest son deceased, who lived with him
as his heir apparent, acquainted him with the affair; he determined
therefore to observe no medium, but immediately (on the third day after
her delivery) sent her a peremptory order to be gone, and turned off
the servant who had preserved her life. This behaviour so exasperated
my father that he had recourse to the most dreadful imprecations; and on
his bare knees implored that Heaven would renounce him if ever he should
forget or forgive the barbarity of his sire.

The injuries which this unhappy mother received from her removal in such
circumstances, and the want of necessaries where she lodged, together
with her grief and anxiety of mind, soon threw her into a languishing
disorder, which put an end to her life. My father, who loved her
tenderly, was so affected with her death that he remained six weeks
deprived of his senses; during which time, the people where he lodged
carried the infant to the old man who relented so far, on hearing the
melancholy story of his daughter-in-law's death, and the deplorable
condition of his son, as to send the child to nurse, and he ordered my
father to be carried home to his house, where he soon recovered the use
of his reason.

Whether this hardhearted judge felt any remorse for his cruel treatment
of his son and daughter, or (which is more probable) was afraid his
character would suffer in the neighbourhood, he professed great sorrow
for his conduct to my father, whose delirium was succeeded by a profound
melancholy and reserve. At length he disappeared, and, notwithstanding
all imaginable inquiry, could not be heard of; a circumstance which
confirmed most people in the opinion of his having made away with
himself in a fit of despair. How I understood the particulars of my
birth will appear in the course of these memoirs.






CHAPTER II

I grow up--am hated by my Relations--sent to School--neglected by my
Grandfather--maltreated by my Master--seasoned to Adversity--I form
Cabals against the Pedant--am debarred Access to my Grandfather--hunted
by his Heir--I demolish the Teeth of his Tutor

There were not wanting some who suspected my uncles of being concerned
in my father's fate, on the supposition that they would all share in
the patrimony destined for him; and this conjecture was strengthened by
reflecting that in all his calamities they never discovered the least
inclination to serve him; but, on the contrary, by all the artifices in
their power, fed his resentment and supported his resolution of leaving
him to misery and want. But people of judgment treated this insinuation
as an idle chimera; because, had my relations been so wicked as to
consult their interest by committing such an atrocious crime, the
fate of my father would have extended to me too whose life was another
obstacle to their expectation. Meanwhile, I grew apace, and as I
strongly resembled my father, who was the darling of the tenants, I
wanted nothing which their indigent circumstances could afford: but
their favour was a weak resource against the jealous enmity of my
cousins; who the more my infancy promised, conceived the more implacable
hatred against me: and before I was six years of age, had so effectually
blockaded my grandfather that I never saw him but by stealth, when I
sometimes made up to his chair as he sat to view his labourers in the
field: on which occasion he would stroke my head, bid me be a good boy,
and promise to take care of me.

I was soon after sent to school at a village hard by, of which he had
been dictator time out of mind; but as he never paid for my board, nor
supplied me with clothes, books, and other necessaries I required, my
condition was very ragged and contemptible, and the schoolmaster,
who, through fear of my grandfather, taught me gratis, gave himself no
concern about the progress I made under his instruction. In spite of
all these difficulties and disgraces, I became a good proficient in
the Latin tongue; and, as soon as I could write tolerably, pestered my
grandfather with letters to such a degree that he sent for my master,
and chid him severely for bestowing such pains on my education, telling
him that, if ever I should be brought to the gallows for forgery, which
he had taught me to commit, my blood would lie on his head.

The pedant, who dreaded nothing more than the displeasure of his patron,
assured his honour that the boy's ability was more owing to his own
genius and application than to any instruction or encouragement he
received; that, although he could not divest him of the knowledge he had
