"I don't know--Archibius says so."

"Very well.  They are searching for her zealously enough, as you heard,
and she must not be found.  I am glad that she did not set a snare for
the boy.  How a jealous heart leads us astray!  Were she here, I would
grant her anything to make amends for my unjust suspicion of her and
Antony.  And to think that Alexas--but for your interposition he would
have succeeded--meant to send her to the mines!  It is a terrible warning
to be on my guard.  Against whom?  First of all, my own weakness.  This
is a day of recognition.  A noble aim, but on the way the feet bleed, and
the heart--ah!  Charmian, the poor, weak, disappointed heart!"

She sighed heavily, and supported her head on the arm resting upon the
table at her side.  The polished, exquisitely grained surface of thya-
wood was worth a large estate; the gems in the rings and bracelets which
glittered on her hand and arm would have purchased a principality.  This
thought entered her mind and, overpowered by a feeling of angry disgust,
she would fain have cast all the costly rubbish into the sea or the
destroying flames.

She would gladly have been a beggar, content with the barley bread of
Epicurus, she said to herself, if in return she could but have inspired
her son even with the views of the reckless blusterer Antyllus.  Her
worst fears had not pictured Caesarion so weak, so insignificant.  She
could no longer rest upon her cushions; and while, with drooping head,
she gazed backward over the past, the accusing voice in her own breast
cried out that she was reaping what she had sowed.  She had repressed,
curbed the boy's awakening will to secure his obedience; understood how
to prevent any exercise of his ability or efforts in wider circles.

True, it had been done on many a pretext.  Why should not her son taste
the quiet happiness which she had enjoyed in the garden of Epicurus?  And
was not the requirement that whoever is to command must first learn to
obey, based upon old experiences?

But this was a day of reckoning and insight, and for the first time she
found courage to confess that her own burning ambition had marked out the
course of Caesarion's education.  She had not repressed his talents from
cool calculation, but it had been pleasant to her to see him grow up free
from aspirations.  She had granted the dreamer repose without arousing
him.  How often she had rejoiced over the certainty that this son, on
whom Antony, after his victory over the Parthians, had bestowed the title
of Co-Regent, would never rebel against his mother's guardianship!  The
welfare of the state had doubtless been better secured in her trained
hands than in those of an inexperienced boy.  And the proud consciousness
of power!  Her heart swelled.  So long as she lived she would remain
Queen.  To transfer the sovereignty to another, whatever name he might
bear, had seemed to her impossible.  Now she knew how little her son
yearned for lofty things.  Her heart contracted.  The saying "You reap
what you sowed" gave her no peace, and wherever she turned in her past
life she perceived the fruit of the seeds which she had buried in the
ground.  The field was sinking under the burden of the ears of
misfortune.  The harvest was ripe for the reaper; but, ere he raised the
sickle, the owner's claim must be preserved.  Gorgias must hasten the
building of the tomb; the end could not be long deferred.  How to shape
this worthily, if the victor left her no other choice, had just been
pointed out by the son of whom she was ashamed.  His father's noble blood
forbade him to bear the deepest ignominy with the patience his mother had
inculcated.

It had grown late ere she admitted Antony's body-slave, but for her the
business of the night was just commencing.  After he had gone she would
be engaged for hours with the commanders of the army, the fleet, the
fortifications.  The soliciting of allies, too, must be carried on by
means of letters containing the most stirring appeals to the heart.

Eros, Antony's body-slave, appeared.  His kind eyes filled with tears at
the sight of the Queen.  Grief had not lessened the roundness of his
handsome face, but the expression of mischievous, often insolent, gaiety
had given place to a sorrowful droop of the lips, and his fair hair had
begun to turn grey.

Lucilius's information that Cleopatra had consented to make advances to
Antony had seemed like the rising of the sun after a long period of
darkness.  In his eyes, not only his master, but everything else, must
yield to the power of the Queen.  He had heard Antony at Tarsus inveigh
against "the Egyptian serpent," protesting that he would make her pay so
dearly for her questionable conduct towards himself and the cause of
Caesar that the treasure-houses on the Nile should be like an empty wine-
skin; yet, a few hours after, body and soul had been in her toils.  So it
had continued till the battle of Actium.  Now there was nothing more to
lose; but what might not Cleopatra bestow upon his master?  He thought of
the delightful years during which his face had grown so round, and every
day fresh pleasures and spectacles, such as the world would never again
witness, had satiated eye and ear, palate and nostril,--nay, even
curiosity.  If they could be repeated, even in a simpler form, so much
the better.  His main--nay, almost his sole-desire was to release his
lord from this wretched solitude, this horrible misanthropy, so ill
suited to his nature.

Cleopatra had kept him waiting two hours, but he would willingly have
loitered in the anteroom thrice as long if she only determined to follow
his counsel.  It was worth considering, and Eros did not hesitate to give
it.  No one could foresee how Antony would greet Cleopatra herself, so he
proposed that she should send Charmian--not alone, but with her clever
hunch-backed maid, to whom the Imperator himself had given the name
"Aisopion."  He liked Charmian, and could never see the dusky maid
without jesting with her.  If his master could once be induced to show a
cheerful face to others besides himself, Eros, and perceived how much
better it was to laugh than to lapse into sullen reverie and anger, much
would be gained, and Charmian would do the rest, if she brought a loving
message from her royal mistress.

Hitherto Cleopatra had not interrupted him; but when she expressed the
opinion that a slave's nimble tongue would have little power to change
the deep despondency of a man overwhelmed by the most terrible disaster,
Eros waved his short, broad hand, saying:

"I trust your Majesty will pardon the frankness of a man so humble in
degree, but those in high station often permit us to see what they hide
from one another.  Only the loftiest and the lowliest, the gods and the
slaves, behold the great without disguise.  May my ears be cropped if the
Imperator's melancholy and misanthropy are so intense!  All this is a
disguise which pleases him.  You know how, in better days, he enjoyed
appearing as Dionysus, and with what wanton gaiety he played the part of
the god.  Now he is hiding his real, cheerful face behind the mask of
unsocial melancholy, because he thinks the former does not suit this time
of misfortune.  True, he often says things which make your skin creep,
and frequently broods mournfully over his own thoughts.  But this never
lasts long when we are alone.  If I come in with a very funny story, and
he doesn't silence me at once, you can rely on his surpassing it with
a still more comical one.  A short time ago I reminded him of the fishing
party when your Majesty had a diver fasten a salted herring on his hook.
You ought to have heard him laugh, and exclaim what happy days those
were.  The lady Charmian need only remind him of them, and Aisopion spice
the allusion with a jest.  I'll give my nose--true, it's only a small
one, but everybody values that feature most--if they don't persuade him
to leave that horrible crow's nest in the middle of the sea.  They must
remind him of the twins and little Alexander; for when he permits me to
talk about them his brow smooths most speedily.  He still speaks very
often to Lucilius and his other friends of his great plans of forming a
powerful empire in the East, with Alexandria as its principal city.  His
warrior blood is not yet calm.  A short time ago I was even ordered to
sharpen the curved Persian scimitar he likes to wield.  One could not
know what service it might be, he said.  Then he swung his mighty arm.
By the dog!  The grey-haired giant still has the strength of three
youths.  When he is once more with you, among warriors and battle
chargers, all will be well."

"Let us hope so."  replied Cleopatra kindly, and promised to follow his
advice.

When Iras, who had taken Charmian's place, accompanied the Queen to her
chamber after several hours of toil, she found her silent and sad.  Lost
in thought, she accepted her attendant's aid, breaking her silence only
after she had gone to her couch.  "This has been a hard day, Iras," she
said; "it brought nothing save the confirmation of an old saying, perhaps
the most ancient in the world: 'Every one wilt reap only what he sows.
The plant which grows from the seed you place in the earth may be
crushed, but no power in the world will compel the seed to develop
differently or produce fruit unlike what Nature has assigned to it.'
My seed was evil.  This now appears in the time of harvest.  But we will
yet bring a handful of good wheat to the storehouses.  We will provide
for that while there is time.  I will talk with Gorgias early to-morrow
morning.  While we were building, you showed good taste and often
suggested new ideas.  When Gorgias brings the plans for the mausoleum you
shall examine them with me.  You have a right to do so, for, if I am not
mistaken, few will visit the finished structure more frequently than my
Iras."

The girl started up and, raising her hand as if taking a vow, exclaimed:
"Your tomb will vainly wait my visit; your end will be mine also."

"May the gods preserve your youth from it!" replied the Queen in a tone
of grave remonstrance.  "We still live and will do battle."

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
