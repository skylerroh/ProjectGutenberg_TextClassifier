    He set before him, next, a polish'd board                         80
    And basket, and a goblet fill'd with wine
    For his own use, and at his own command.
    Then, all assail'd at once the ready feast,
    And when nor hunger more nor thirst they felt,
    Then came the muse, and roused the bard to sing
    Exploits of men renown'd; it was a song,
    In that day, to the highest heav'n extoll'd.
    He sang of a dispute kindled between
    The son of Peleus, and Laertes'[27] son,
    Both seated at a feast held to the Gods.                          90
    That contest Agamemnon, King of men,
    Between the noblest of Achaia's host
    Hearing, rejoiced; for when in Pytho erst
    He pass'd the marble threshold to consult
    The oracle of Apollo, such dispute
    The voice divine had to his ear announced;
    For then it was that, first, the storm of war
    Came rolling on, ordain'd long time to afflict
    Troy and the Greecians, by the will of Jove.
      So sang the bard illustrious; then his robe                    100
    Of purple dye with both hands o'er his head
    Ulysses drew, behind its ample folds
    Veiling his face, through fear to be observed
    By the Phaeacians weeping at the song;
    And ever as the bard harmonious ceased,
    He wiped his tears, and, drawing from his brows
    The mantle, pour'd libation to the Gods.
    But when the Chiefs (for they delighted heard
    Those sounds) solicited again the bard,
    And he renew'd the strain, then cov'ring close                   110
    His count'nance, as before, Ulysses wept.
    Thus, unperceiv'd by all, the Hero mourn'd,
    Save by Alcinoues; he alone his tears,
    (Beside him seated) mark'd, and his deep sighs
    O'erhearing, the Phaeacians thus bespake.
      Phaeacia's Chiefs and Senators, attend!
    We have regaled sufficient, and the harp
    Heard to satiety, companion sweet
    And seasonable of the festive hour.
    Now go we forth for honourable proof                             120
    Of our address in games of ev'ry kind,
    That this our guest may to his friends report,
    At home arriv'd, that none like us have learn'd
    To leap, to box, to wrestle, and to run.
      So saying, he led them forth, whose steps the guests
    All follow'd, and the herald hanging high
    The sprightly lyre, took by his hand the bard
    Demodocus, whom he the self-same way
    Conducted forth, by which the Chiefs had gone
    Themselves, for that great spectacle prepared.                   130
    They sought the forum; countless swarm'd the throng
    Behind them as they went, and many a youth
    Strong and courageous to the strife arose.
    Upstood Acroneus and Ocyalus,
    Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, after whom
    Anchialus with Anabeesineus
    Arose, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus bold,
    Amphialus and Thoeon. Then arose,
    In aspect dread as homicidal Mars,
    Euryalus, and for his graceful form                              140
    (After Laodamas) distinguish'd most
    Of all Phaeacia's sons, Naubolides.
    Three also from Alcinoues sprung, arose,
    Laodamas, his eldest; Halius, next,
    His second-born; and godlike Clytoneus.
    Of these, some started for the runner's prize.
    They gave the race its limits.[28] All at once
    Along the dusty champaign swift they flew.
    But Clytoneus, illustrious youth, outstripp'd
    All competition; far as mules surpass                            150
    Slow oxen furrowing the fallow ground,
    So far before all others he arrived
    Victorious, where the throng'd spectators stood.
    Some tried the wrestler's toil severe, in which
    Euryalus superior proved to all.
    In the long leap Amphialus prevail'd;
    Elatreus most successful hurled the quoit,
    And at the cestus,[29] last, the noble son
    Of Scheria's King, Laodamas excell'd.
    When thus with contemplation of the games                        160
    All had been gratified, Alcinoues' son
    Laodamas, arising, then address'd.
      Friends! ask we now the stranger, if he boast
    Proficiency in aught. His figure seems
    Not ill; in thighs, and legs, and arms he shews
    Much strength, and in his brawny neck; nor youth
    Hath left him yet, though batter'd he appears
    With num'rous troubles, and misfortune-flaw'd.
    Nor know I hardships in the world so sure
    To break the strongest down, as those by sea.                    170
      Then answer thus Euryalus return'd.
    Thou hast well said, Laodamas; thyself
    Approaching, speak to him, and call him forth.
      Which when Alcinoues' noble offspring heard,
    Advancing from his seat, amid them all
    He stood, and to Ulysses thus began.
      Stand forth, oh guest, thou also; prove thy skill
    (If any such thou hast) in games like ours,
    Which, likeliest, thou hast learn'd; for greater praise
    Hath no man, while he lives, than that he know                   180
    His feet to exercise and hands aright.
    Come then; make trial; scatter wide thy cares,
    We will not hold thee long; the ship is launch'd
    Already, and the crew stand all prepared.
      To whom replied the wily Chief renown'd
    Wherefore, as in derision, have ye call'd
    Me forth, Laodamas, to these exploits?
    No games have I, but many a grief, at heart,
    And with far other struggles worn, here sit
    Desirous only of conveyance home,                                190
    For which both King and people I implore.
      Then him Euryalus aloud reproach'd.
    I well believ'd it, friend! in thee the guise
    I see not of a man expert in feats
    Athletic, of which various are perform'd
    In ev'ry land; thou rather seem'st with ships
    Familiar; one, accustom'd to controul
    Some crew of trading mariners; well-learn'd
    In stowage, pilotage, and wealth acquired
    By rapine, but of no gymnastic pow'rs.                           200
      To whom Ulysses, frowning dark, replied.
    Thou hast ill spoken, sir, and like a man
    Regardless whom he wrongs. Therefore the Gods
    Give not endowments graceful in each kind,
    Of body, mind, and utt'rance, all to one.
    This man in figure less excels, yet Jove
    Crowns him with eloquence; his hearers charm'd
    Behold him, while with modest confidence
    He bears the prize of fluent speech from all,
    And in the streets is gazed on as a God!                         210
    Another, in his form the Pow'rs above
    Resembles, but no grace around his words
    Twines itself elegant. So, thou in form
    Hast excellence to boast; a God, employ'd
    To make a master-piece in human shape,
    Could but produce proportions such as thine;
    Yet hast thou an untutor'd intellect.
    Thou much hast moved me; thy unhandsome phrase
    Hath roused my wrath; I am not, as thou say'st,
    A novice in these sports, but took the lead                      220
    In all, while youth and strength were on my side.
    But I am now in bands of sorrow held,
    And of misfortune, having much endured
    In war, and buffeting the boist'rous waves.
    Yet, though with mis'ry worn, I will essay
    My strength among you; for thy words had teeth
    Whose bite hath pinch'd and pain'd me to the proof.
      He said; and mantled as he was, a quoit
    Upstarting, seized, in bulk and weight all those
    Transcending far, by the Phaeacians used.                         230
    Swiftly he swung, and from his vig'rous hand
    Sent it. Loud sang the stone, and as it flew
    The maritime Phaeacians low inclined
    Their heads beneath it; over all the marks,
    And far beyond them, sped the flying rock.
    Minerva, in a human form, the cast
    Prodigious measur'd, and aloud exclaim'd.
      Stranger! the blind himself might with his hands
    Feel out the 'vantage here. Thy quoit disdains
    Fellowship with a crowd, borne far beyond.                       240
    Fear not a losing game; Phaeacian none
    Will reach thy measure, much less overcast.
      She ceased; Ulysses, hardy Chief, rejoiced
    That in the circus he had found a judge
    So favorable, and with brisker tone,
    As less in wrath, the multitude address'd.
      Young men, reach this, and I will quickly heave
    Another such, or yet a heavier quoit.
    Then, come the man whose courage prompts him forth
    To box, to wrestle with me, or to run;                           250
    For ye have chafed me much, and I decline
    No strife with any here, but challenge all
    Phaeacia, save Laodamas alone.
    He is mine host. Who combats with his friend?
    To call to proof of hardiment the man
    Who entertains him in a foreign land,
    Would but evince the challenger a fool,
    Who, so, would cripple his own interest there.
    As for the rest, I none refuse, scorn none,
    But wish for trial of you, and to match                          260
    In opposition fair my force with yours.
    There is no game athletic in the use
    Of all mankind, too difficult for me;
    I handle well the polish'd bow, and first
    Amid a thousand foes strike whom I mark,
    Although a throng of warriors at my side
    Imbattled, speed their shafts at the same time.
    Of all Achaia's sons who erst at Troy
    Drew bow, the sole who bore the prize from me
    Was Philoctetes; I resign it else                                270
    To none now nourish'd with the fruits of earth.
    Yet mean I no comparison of myself
    With men of antient times, with Hercules,
    Or with Oechalian Eurytus, who, both,
    The Gods themselves in archery defied.
    Soon, therefore, died huge Eurytus, ere yet
    Old age he reach'd; him, angry to be call'd
    To proof of archership, Apollo slew.
    But if ye name the spear, mine flies a length
    By no man's arrow reach'd; I fear no foil                        280
    From the Phaeacians, save in speed alone;
    For I have suffer'd hardships, dash'd and drench'd
    By many a wave, nor had I food on board
    At all times, therefore I am much unstrung.
      He spake; and silent the Phaeacians sat,
    Of whom alone Alcinoues thus replied.
      Since, stranger, not ungraceful is thy speech,
    Who hast but vindicated in our ears
    Thy question'd prowess, angry that this youth
    Reproach'd thee in the presence of us all,                       290
    That no man qualified to give his voice
    In public, might affront thy courage more;
    Now mark me, therefore, that in time to come,
    While feasting with thy children and thy spouse,
    Thou may'st inform the Heroes of thy land
    Even of our proficiency in arts
    By Jove enjoin'd us in our father's days.
    We boast not much the boxer's skill, nor yet
    The wrestler's; but light-footed in the race
    Are we, and navigators well-inform'd.                            300
    Our pleasures are the feast, the harp, the dance,
    Garments for change; the tepid bath; the bed.
    Come, ye Phaeacians, beyond others skill'd
    To tread the circus with harmonious steps,
    Come, play before us; that our guest, arrived
    In his own country, may inform his friends
    How far in seamanship we all excel,
    In running, in the dance, and in the song.
    Haste! bring ye to Demodocus his lyre
    Clear-toned, left somewhere in our hall at home.                 310
      So spake the godlike King, at whose command
    The herald to the palace quick return'd
    To seek the charming lyre. Meantime arose
    Nine arbiters, appointed to intend
    The whole arrangement of the public games,
    To smooth the circus floor, and give the ring
    Its compass, widening the attentive throng.
    Ere long the herald came, bearing the harp,
    With which Demodocus supplied, advanced
    Into the middle area, around whom                                320
    Stood blooming youths, all skilful in the dance.
    With footsteps justly timed all smote at once
    The sacred floor; Ulysses wonder-fixt,
    The ceaseless play of twinkling[30] feet admired.
      Then, tuning his sweet chords, Demodocus
    A jocund strain began, his theme, the loves
    Of Mars and Cytherea chaplet-crown'd;
    How first, clandestine, they embraced beneath
    The roof of Vulcan, her, by many a gift
    Seduced, Mars won, and with adult'rous lust                      330
    The bed dishonour'd of the King of fire.
    The sun, a witness of their amorous sport,
    Bore swift the tale to Vulcan; he, apprized
    Of that foul deed, at once his smithy sought,
    In secret darkness of his inmost soul
    Contriving vengeance; to the stock he heav'd
    His anvil huge, on which he forged a snare
    Of bands indissoluble, by no art
    To be untied, durance for ever firm.
    The net prepared, he bore it, fiery-wroth,                       340
    To his own chamber and his nuptial couch,
    Where, stretching them from post to post, he wrapp'd
    With those fine meshes all his bed around,
    And hung them num'rous from the roof, diffused
    Like spiders' filaments, which not the Gods
    Themselves could see, so subtle were the toils.
    When thus he had encircled all his bed
    On ev'ry side, he feign'd a journey thence
    To Lemnos, of all cities that adorn
    The earth, the city that he favours most.                        350
    Nor kept the God of the resplendent reins
    Mars, drowsy watch, but seeing that the famed
    Artificer of heav'n had left his home,
    Flew to the house of Vulcan, hot to enjoy
    The Goddess with the wreath-encircled brows.
    She, newly from her potent Sire return'd
    The son of Saturn, sat. Mars, ent'ring, seiz'd
    Her hand, hung on it, and thus urg'd his suit.
      To bed, my fair, and let us love! for lo!
    Thine husband is from home, to Lemnos gone,                      360
    And to the Sintians, men of barb'rous speech.
      He spake, nor she was loth, but bedward too
    Like him inclined; so then, to bed they went,
    And as they lay'd them down, down stream'd the net
    Around them, labour exquisite of hands
    By ingenuity divine inform'd.
    Small room they found, so prison'd; not a limb
    Could either lift, or move, but felt at once
    Entanglement from which was no escape.
    And now the glorious artist, ere he yet                          370
    Had reach'd the Lemnian isle, limping, return'd
    From his feign'd journey, for his spy the sun
    Had told him all. With aching heart he sought
    His home, and, standing in the vestibule,
    Frantic with indignation roar'd to heav'n,
    And roar'd again, summoning all the Gods.--
    Oh Jove! and all ye Pow'rs for ever blest!
    Here; hither look, that ye may view a sight
    Ludicrous, yet too monstrous to be borne,
    How Venus always with dishonour loads                            380
    Her cripple spouse, doating on fiery Mars!
    And wherefore? for that he is fair in form
    And sound of foot, I ricket-boned and weak.
    Whose fault is this? Their fault, and theirs alone
    Who gave me being; ill-employ'd were they
    Begetting me, one, better far unborn.
    See where they couch together on my bed
    Lascivious! ah, sight hateful to my eyes!
    Yet cooler wishes will they feel, I ween,
    To press my bed hereafter; here to sleep                         390
    Will little please them, fondly as they love.
    But these my toils and tangles will suffice
    To hold them here, till Jove shall yield me back
    Complete, the sum of all my nuptial gifts
    Paid to him for the shameless strumpet's sake
    His daughter, as incontinent as fair.
      He said, and in the brazen-floor'd abode
    Of Jove the Gods assembled. Neptune came
    Earth-circling Pow'r; came Hermes friend of man,
    And, regent of the far-commanding bow,                           400
    Apollo also came; but chaste reserve
    Bashful kept all the Goddesses at home.
    The Gods, by whose beneficence all live,
    Stood in the portal; infinite arose
    The laugh of heav'n, all looking down intent
    On that shrewd project of the smith divine,
    And, turning to each other, thus they said.
      Bad works speed ill. The slow o'ertakes the swift.
    So Vulcan, tardy as he is, by craft
    Hath outstript Mars, although the fleetest far                   410
    Of all who dwell in heav'n, and the light-heel'd
    Must pay the adult'rer's forfeit to the lame.
      So spake the Pow'rs immortal; then the King
    Of radiant shafts thus question'd Mercury.
      Jove's son, heaven's herald, Hermes, bounteous God!
    Would'st _thou_ such stricture close of bands endure
    For golden Venus lying at thy side?
      Whom answer'd thus the messenger of heav'n
    Archer divine! yea, and with all my heart;
    And be the bands which wind us round about                       420
    Thrice these innumerable, and let all
    The Gods and Goddesses in heav'n look on,
    So I may clasp Vulcan's fair spouse the while.
      He spake; then laugh'd the Immortal Pow'rs again.
    But not so Neptune; he with earnest suit
    The glorious artist urged to the release
    Of Mars, and thus in accents wing'd he said.
      Loose him; accept my promise; he shall pay
    Full recompense in presence of us all.
      Then thus the limping smith far-famed replied.                 430
    Earth-circler Neptune, spare me that request.
    Lame suitor, lame security.[31] What bands
    Could I devise for thee among the Gods,
    Should Mars, emancipated once, escape,
    Leaving both debt and durance, far behind?
      Him answer'd then the Shaker of the shores.
    I tell thee, Vulcan, that if Mars by flight
    Shun payment, I will pay, myself, the fine.
      To whom the glorious artist of the skies.
    Thou must not, canst not, shalt not be refused.                  440
      So saying, the might of Vulcan loos'd the snare,
    And they, detain'd by those coercive bands
    No longer, from the couch upstarting, flew,
    Mars into Thrace, and to her Paphian home
    The Queen of smiles, where deep in myrtle groves
    Her incense-breathing altar stands embow'r'd.
    Her there, the Graces laved, and oils diffused
    O'er all her form, ambrosial, such as add
    Fresh beauty to the Gods for ever young,
    And cloath'd her in the loveliest robes of heav'n.               450
      Such was the theme of the illustrious bard.
    Ulysses with delight that song, and all
    The maritime Phaeacian concourse heard.
      Alcinoues, then, (for in the dance they pass'd
    All others) call'd his sons to dance alone,
    Halius and Laodamas; they gave
    The purple ball into their hands, the work
    Exact of Polybus; one, re-supine,
    Upcast it high toward the dusky clouds,
    The other, springing into air, with ease                         460
    Received it, ere he sank to earth again.
    When thus they oft had sported with the ball
    Thrown upward, next, with nimble interchange
    They pass'd it to each other many a time,
    Footing the plain, while ev'ry youth of all
    The circus clapp'd his hands, and from beneath
    The din of stamping feet fill'd all the air.
      Then, turning to Alcinoues, thus the wise
    Ulysses spake: Alcinoues! mighty King!
    Illustrious above all Phaeacia's sons!                            470
    Incomparable are ye in the dance,
    Ev'n as thou said'st. Amazement-fixt I stand!
      So he, whom hearing, the imperial might
    Exulted of Alcinoues, and aloud
    To his oar-skill'd Phaeacians thus he spake.
      Phaeacian Chiefs and Senators, attend!
    Wisdom beyond the common stint I mark
    In this our guest; good cause in my account,
    For which we should present him with a pledge
    Of hospitality and love. The Chiefs                              480
    Are twelve, who, highest in command, controul
    The people, and the thirteenth Chief am I.
    Bring each a golden talent, with a vest
    Well-bleach'd, and tunic; gratified with these,
    The stranger to our banquet shall repair
    Exulting; bring them all without delay;
    And let Euryalus by word and gift
    Appease him, for his speech was unadvised.
      He ceas'd, whom all applauded, and at once
    Each sent his herald forth to bring the gifts,                   490
    When thus Euryalus his Sire address'd.
      Alcinoues! o'er Phaeacia's sons supreme!
    I will appease our guest, as thou command'st.
    This sword shall be his own, the blade all steel.
    The hilt of silver, and the unsullied sheath
    Of iv'ry recent from the carver's hand,
    A gift like this he shall not need despise.
      So saying, his silver-studded sword he gave
    Into his grasp, and, courteous, thus began.
      Hail, honour'd stranger! and if word of mine                   500
    Have harm'd thee, rashly spoken, let the winds
    Bear all remembrance of it swift away!
    May the Gods give thee to behold again
    Thy wife, and to attain thy native shore,
    Whence absent long, thou hast so much endured!
      To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.
    Hail also thou, and may the Gods, my friend,
    Grant thee felicity, and may never want
    Of this thy sword touch thee in time to come,
    By whose kind phrase appeas'd my wrath subsides!                 510
      He ended, and athwart his shoulders threw
    The weapon bright emboss'd. Now sank the sun,
    And those rich gifts arrived, which to the house
    Of King Alcinoues the heralds bore.
    Alcinoues' sons receiv'd them, and beside
    Their royal mother placed the precious charge.
    The King then led the way, at whose abode
    Arrived, again they press'd their lofty thrones,
    And to Areta thus the monarch spake.
      Haste, bring a coffer; bring thy best, and store               520
    A mantle and a sumptuous vest within;
    Warm for him, next, a brazen bath, by which
    Refresh'd, and viewing in fair order placed
    The noble gifts by the Phaeacian Lords
    Conferr'd on him, he may the more enjoy
    Our banquet, and the bard's harmonious song.
    I give him also this my golden cup
    Splendid, elaborate; that, while he lives
    What time he pours libation forth to Jove
    And all the Gods, he may remember me.                            530
      He ended, at whose words Areta bade
    Her maidens with dispatch place o'er the fire
    A tripod ample-womb'd; obedient they
    Advanced a laver to the glowing hearth,
    Water infused, and kindled wood beneath
    The flames encircling bright the bellied vase,
    Warm'd soon the flood within. Meantime, the Queen
    Producing from her chamber-stores a chest
    All-elegant, within it placed the gold,
    And raiment, gifts of the Phaeacian Chiefs,                       540
    With her own gifts, the mantle and the vest,
    And in wing'd accents to Ulysses said.
      Now take, thyself, the coffer's lid in charge;
    Girdle it quickly with a cord, lest loss
    Befall thee on thy way, while thou perchance
    Shalt sleep secure on board the sable bark.
      Which when Ulysses heard, Hero renown'd,
    Adjusting close the lid, he cast a cord
    Around it which with many a mazy knot
    He tied, by Circe taught him long before.                        550
    And now, the mistress of the household charge
    Summon'd him to his bath; glad he beheld
    The steaming vase, uncustom'd to its use
    E'er since his voyage from the isle of fair
    Calypso, although, while a guest with her,
    Ever familiar with it, as a God.
    Laved by attendant damsels, and with oil
    Refresh'd, he put his sumptuous tunic on
    And mantle, and proceeding from the bath
    To the symposium, join'd the num'rous guests;                    560
    But, as he pass'd, the Princess all divine
    Beside the pillars of the portal, lost
    In admiration of his graceful form,
    Stood, and in accents wing'd him thus address'd.
      Hail, stranger! at thy native home arrived
    Remember me, thy first deliv'rer here.
      To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.
    Nausicaa! daughter of the noble King
    Alcinoues! So may Jove, high-thund'ring mate
    Of Juno, grant me to behold again                                570
    My native land, and my delightful home,
    As, even there, I will present my vows
    To thee, adoring thee as I adore
    The Gods themselves, virgin, by whom I live!
      He said, and on his throne beside the King
    Alcinoues sat. And now they portion'd out
    The feast to all, and charg'd the cups with wine,
    And introducing by his hand the bard
    Phaeacia's glory, at the column's side
    The herald placed Demodocus again.                               580
      Then, carving forth a portion from the loins
    Of a huge brawn, of which uneaten still
    Large part and delicate remain'd, thus spake
    Ulysses--Herald! bear it to the bard
    For his regale, whom I will soon embrace
    In spite of sorrow; for respect is due
    And veneration to the sacred bard
    From all mankind, for that the muse inspires
    Herself his song, and loves the tuneful tribe.
      He ended, and the herald bore his charge                       590
    To the old hero who with joy received
    That meed of honour at the bearer's hand.
    Then, all, at once, assail'd the ready feast,
    And hunger now, and thirst both satisfied,
    Thus to Demodocus Ulysses spake.
      Demodocus! I give thee praise above
    All mortals, for that either thee the muse
    Jove's daughter teaches, or the King, himself,
    Apollo; since thou so record'st the fate,
    With such clear method, of Achaia's host,                        600
    Their deeds heroic, and their num'rous toils,
    As thou hadst present been thyself, or learnt
    From others present there, the glorious tale.
    Come, then, proceed; that rare invention sing,
    The horse of wood, which by Minerva's aid
    Epeus framed, and which Ulysses erst
    Convey'd into the citadel of Troy
    With warriors fill'd, who lay'd all Ilium waste.
    These things rehearse regular, and myself
    Will, instant, publish in the ears of all                        610
    Thy fame, reporting thee a bard to whom
    Apollo free imparts celestial song.
      He ended; then Apollo with full force
    Rush'd on Demodocus, and he began
    What time the Greeks, first firing their own camp
    Steer'd all their galleys from the shore of Troy.
    Already, in the horse conceal'd, his band
    Around Ulysses sat; for Ilium's sons
    Themselves had drawn it to the citadel.
    And there the mischief stood. Then, strife arose                 620
    Among the Trojans compassing the horse,
    And threefold was the doubt; whether to cleave
    The hollow trunk asunder, or updrawn
    Aloft, to cast it headlong from the rocks,
    Or to permit the enormous image, kept
    Entire, to stand an off'ring to the Gods,
    Which was their destined course; for Fate had fix'd
    Their ruin sure, when once they had received
    Within their walls that engine huge, in which
    Sat all the bravest Greecians with the fate                      630
    Of Ilium charged, and slaughter of her sons.
    He sang, how, from the horse effused, the Greeks
    Left their capacious ambush, and the town
    Made desolate. To others, in his song,
    He gave the praise of wasting all beside,
    But told how, fierce as Mars, Ulysses join'd
    With godlike Menelaus, to the house
    Flew of Deiphobus; him there engaged
    In direst fight he sang, and through the aid
    Of glorious Pallas, conqu'ror over all.                          640
      So sang the bard illustrious, at whose song
    Ulysses melted, and tear after tear
    Fell on his cheeks. As when a woman weeps,
    Her husband, who hath fallen in defence
    Of his own city and his babes before
    The gates; she, sinking, folds him in her arms
    And, gazing on him as he pants and dies,
    Shrieks at the sight; meantime, the enemy
    Smiting her shoulders with the spear to toil
    Command her and to bondage far away,                             650
    And her cheek fades with horror at the sound;
    Ulysses, so, from his moist lids let fall,
    The frequent tear. Unnoticed by the rest
    Those drops, but not by King Alcinoues, fell
    Who, seated at his side, his heavy sighs
