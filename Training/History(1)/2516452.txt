  Of sacred Troy, detested Priam still,
  And still his people, mindful of the crime                      35
  Of Paris, who when to his rural hut
  They came, those Goddesses affronting,[1] praise
  And admiration gave to her alone
  Who with vile lusts his preference repaid.
  But when the twelfth ensuing morn arose,                        40
  Apollo, then, the immortals thus address'd.
    Ye Gods, your dealings now injurious seem
  And cruel. Was not Hector wont to burn
  Thighs of fat goats and bullocks at your shrines?
  Whom now, though dead, ye cannot yet endure                     45
  To rescue, that Andromache once more
  Might view him, his own mother, his own son,
  His father and the people, who would soon
  Yield him his just demand, a funeral fire.
  But, oh ye Gods! your pleasure is alone                         50
  To please Achilles, that pernicious chief,
  Who neither right regards, nor owns a mind
  That can relent, but as the lion, urged
  By his own dauntless heart and savage force,
  Invades without remorse the rights of man,                      55
  That he may banquet on his herds and flocks,
  So Peleus' son all pity from his breast
  Hath driven, and shame, man's blessing or his curse.[2]
  For whosoever hath a loss sustain'd
  Still dearer, whether of his brother born                       60
  From the same womb, or even of his son,
  When he hath once bewail'd him, weeps no more,
  For fate itself gives man a patient mind.
  Yet Peleus' son, not so contented, slays
  Illustrious Hector first, then drags his corse                  65
  In cruel triumph at his chariot-wheels
  Around Patroclus' tomb; but neither well
  He acts, nor honorably to himself,
  Who may, perchance, brave though he be, incur
  Our anger, while to gratify revenge                             70
  He pours dishonor thus on senseless clay.
    To whom, incensed, Juno white-arm'd replied.
  And be it so; stand fast this word of thine,
  God of the silver bow! if ye account
  Only such honor to Achilles due                                 75
  As Hector claims; but Hector was by birth
  Mere man, and suckled at a woman's breast.
  Not such Achilles; him a Goddess bore,
  Whom I myself nourish'd, and on my lap
  Fondled, and in due time to Peleus gave                         80
  In marriage, to a chief beloved in heaven
  Peculiarly; ye were yourselves, ye Gods!
  Partakers of the nuptial feast, and thou
  Wast present also with thine harp in hand,
  Thou comrade of the vile! thou faithless ever!                  85
    Then answer thus cloud-gatherer Jove return'd.
  Juno, forbear. Indulge not always wrath
  Against the Gods. They shall not share alike,
  And in the same proportion our regards.
  Yet even Hector was the man in Troy                             90
  Most favor'd by the Gods, and him no less
  I also loved, for punctual were his gifts
  To us; mine altar never miss'd from him
  Libation, or the steam of sacrifice,
  The meed allotted to us from of old.                            95
  But steal him not, since by Achilles' eye
  Unseen ye cannot, who both day and night
  Watches[3] him, as a mother tends her son.
  But call ye Thetis hither, I would give
  The Goddess counsel, that, at Priam's hands                    100
  Accepting gifts, Achilles loose the dead.
    He ceased. Then Iris tempest-wing'd arose.
  Samos between, and Imbrus rock-begirt,
  She plunged into the gloomy flood; loud groan'd
  The briny pool, while sudden down she rush'd,                  105
  As sinks the bull's[4] horn with its leaden weight,
  Death bearing to the raveners of the deep.
  Within her vaulted cave Thetis she found
  By every nymph of Ocean round about
  Encompass'd; she, amid them all, the fate                      110
  Wept of her noble son ordain'd to death
  At fertile Troy, from Phthia far remote.
  Then, Iris, drawing near, her thus address'd.
    Arise, O Thetis! Jove, the author dread
  Of everlasting counsels, calls for thee.                       115
    To whom the Goddess of the silver feet.
  Why calls the mighty Thunderer me? I fear,
  Oppress'd with countless sorrows as I am,
  To mingle with the Gods. Yet I obey--
  No word of his can prove an empty sound.                       120
    So saying, the Goddess took her sable veil
  (Eye ne'er beheld a darker) and began
  Her progress, by the storm-wing'd Iris led.
  On either hand the billows open'd wide
  A pass before them; they, ascending soon                       125
  The shore, updarted swift into the skies.
  They found loud-voiced Saturnian Jove around
  Environ'd by the ever-blessed Gods
  Convened in full assembly; she beside
  Her Father Jove (Pallas retiring) sat.                         130
  Then, Juno, with consolatory speech,
  Presented to her hand a golden cup,
  Of which she drank, then gave it back again,
  And thus the sire of Gods and men began.
    Goddess of ocean, Thetis! thou hast sought                   135
  Olympus, bearing in thy bosom grief
  Never to be assuaged, as well I know.
  Yet shalt thou learn, afflicted as thou art,
  Why I have summon'd thee. Nine days the Gods,
  Concerning Hector's body and thy own                           140
  Brave city-spoiler son, have held dispute,
  And some have urged ofttimes the Argicide
  Keen-sighted Mercury, to steal the dead.
  But I forbade it for Achilles' sake,
  Whom I exalt, the better to insure                             145
  Thy reverence and thy friendship evermore.
  Haste, therefore, seek thy son, and tell him thus,
  The Gods resent it, say (but most of all
  Myself am angry) that he still detains
  Amid his fleet, through fury of revenge,                       150
  Unransom'd Hector; so shall he, at length,
  Through fear of me, perchance, release the slain.
  Myself to generous Priam will, the while,
  Send Iris, who shall bid him to the fleet
  Of Greece, such ransom bearing as may soothe                   155
  Achilles, for redemption of his son.
    So spake the God, nor Thetis not complied.
  Descending swift from the Olympian heights
  She reach'd Achilles' tent. Him there she found
  Groaning disconsolate, while others ran                        160
  To and fro, occupied around a sheep
  New-slaughter'd, large, and of exuberant fleece.
  She, sitting close beside him, softly strok'd
  His cheek, and thus, affectionate, began.
    How long, my son! sorrowing and mourning here,               165
  Wilt thou consume thy soul, nor give one thought
  Either to food or love? Yet love is good,
  And woman grief's best cure; for length of days
  Is not thy doom, but, even now, thy death
  And ruthless destiny are on the wing.                          170
  Mark me,--I come a lieger sent from Jove.
  The Gods, he saith, resent it, but himself
  More deeply than the rest, that thou detain'st
  Amid thy fleet, through fury of revenge,
  Unransom'd Hector. Be advised, accept                          175
  Ransom, and to his friends resign the dead.
    To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift.
  Come then the ransomer, and take him hence;
  If Jove himself command it,--be it so.
    So they, among the ships, conferring sat                     180
  On various themes, the Goddess and her son;
  Meantime Saturnian Jove commanded down
  His swift ambassadress to sacred Troy.
    Hence, rapid Iris! leave the Olympian heights.
  And, finding noble Priam, bid him haste                        185
  Into Achaia's fleet, bearing such gifts
  As may assuage Achilles, and prevail
  To liberate the body of his son.
  Alone, he must; no Trojan of them all
  May company the senior thither, save                           190
  An ancient herald to direct his mules
  And his wheel'd litter, and to bring the dead
  Back into Ilium, whom Achilles slew.
  Let neither fear of death nor other fear
  Trouble him aught, so safe a guard and sure                    195
  We give him; Mercury shall be his guide
  Into Achilles' presence in his tent.
  Nor will himself Achilles slay him there,
  Or even permit his death, but will forbid
  All violence; for he is not unwise                             200
  Nor heedless, no--nor wilful to offend,
  But will his suppliant with much grace receive.[5]
    He ceased; then Iris tempest-wing'd arose,
  Jove's messenger, and, at the gates arrived
  Of Priam, wo and wailing found within.                         205
  Around their father, in the hall, his sons
  Their robes with tears water'd, while them amidst
  The hoary King sat mantled, muffled close,
  And on his venerable head and neck
  Much dust was spread, which, rolling on the earth,             210
  He had shower'd on them with unsparing hands.
  The palace echoed to his daughters' cries,
  And to the cries of matrons calling fresh
  Into remembrance many a valiant chief
  Now stretch'd in dust, by Argive hands destroy'd.              215
  The messenger of Jove at Priam's side
  Standing, with whisper'd accents low his ear
  Saluted, but he trembled at the sound.
    Courage, Dardanian Priam! fear thou nought;
  To thee no prophetess of ill, I come;                          220
  But with kind purpose: Jove's ambassadress
  Am I, who though remote, yet entertains
  Much pity, and much tender care for thee.
  Olympian Jove commands thee to redeem
  The noble Hector, with an offering large                       225
  Of gifts that may Achilles' wrath appease.
  Alone, thou must; no Trojan of them all
  Hath leave to attend thy journey thither, save
  An ancient herald to direct thy mules
  And thy wheel'd litter, and to bring the dead                  230
  Back into Ilium, whom Achilles slew.
  Let neither fear of death nor other fear
  Trouble thee aught, so safe a guard and sure
  He gives thee; Mercury shall be thy guide
  Even to Achilles' presence in his tent.                        235
  Nor will himself Achilles slay thee there,
  Or even permit thy death, but will forbid
  All violence; for he is not unwise
  Nor heedless, no--nor wilful to offend,
  But will his suppliant with much grace receive.                240
    So spake the swift ambassadress, and went.
  Then, calling to his sons, he bade them bring
  His litter forth, and bind the coffer on,
  While to his fragrant chamber he repair'd
  Himself, with cedar lined and lofty-roof'd,                    245
  A treasury of wonders into which
  The Queen he summon'd, whom he thus bespake.
    Hecuba! the ambassadress of Jove
  Hath come, who bids me to the Grecian fleet,
  Bearing such presents thither as may soothe                    250
  Achilles, for redemption of my son.
  But say, what seems this enterprise to thee?
  Myself am much inclined to it, I feel
  My courage prompting me amain toward
  The fleet, and into the Achaian camp.                          255
    Then wept the Queen aloud, and thus replied.
  Ah! whither is thy wisdom fled, for which
  Both strangers once, and Trojans honor'd _thee_?
  How canst thou wish to penetrate alone
  The Grecian fleet, and to appear before                        260
  His face, by whom so many valiant sons
  Of thine have fallen? Thou hast an iron heart!
  For should that savage man and faithless once
  Seize and discover thee, no pity expect
  Or reverence at his hands. Come--let us weep                   265
  Together, here sequester'd; for the thread
  Spun for him by his destiny severe
  When he was born, ordain'd our son remote
  From us his parents to be food for hounds
  In that chief's tent. Oh! clinging to his side,                270
  How I could tear him with my teeth! His deeds,
  Disgraceful to my son, then should not want
  Retaliation; for he slew not him
  Skulking, but standing boldly for the wives,
  The daughters fair, and citizens of Troy,                      275
  Guiltless of flight,[6] and of the wish to fly.
    Whom godlike Priam answer'd, ancient King.
  Impede me not who willing am to go,
  Nor be, thyself, a bird of ominous note
  To terrify me under my own roof,                               280
  For thou shalt not prevail. Had mortal man
  Enjoin'd me this attempt, prophet, or priest,
  Or soothsayer, I had pronounced him false
  And fear'd it but the more. But, since I saw
  The Goddess with these eyes, and heard, myself,                285
  The voice divine, I go; that word shall stand;
  And, if my doom be in the fleet of Greece
  To perish, be it so; Achilles' arm
  Shall give me speedy death, and I shall die
  Folding my son, and satisfied with tears.                      290
    So saying, he open'd wide the elegant lids
  Of numerous chests, whence mantles twelve he took
  Of texture beautiful; twelve single cloaks;
  As many carpets, with as many robes,
  To which he added vests, an equal store.                       295
  He also took ten talents forth of gold,
  All weigh'd, two splendid tripods, caldrons four,
  And after these a cup of matchless worth
  Given to him when ambassador in Thrace;
  A noble gift, which yet the hoary King                         300
  Spared not, such fervor of desire he felt
  To loose his son. Then from his portico,
  With angry taunts he drove the gather'd crowds.
    Away! away! ye dregs of earth, away!
  Ye shame of human kind! Have ye no griefs                      305
  At home, that ye come hither troubling _me_?
  Deem ye it little that Saturnian Jove
  Afflicts me thus, and of my very best,
  Best boy deprives me? Ah! ye shall be taught
  Yourselves that loss, far easier to be slain                   310
  By the Achaians now, since he is dead.
  But I, ere yet the city I behold
  Taken and pillaged, with these aged eyes,
  Shall find safe hiding in the shades below.
    He said, and chased them with his staff; they left           315
  In haste the doors, by the old King expell'd.
  Then, chiding them aloud, his sons he call'd,
  Helenus, Paris, noble Agathon,
  Pammon, Antiphonus, and bold in fight
  Polites, Dios of illustrious fame,                             320
  Hippothoues and Deiphobus--all nine
  He call'd, thus issuing, angry, his commands.
    Quick! quick! ye slothful in your father's cause,
  Ye worthless brood! would that in Hector's stead
  Ye all had perish'd in the fleet of Greece!                    325
  Oh altogether wretched! in all Troy
  No man had sons to boast valiant as mine,
  And I have lost them all. Mestor is gone
  The godlike, Troilus the steed-renown'd,
  And Hector, who with other men compared                        330
  Seem'd a Divinity, whom none had deem'd
  From mortal man derived, but from a God.
  These Mars hath taken, and hath left me none
  But scandals of my house, void of all truth,
  Dancers, exact step-measurers,[7] a band                       335
  Of public robbers, thieves of kids and lambs.
  Will ye not bring my litter to the gate
  This moment, and with all this package quick
  Charge it, that we may hence without delay?
    He said, and by his chiding awed, his sons                   340
  Drew forth the royal litter, neat, new-built,
  And following swift the draught, on which they bound
  The coffer; next, they lower'd from the wall
  The sculptured boxen yoke with its two rings;[8]
  And with the yoke its furniture, in length                     345
  Nine cubits; this to the extremest end
  Adjusting of the pole, they cast the ring
  Over the ring-bolt; then, thrice through the yoke
  They drew the brace on both sides, made it fast
  With even knots, and tuck'd[9] the dangling ends.              350
  Producing, next, the glorious ransom-price
  Of Hector's body, on the litter's floor
  They heap'd it all, then yoked the sturdy mules,
  A gift illustrious by the Mysians erst
  Conferr'd on Priam; to the chariot, last,                      355
  They led forth Priam's steeds, which the old King
  (In person serving them) with freshest corn
  Constant supplied; meantime, himself within
  The palace, and his herald, were employ'd
  Girding[10] themselves, to go; wise each and good.             360
  And now came mournful Hecuba, with wine
  Delicious charged, which in a golden cup
  She brought, that not without libation due
  First made, they might depart. Before the steeds
  Her steps she stay'd, and Priam thus address'd.                365
    Take this, and to the Sire of all perform
  Libation, praying him a safe return
  From hostile hands, since thou art urged to seek
  The Grecian camp, though not by my desire.
  Pray also to Idaean Jove cloud-girt,                            370
  Who oversees all Ilium, that he send
  His messenger or ere thou go, the bird
  His favorite most, surpassing all in strength,
  At thy right hand; him seeing, thou shalt tend
  With better hope toward the fleet of Greece.                   375
  But should loud-thundering Jove his lieger swift
  Withhold, from me far be it to advise
  This journey, howsoe'er thou wish to go.
    To whom the godlike Priam thus replied.
  This exhortation will I not refuse,                            380
  O Queen! for, lifting to the Gods his hands
  In prayer for their compassion, none can err.
    So saying, he bade the maiden o'er the rest,
  Chief in authority, pour on his hands
  Pure water, for the maiden at his side                         385
  With ewer charged and laver, stood prepared.
  He laved his hands; then, taking from the Queen
  The goblet, in his middle area stood
  Pouring libation with his eyes upturn'd
  Heaven-ward devout, and thus his prayer preferr'd.             390
    Jove, great and glorious above all, who rulest,
  On Ida's summit seated, all below!
  Grant me arrived within Achilles' tent
  Kindness to meet and pity, and oh send
  Thy messenger or ere I go, the bird                            395
  Thy favorite most, surpassing all in strength,
  At my right hand, which seeing, I shall tend
  With better hope toward the fleet of Greece.
    He ended, at whose prayer, incontinent,
  Jove sent his eagle, surest of all signs,                      400
  The black-plumed bird voracious, Morphnos[11] named,
  And Percnos.[11] Wide as the well-guarded door
  Of some rich potentate his vans he spread
  On either side; they saw him on the right,
  Skimming the towers of Troy; glad they beheld                  405
  That omen, and all felt their hearts consoled.
    Delay'd not then the hoary King, but quick
  Ascending to his seat, his coursers urged
  Through vestibule and sounding porch abroad.
  The four-wheel'd litter led, drawn by the mules                410
  Which sage Idaeus managed, behind whom
  Went Priam, plying with the scourge his steeds
  Continual through the town, while all his friends,
  Following their sovereign with dejected hearts,
  Lamented him as going to his death.                            415
  But when from Ilium's gate into the plain
  They had descended, then the sons-in-law
  Of Priam, and his sons, to Troy return'd.
  Nor they, now traversing the plain, the note
  Escaped of Jove the Thunderer; he beheld                       420
  Compassionate the venerable King,
  And thus his own son Mercury bespake.
    Mercury! (for above all others thou
  Delightest to associate with mankind
  Familiar, whom thou wilt winning with ease                     425
  To converse free) go thou, and so conduct
  Priam into the Grecian camp, that none
  Of all the numerous Danai may see
  Or mark him, till he reach Achilles' tent.
    He spake, nor the ambassador of heaven                       430
  The Argicide delay'd, but bound in haste
  His undecaying sandals to his feet,
  Golden, divine, which waft him o'er the floods
  Swift as the wind, and o'er the boundless earth.
  He took his rod with which he charms to sleep                  435
  All eyes, and theirs who sleep opens again.
  Arm'd with that rod, forth flew the Argicide.
  At Ilium and the Hellespontic shores
  Arriving sudden, a king's son he seem'd,
  Now clothing first his ruddy cheek with down,                  440
  Which is youth's loveliest season; so disguised,
  His progress he began. They now (the tomb
  Magnificent of Ilus past) beside
  The river stay'd the mules and steeds to drink,
  For twilight dimm'd the fields. Idaeus first                    445
  Perceived him near, and Priam thus bespake.
    Think, son of Dardanus! for we have need
  Of our best thought. I see a warrior. Now,
  Now we shall die; I know it. Turn we quick
  Our steeds to flight; or let us clasp his knees                450
  And his compassion suppliant essay.
    Terror and consternation at that sound
  The mind of Priam felt; erect the hair
  Bristled his limbs, and with amaze he stood
  Motionless. But the God, meantime, approach'd,                 455
  And, seizing ancient Priam's hand, inquired.
    Whither, my father! in the dewy night
  Drivest thou thy mules and steeds, while others sleep?
  And fear'st thou not the fiery host of Greece,
  Thy foes implacable, so nigh at hand?                          460
  Of whom should any, through the shadow dun
  Of flitting night, discern thee bearing forth
  So rich a charge, then what wouldst thou expect?
  Thou art not young thyself, nor with the aid
  Of this thine ancient servant, strong enough                   465
  Force to repulse, should any threaten force.
  But injury fear none or harm from me;
  I rather much from harm by other hands
  Would save thee, thou resemblest so my sire.
    Whom answer'd godlike Priam, hoar with age.                  470
  My son! well spoken. Thou hast judged aright.
  Yet even me some Deity protects
  Thus far; to whom I owe it that I meet
  So seasonably one like thee, in form
  So admirable, and in mind discreet                             475
  As thou art beautiful. Blest parents, thine!
    To whom the messenger of heaven again,
  The Argicide. Oh ancient and revered!
  Thou hast well spoken all. Yet this declare,
  And with sincerity; bear'st thou away                          480
  Into some foreign country, for the sake
  Of safer custody, this precious charge?
  Or, urged by fear, forsake ye all alike
  Troy's sacred towers! since he whom thou hast lost,
  Thy noble son, was of excelling worth                          485
  In arms, and nought inferior to the Greeks.
    Then thus the godlike Priam, hoary King.
  But tell me first who _Thou_ art, and from whom
  Descended, loveliest youth! who hast the fate
  So well of my unhappy son rehearsed?                           490
    To whom the herald Mercury replied.
  Thy questions, venerable sire! proposed
  Concerning noble Hector, are design'd
  To prove me. Him, not seldom, with these eyes
  In man-ennobling fight I have beheld                           495
  Most active; saw him when he thinn'd the Greeks
  With his sharp spear, and drove them to the ships.
  Amazed we stood to notice him; for us,
  Incensed against the ruler of our host,
  Achilles suffer'd not to share the fight.                      500
  I serve Achilles; the same gallant bark
  Brought us, and of the Myrmidons am I,
  Son of Polyctor; wealthy is my sire,
  And such in years as thou; six sons he hath,
  Beside myself the seventh, and (the lots cast                  505
  Among us all) mine sent me to the wars.
  That I have left the ships, seeking the plain,
  The cause is this; the Greeks, at break of day,
  Will compass, arm'd, the city, for they loathe
  To sit inactive, neither can the chiefs                        510
  Restrain the hot impatience of the host.
    Then godlike Priam answer thus return'd.
  If of the band thou be of Peleus' son,
  Achilles, tell me undisguised the truth.
  My son, subsists he still, or hath thy chief                   515
  Limb after limb given him to his dogs?
    Him answer'd then the herald of the skies.
  Oh venerable sir! him neither dogs
  Have eaten yet, nor fowls, but at the ships
  His body, and within Achilles' tent                            520
  Neglected lies. Twelve days he so hath lain;
  Yet neither worm which diets on the brave
  In battle fallen, hath eaten him, or taint
  Invaded. He around Patroclus' tomb
  Drags him indeed pitiless, oft as day                          525
  Reddens the east, yet safe from blemish still
  His corse remains. Thou wouldst, thyself, admire
  Seeing how fresh the dew-drops, as he lies,
  Rest on him, and his blood is cleansed away
  That not a stain is left. Even his wounds                      530
  (For many a wound they gave him) all are closed,
  Such care the blessed Gods have of thy son,
  Dead as he is, whom living much they loved.
    So he; then, glad, the ancient King replied.
  Good is it, oh my son! to yield the Gods                       535
  Their just demands. My boy, while yet he lived,
  Lived not unmindful of the worship due
  To the Olympian powers, who, therefore, him
  Remember, even in the bands of death.
  Come then--this beauteous cup take at my hand--                540
  Be thou my guard, and, if the Gods permit,
  My guide, till to Achilles' tent I come.
    Whom answer'd then the messenger of heaven.
  Sir! thou perceivest me young, and art disposed
  To try my virtue; but it shall not fail.                       545
  Thou bidd'st me at thine hand a gift accept,
  Whereof Achilles knows not; but I fear
  Achilles, and on no account should dare
  Defraud him, lest some evil find me next.
  But thee I would with pleasure hence conduct                   550
  Even to glorious Argos, over sea
  Or over land, nor any, through contempt
  Of such a guard, should dare to do thee wrong.
    So Mercury, and to the chariot seat
  Upspringing, seized at once the lash and reins,                555
  And with fresh vigor mules and steeds inspired.
  Arriving at the foss and towers, they found
  The guard preparing now their evening cheer,
  All whom the Argicide with sudden sleep
  Oppress'd, then oped the gates, thrust back the bars,          560
  And introduced, with all his litter-load
  Of costly gifts, the venerable King.
  But when they reached the tent for Peleus' son
  Raised by the Myrmidons (with trunks of pine
  They built it, lopping smooth the boughs away,                 555
  Then spread with shaggy mowings of the mead
  Its lofty roof, and with a spacious court
  Surrounded it, all fenced with driven stakes;
  One bar alone of pine secured the door,
  Which ask'd three Grecians with united force                   570
  To thrust it to its place, and three again
  To thrust it back, although Achilles oft
  Would heave it to the door himself alone;)
  Then Hermes, benefactor of mankind,
  That bar displacing for the King of Troy,                      575
  Gave entrance to himself and to his gifts
  For Peleus' son design'd, and from the seat
  Alighting, thus his speech to Priam turn'd.
    Oh ancient Priam! an immortal God
  Attends thee; I am Hermes, by command                          580
  Of Jove my father thy appointed guide.
  But I return. I will not, entering here,
  Stand in Achilles' sight; immortal Powers
  May not so unreservedly indulge
  Creatures of mortal kind. But enter thou,                      585
  Embrace his knees, and by his father both
  And by his Goddess mother sue to him,
  And by his son, that his whole heart may melt.
    So Hermes spake, and to the skies again
  Ascended. Then leap'd Priam to the ground,                     590
  Leaving Idaeus; he, the mules and steeds
  Watch'd, while the ancient King into the tent
  Proceeded of Achilles dear to Jove.
  Him there he found, and sitting found apart
  His fellow-warriors, of whom two alone                         595
  Served at his side, Alcimus, branch of Mars
  And brave Automedon; he had himself
  Supp'd newly, and the board stood unremoved.
  Unseen of all huge Priam enter'd, stood
  Near to Achilles, clasp'd his knees, and kiss'd                600
  Those terrible and homicidal hands
  That had destroy'd so many of his sons.
  As when a fugitive for blood the house
  Of some chief enters in a foreign land,
  All gaze, astonish'd at the sudden guest,                      605
  So gazed Achilles seeing Priam there,
  And so stood all astonish'd, each his eyes
  In silence fastening on his fellow's face.
  But Priam kneel'd, and suppliant thus began.
    Think, oh Achilles, semblance of the Gods!                   610
  On thy own father full of days like me,
  And trembling on the gloomy verge of life.[12]
  Some neighbor chief, it may be, even now
  Oppresses him, and there is none at hand,
  No friend to suocor him in his distress.                       615
  Yet, doubtless, hearing that Achilles lives,
  He still rejoices, hoping, day by day,
  That one day he shall see the face again
  Of his own son from distant Troy return'd.
  But me no comfort cheers, whose bravest sons,                  620
  So late the flower of Ilium, all are slain.
  When Greece came hither, I had fifty sons;
  Nineteen were children of one bed, the rest
  Born of my concubines. A numerous house!
  But fiery Mars hath thinn'd it. One I had,                     625
  One, more than all my sons the strength of Troy,
  Whom standing for his country thou hast slain--
  Hector--his body to redeem I come
  Into Achaia's fleet, bringing, myself,
  Ransom inestimable to thy tent.                                630
  Reverence the Gods, Achilles! recollect
  Thy father; for his sake compassion show
  To me more pitiable still, who draw
  Home to my lips (humiliation yet
  Unseen on earth) his hand who slew my son.                     635
    So saying, he waken'd in his soul regret
  Of his own sire; softly he placed his hand
  On Priam's hand, and push'd him gently away.
  Remembrance melted both. Rolling before
  Achilles' feet, Priam his son deplored                         640
  Wide-slaughtering Hector, and Achilles wept
  By turns his father, and by turns his friend
  Patroclus; sounds of sorrow fill'd the tent.
  But when, at length satiate, Achilles felt
  His heart from grief, and all his frame relieved,              645
  Upstarting from his seat, with pity moved
  Of Priam's silver locks and silver beard,
  He raised the ancient father by his hand,
  Whom in wing'd accents kind he thus bespake.
    Wretched indeed! ah what must thou have felt!                650
  How hast thou dared to seek alone the fleet
  Of the Achaians, and his face by whom
  So many of thy valiant sons have fallen?
  Thou hast a heart of iron, terror-proof.
  Come--sit beside me--let us, if we may,                        665
  Great mourners both, bid sorrow sleep awhile.
  There is no profit of our sighs and tears;
  For thus, exempt from care themselves, the Gods
  Ordain man's miserable race to mourn.
  Fast by the threshold of Jove's courts are placed              660
  Two casks, one stored with evil, one with good,
  From which the God dispenses as he wills.
  For whom the glorious Thunderer mingles both,
  He leads a life checker'd with good and ill
  Alternate; but to whom he gives unmixt                         665
  The bitter cup, he makes that man a curse,
  His name becomes a by-word of reproach,
  His strength is hunger-bitten, and he walks
  The blessed earth, unblest, go where he may.
  So was my father Peleus at his birth                           670
  Nobly endow'd with plenty and with wealth
  Distinguish'd by the Gods past all mankind,
  Lord of the Myrmidons, and, though a man,
  Yet match'd from heaven with an immortal bride.
  But even him the Gods afflict, a son                           675
  Refusing him, who might possess his throne
  Hereafter; for myself, his only heir,
  Pass as a dream, and while I live, instead
  Of solacing his age, here sit, before
  Your distant walls, the scourge of thee and thine.             680
  Thee also, ancient Priam, we have heard
  Reported, once possessor of such wealth
  As neither Lesbos, seat of Macar, owns,
  Nor eastern Phrygia, nor yet all the ports
  Of Hellespont, but thou didst pass them all                    685
  In riches, and in number of thy sons.
  But since the Powers of heaven brought on thy land
  This fatal war, battle and deeds of death
  Always surround the city where thou reign'st.
  Cease, therefore, from unprofitable tears,                     690
  Which, ere they raise thy son to life again
  Shall, doubtless, find fresh cause for which to flow.
    To whom the ancient King godlike replied.
  Hero, forbear. No seat is here for me,
  While Hector lies unburied in your camp.                       695
  Loose him, and loose him now, that with these eyes
  I may behold my son; accept a price
  Magnificent, which may'st thou long enjoy,
  And, since my life was precious in thy sight,
  May'st thou revisit safe thy native shore!                     700
    To whom Achilles, lowering, and in wrath.[13]
  Urge me no longer, at a time like this,
  With that harsh note; I am already inclin'd
  To loose him. Thetis, my own mother came
  Herself on that same errand, sent from Jove.                   705
  Priam! I understand thee well. I know
  That, by some God conducted, thou hast reach'd
  Achaia's fleet; for, without aid divine,
  No mortal even in his prime of youth,
  Had dared the attempt; guards vigilant as ours                 710
  He should not easily elude, such gates,
  So massy, should not easily unbar.
  Thou, therefore, vex me not in my distress,
  Lest I abhor to see thee in my tent,
  And, borne beyond all limits, set at nought                    715
  Thee, and thy prayer, and the command of Jove.
    He said; the old King trembled, and obey'd.
  Then sprang Pelides like a lion forth,
  Not sole, but with his two attendant friends
  Alcimus and Automedon the brave,                               720
  For them (Patroclus slain) he honor'd most
  Of all the Myrmidons. They from the yoke
  Released both steeds and mules, then introduced
  And placed the herald of the hoary King.
  They lighten'd next the litter of its charge                   725
  Inestimable, leaving yet behind
  Two mantles and a vest, that, not unveil'd,
  The body might be borne back into Troy.
  Then, calling forth his women, them he bade
  Lave and anoint the body, but apart,                           730
  Lest haply Priam, noticing his son,
  Through stress of grief should give resentment scope,
  And irritate by some affront himself
  To slay him, in despite of Jove's commands.[14]
  They, therefore, laving and anointing first                    735
  The body, cover'd it with cloak and vest;
  Then, Peleus' son disposed it on the bier,
  Lifting it from the ground, and his two friends
  Together heaved it to the royal wain.
  Achilles, last, groaning, his friend invoked.                  740
    Patroclus! should the tidings reach thine ear,
  Although in Ades, that I have released
  The noble Hector at his father's suit,
  Resent it not; no sordid gifts have paid
  His ransom-price, which thou shalt also share.                 745
    So saying, Achilles to his tent return'd,
  And on the splendid couch whence he had risen
  Again reclined, opposite to the seat
  Of Priam, whom the hero thus bespake.
    Priam! at thy request thy son is loosed,                     750
  And lying on his bier; at dawn of day
  Thou shalt both see him and convey him hence
  Thyself to Troy. But take we now repast;
  For even bright-hair'd Niobe her food
  Forgat not, though of children twelve bereft,                  755
  Of daughters six, and of six blooming sons.
  Apollo these struck from his silver bow,
  And those shaft-arm'd Diana, both incensed
  That oft Latona's children and her own
  Numbering, she scorn'd the Goddess who had borne               760
  Two only, while herself had twelve to boast.
  Vain boast! those two sufficed to slay them all.
  Nine days they welter'd in their blood, no man
  Was found to bury them, for Jove had changed
  To stone the people; but themselves, at last,                  765
  The Powers of heaven entomb'd them on the tenth.
  Yet even she, once satisfied with tears,
  Remember'd food; and now the rocks among
  And pathless solitudes of Sipylus,
  The rumor'd cradle of the nymphs who dance                     770
  On Acheloues' banks, although to stone
  Transform'd, she broods her heaven-inflicted woes.
  Come, then, my venerable guest! take we
  Refreshment also; once arrived in Troy
  With thy dear son, thou shalt have time to weep                775
  Sufficient, nor without most weighty cause.
    So spake Achilles, and, upstarting, slew
  A sheep white-fleeced, which his attendants flay'd,
  And busily and with much skill their task
  Administ'ring, first scored the viands well,                   780
  Then pierced them with the spits, and when the roast
  Was finish'd, drew them from the spits again.
  And now, Automedon dispensed around
  The polish'd board bread in neat baskets piled,
  Which done, Achilles portion'd out to each                     785
  His share, and all assail'd the ready feast.
  But when nor hunger more nor thirst they felt,
  Dardanian Priam, wond'ring at his bulk
  And beauty (for he seem'd some God from heaven)
  Gazed on Achilles, while Achilles held                         790
  Not less in admiration of his looks
  Benign, and of his gentle converse wise,
  Gazed on Dardanian Priam, and, at length
  (The eyes of each gratified to the full)
  The ancient King thus to Achilles spake.                       795
    Hero! dismiss us now each to our bed,
  That there at ease reclined, we may enjoy
  Sweet sleep; for never have these eyelids closed
  Since Hector fell and died, but without cease
  I mourn, and nourishing unnumber'd woes,                       800
  Have roll'd me in the ashes of my courts.
  But I have now both tasted food, and given
  Wine to my lips, untasted till with thee.
    So he, and at his word Achilles bade
  His train beneath his portico prepare                          805
  With all dispatch two couches, purple rugs,
  And arras, and warm mantles over all.
  Forth went the women bearing lights, and spread
  A couch for each, when feigning needful fear,[15]
  Achilles thus his speech to Priam turn'd.                      810
    My aged guest beloved; sleep thou without;
  Lest some Achaian chief (for such are wont
  Ofttimes, here sitting, to consult with me)
  Hither repair; of whom should any chance
  To spy thee through the gloom, he would at once                815
  Convey the tale to Agamemnon's ear,
  Whence hindrance might arise, and the release
  Haply of Hector's body be delay'd.
