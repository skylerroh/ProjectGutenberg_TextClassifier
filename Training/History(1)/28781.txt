
Boxhall testified that at Captain Smith's orders he took word of the
ship's position to the wireless operators.

"What position was that?"

"Forty-one forty-six north, fifty fourteen west."

"Was that the last position taken?"

"Yes, the Titanic stood not far from there when she sank."

After that Boxhall went back to the life-boats, where there were many
men and women. He said they had been provided with life-belts.

DISTRESS ROCKETS FIRED

"After that I was on the bridge most of the time sending out distress
signals, trying to attract the attention of boats ahead," he said. "I
sent up distress rockets until I left the ship, to try to attract the
attention of a ship directly ahead. I had seen her lights. She seemed to
be meeting us and was not far away. She got close enough, so she seemed
to me, to read our Morse electric signals."

"Suppose you had a powerful search light on the Titanic, could you not
have thrown a beam on the vessel and have compelled her attention?"

"We might."

H. J. Pitman, the third officer of the ship, was the first witness on
April 23d. By a series of searching questions Senator Fletcher brought
out the fact that when the collision occurred the Titanic was going at
the greatest speed attained during the trip, even though the ship was
entering the Grand Banks and had been advised of the presence of ice.

Frederick Fleet, a sailor and lookout man on the Titanic, followed
Pitman on the stand. Fleet said he had had five or six years' experience
at sea and was lookout on the Oceanic prior to going on the Titanic. He
was in the crow's nest at the time of the collision.

Fleet stated that he had kept a sharp lookout for ice, and testified to
seeing the iceberg and signaling the bridge.

Fleet acknowledged that if he had been aided in his observations by a
good glass he probably could have spied the berg into which the ship
crashed in time to have warned the bridge to avoid it. Major Arthur
Peuchen, of Toronto, a passenger who followed Fleet on the stand, also
testified to the much greater sweep of vision afforded by binoculars
and, as a yachtsman, said he believed the presence of the iceberg might
have been detected in time to escape the collision had the lookout men
been so equipped.


HAD ASKED FOR BINOCULARS

It was made to appear that the blame for being without glasses did
not rest with the lookout men. Fleet said they had asked for them at
Southampton and were told there were none for them. One glass, in a
pinch, would have served in the crow's nest.

The testimony before the committee on April 24th showed that the big
steamship was on the verge of a field of ice twenty or thirty miles
long, if she had not actually entered it, when the accident occurred.

The committee tried to discover whether it would add to human safety if
the ships were fitted with search lights so that at night objects could
be seen at a greater distance. The testimony so far along this line had
been conflicting. Some of the witnesses thought it would be no harm to
try it, but they were all skeptical as to its value, as an iceberg would
not be especially distinguishable because its bulk is mostly below the
surface.

One of the witnesses said that much dependence is not placed upon the
lookout, and that those lookouts who used binoculars constantly found
them detrimental.

Harold G. Lowe, fifth officer of the Titanic, told the committee
his part in the struggle of the survivors for life following the
catastrophe. The details of this struggle have have already been told in
a previous chapter.


AUTHORIZED TO SELL STORY

In great detail Guglielmo Marconi, on April 25th, explained the
operations of his system and told how he had authorized Operator Bride
of the Titanic, and Operator Cottam, of the Carpathia, to sell their
stories of the disaster after they came ashore.

In allowing the operator's to sell their stories, said Mr. Marconi,
there was no question of suppressing or monopolizing the news. He had
done everything he could, he said, to have the country informed as
quickly as possible of the details of the disaster. That was why he was
particularly glad for the narratives of such important witnesses as
the operators to receive publication, regardless of the papers that
published them.

He repeated the testimony of Cottam that every effort had been made to
get legitimate dispatches ashore. The cruiser Chester, he said, had been
answered as fully as possible, though it was not known at the time that
its queries came from the President of the United States. The Salem, he
said, had never got in touch with the Carpathia operator.

Senator Newlands suggested that the telegrams, some signed by the name
of Mr. Sammis and some with the name of Marconi, directing Cottam to
"keep his mouth shut" and hold out for four figures on his story, was
sent only as the Carpathia was entering New York harbor, when there
was no longer need for sending official or private messages from the
rescuing ship. There had been an impression before, he said, that the
messages had been sent to Cottam when the ship was far at sea, when they
might have meant that he was to hold back messages relieving the anxiety
of those on shore.


SAW DISTRESS ROCKETS

Ernest Gill, a donkey engineman on the steamship Californian, was the
first witness on April 26th. He said that Captain Stanley Lord, of the
Californian, refused later to go to the aid of the Titanic, the rockets
from which could be plainly seen. He says the captain was apprised of
these signals, but made no effort to get up steam and go to the rescue.
The Californian was drifting with the floe. So indignant did he become,
said Gill, that he endeavored to recruit a committee of protest from
among the crew, but the men failed him.

Captain Lord entered a sweeping denial of Gill's accusations and read
from the Californian's log to support his contention. Cyril Evans, the
Californian's wireless operator, however, told of hearing much talk
among the crew, who were critical of the captain's course. Gill, he
said, told him he expected to get $500 for his story when the ship
reached Boston.

Evans told of having warned the Titanic only a brief time before the
great vessel crashed into the berg that the sea was crowded with ice.
The Titanic's operators, he said, at the time were working with the
wireless station at Cape Race, and they told him to "shut up" and keep
out. Within a half hour the pride of the sea was crumpled and sinking.

Members of the committee who examined individually the British
sailors and stewards of the Titanic's crew prepared a report of their
investigations for the full committee. This testimony was ordered to be
incorporated in the record of the hearings.

Most of this testimony was but a repetition of experiences similar to
the many already related by those who got away in the life-boats.

On April 27th Captain James H. Moore, of the steamship Mount Temple, who
hurried to the Titanic in response to wireless calls for help, told of
the great stretch of field ice which held him off. Within his view
from the bridge he discerned, he said, a strange steamship, probably
a "tramp," and a schooner which was making her way out of the ice. The
lights of this schooner, he thought, probably were those seen by the
anxious survivors of the Titanic and which they were frantically trying
to reach.


WOMEN AT HEARING WEEP

Steward Crawford also related a thrilling story in regard to loading
the life-boats with women first. He told of several instances that came
under his observation of women throwing their arms around their husbands
and crying out that they would not leave the ship without them. The
pathetic recital caused several women at the hearing to weep, and all
within earshot of the steward's story were thrilled.


ANDREWS WAS BRAVE

Stories that Mr. Andrews, the designer of the ship, had tried to
disguise the extent of danger were absolutely denied by Henry Samuel
Etches, his bedroom steward, who told the committee how Mr. Andrews
urged women back to their cabins to dress more warmly and to put on
life-belts.

The steward, whose duty it was to serve Major Butt and his party, told
how he did not see the Major at dinner the evening of the disaster as
he was dining with a private party in the restaurant. William Burke, a
first class steward, told of serving dinner at 7.15 o'clock to Mr. and
Mrs. Straus, and later Mrs. Straus' refusal to leave her husband
was again told to the committee. A bedroom steward told of a quiet
conversation with Benjamin Guggenheim, Senator Guggenheim's brother,
after the accident and shortly before the Titanic settled in the plunge
that was to be his death.

On April 29th Marconi produced copies of several messages which passed
between the Marconi office and the Carpathia in an effort to get
definite information of the wreck and the survivors.

Marconi and F. M. Sammis, chief engineer of the American Marconi
Company, both acknowledged that a mistake had been made in sending
messages to Bride and Cottam on board the Carpathia not to give out any
news until they had seen Marconi and Sammis.

The senatorial committee investigating the Titanic disaster has served
several good purposes. It has officially established the fact that all
nations are censurable for insufficient, antiquated safety regulations
on ocean vessels, and it has emphasized the imperative necessity for
united action among all maritime countries to revise these laws and
adapt them to changed conditions.


The committee reported its findings as follows:

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS

No particular person is named as being responsible, though attention
is called to the fact that on the day of the disaster three distinct
warnings of ice were sent to Captain Smith. J. Bruce Ismay, managing
director of the White Star Line, is not held responsible for the ship's
high speed. In fact, he is barely mentioned in the report.

Ice positions, so definitely reported to the Titanic just preceding
the accident, located ice on both sides of the lane in which she was
traveling. No discussion took place among the officers, no conference
was called to consider these warnings, no heed was given to them. The
speed was not relaxed, the lookout was not increased.

The supposedly water-tight compartments of the Titanic were not
water-tight, because of the non-water-tight condition of the decks where
the transverse bulkheads ended.

The steamship Californian, controlled by the same concern as the
Titanic, was nearer the sinking steamship than the nineteen miles
reported by her captain, and her officers and crew saw the distress
signals of the Titanic and failed to respond to them in accordance with
the dictates of humanity, international usage and the requirements of
law. Had assistance been promptly proffered the Californian might have
had the proud distinction of rescuing the lives of the passengers and
crew of the Titanic.

The mysterious lights on an unknown ship, seen by the passengers on the
Titanic, undoubtedly were on the Californian, less than nineteen miles
away.

Eight ships, all equipped with wireless, were in the vicinity of the
Titanic, the Olympic farthest away--512 miles.

The full capacity of the Titanic's life-boats was not utilized, because,
while only 705 persons were saved, the ship's boats could have carried
1176.

No general alarm was sounded, no whistle blown and no systematic warning
was given to the endangered passengers, and it was fifteen or twenty
minutes after the collision before Captain Smith ordered the Titanic's
wireless operator to send out a distress message.

The Titanic's crew were only meagerly acquainted with their positions
and duties in an accident and only one drill was held before the maiden
trip. Many of the crew joined the ship only a few hours before she
sailed and were in ignorance of their positions until the following
Friday.

Many more lives could have been saved had the survivors been
concentrated in a few life-boats, and had the boats thus released
returned to the wreck for others.

The first official information of the disaster was the message from
Captain Haddock, of the Olympic, received by the White Star Line at
6.16 P. M., Monday, April 15. In the face of this information a message
reporting the Titanic being towed to Halifax was sent to Representative
J. A. Hughes, at Huntington, W. Va., at 7.51 P. M. that day. The message
was delivered to the Western Union office in the same building as the
White Star Line offices.

"Whoever sent this message," says the report, "under the circumstances,
is guilty of the most reprehensible conduct."

The wireless operator on the Carpathia was not duly vigilant in handling
his messages after the accident.

The practice of allowing wireless operators to sell their stories should
be stopped.


RECOMMENDATIONS.

It is recommended that all ships carrying more than 100 passengers shall
have two searchlights.

That a revision be made of steamship inspection laws of foreign
countries to conform to the standard proposed in the United States.

That every ship be required to carry sufficient life-boats for all
passengers and crew.

That the use of wireless be regulated to prevent interference by
amateurs, and that all ships have a wireless operator on constant duty.

Detailed recommendations are made as to water-tight bulkhead
construction on ocean-going ships. Bulkheads should be so spaced
that any two adjacent compartments of a ship might be flooded without
sinking.

Transverse bulkheads forward and abaft the machinery should be continued
watertight to the uppermost continuous structural deck, and this deck
should be fitted water-tight.
