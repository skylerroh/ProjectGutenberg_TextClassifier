TWILIGHT STORIES.

PREFACE.


Most of the simple verses which compose this volume were written for a
very dear child, with no thought beyond her gratification. They are
published at the request of friends, with the hope that other children
may derive the same pleasure from them as the little one for whom they
were first intended.

_Boston, Dec. 4, 1850._

THE FIRST HYMN.


[Illustration]

God made the bright, round sun;
  He made the pretty flowers;
The little birds, the trees, the clouds
  The rain that falls in showers.

He made papa, mamma,
  And baby brother, too;
And mother says He looks from Heaven,
  And sees each thing I do.

Then I must try to be
  Pleasant, and sweet, and mild;
For the good God who made me loves
  A kind, obedient child.

[Illustration]




MORNING HYMN.


[Illustration: Letter N.]

Now again the yellow sun
Shines upon my window-pane;
Now anothor day's begun,
I can laugh and play again.

I must try to-day to be
Kind in all I say and do;
Then will God be pleased with me,
And mamma will love me too.

For she says that God above
Loves to see a little child
Sweet and gentle as the dove,
Like the pretty lamb so mild.




EVENING HYMN.


[Illustration: Letter N.]

Now the sun hath gone to rest,
Stars are coming faint and dim,
And the bird within his nest
Sweetly sings his evening hymn.

Have I tried mamma to mind?
Was I gentle in my play?
Have I been a true and kind,
Pleasant little girl to-day?

Then will God take care of me
Kindly, through the long dark night;
Bright and happy, I shall see
Once again the morning light.




CROSS LOOKS.


[Illustration: Letter W.]

Why, what a frightful face is this!
And what has happened, sir, amiss?
Come, let me wipe these tears away,
And see no more cross looks to-day.

If Kate did throw your blocks about,
She's very sorry, I've no doubt;
And here she stands to tell you so,
And build another house, I know.

No tears and crying here must be,
So have a pleasant smile for me.
There, that will do,--now run away,
And kindly with your sister play.




I MUST NOT BE SELFISH.


[Illustration]

[Illustration: Letter W.]

When I play with little children
  I must very gentle be;
I must always do to others
  As I'd have them do to me.

I must like to give and lend them,
  If they want my prettiest toy;
More than my delight and pleasure
  I must love my playmate's joy.

Children who are kind and loving
  God above is pleased to see;
Let me ever this remember,
  Ever sweet and pleasant be.
