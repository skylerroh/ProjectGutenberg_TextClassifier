[Transcriber's Notes:

Welcome to the schoolroom of 1900. The moral tone is plain. "She is kind
to the old blind man."

The exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful than some
contemporary alternatives. Much is left to the teacher. Explanations given
in the text are enough to get started teaching a child to read and write.
Counting in Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson
numbers.

The author, not listed in the text is William Holmes McGuffey.

Preface

In this book, as well as in the others of the Revised Series, most of the
favorite drill selections, which constituted one of the leading
excellences of MCGUFFEY'S READERS, have been retained. New selections have
been inserted only when they seemed manifest improvements on those
formerly used.

The plan of this Reader is a continuation and extension of that pursued in
the First Reader.

If the pupil is not familiar with the diacritical marks, he should be
carefully drilled, as suggested on page 7, until the marked letter
instantly suggests the correct sound. He is then prepared to study his
reading lessons without any assistance from the teacher.

All new words are given at the head of each lesson. When these are
mastered, the main difficulties left for the pupil are those of
expression. In the latter portion of the book the simpler
derivatives,--such as are formed by adding one or two
letters,--possessives, plurals, verbal forms, etc.,--are omitted if the
primitive word has been given. In this way the pupil is gradually led to
the mastery of words as ordinarily printed.

A few of the most usual abbreviations have been introduced,--such as Mr.,
Mrs., etc. These should be carefully explained, not only as to their
meaning and use, but as to the reason for their use.

Great care has been taken to have the illustrations worthy of the
reputation MCGUFFEY'S READERS have attained, and some of the foremost
designers of this country have contributed to the embellishment of the
book.

Many of these pictures will serve admirably for lessons in language, in
extension and explanation of the text. The imagination of the artist has,
in some cases, filled in details not found in the text.

The thanks of the publishers are due to very many experienced teachers,
who have contributed their valuable suggestions.

June, 1879.

ARTICULATION.

SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.-Thorough and frequent drills on the elementary
sounds are useful in correcting vicious habits of pronunciation and in
strengthening the vocal organs.

As a rule, only one or two sounds should be employed at one lesson. Care
should be taken that the pupils observe and practice these sounds
correctly in their reading.

PUNCTUATION.

Punctuation Marks are used to make the sense more clear.

A Period (.) is used at the end of a sentence, and after an
abbreviation; as,

   James was quite sick. Dr. Jones was called to see him.

An Interrogation Mark (?) is used at the end of a question; as,

   Where is John going?

An Exclamation Mark (!) is used after words or sentences expressing some
strong feeling; as,

   Alas, my noble boy! that thou shouldst die!

The Comma (,), Semicolon (;), and Colon (:) are used to separate the parts
of a sentence.

The Hyphen (-) is used to join the parts of a compound word; as,
text-book: it is also used at the end of a line in print or script, when a
word is divided; as in the word "sentence," near the bottom of page 9.

EVENING AT HOME.

1. It is winter. The cold wind whistles through the branches of the trees.


2. Mr. Brown has done his day's work, and his children, Harry and Kate,
have come home from school. They learned their lessons well to-day, and
both feel happy

3. Tea is over. Mrs. Brown has put the little sitting room in order. The
fire burns brightly. One lamp gives light enough for all. On the stool is
a basket of fine apples. They seem to say, "Won't you have one?"

4. Harry and Kate read a story in a new book. The father reads his
newspaper, and the mother mends Harry's stockings.

5. By and by, they will tell one another what they have been reading
about, and will have a chat over the events of the day.

6. Harry and Kate's bedtime will come first. I think I see them kiss their
dear father and mother a sweet good night.

7. Do you not wish that every boy and girl could have a home like this?

BUBBLES.

1. The boys have come out on the porch to blow bubbles. The old cat is
asleep on the mat by the door.

2. "Ha! ha!" laughs Robert, as a bubble comes down softly on the old cat's
back, and does not burst.
