And the Wild is calling, calling ... let us go."

PREFACE


The object of this book is to present a popular narrative of the Asiatic
Zooelogical Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History to China in
1916-17. Details of a purely scientific nature have been condensed, or
eliminated, and emphasis has been placed upon our experiences with the
strange natives and animals of a remote and little known region in the hope
that the book will be interesting to the general reader.

The scientific reputation of the Expedition will rest upon the technical
reports of its work which will be published in due course by the American
Museum of Natural History. To these reports we would refer those readers
who desire more complete information concerning the results of our
researches. At the time the manuscript of this volume was sent to press the
collections were still undergoing preparation and the study of the
different groups had just begun.

Although the book has been largely written by the senior author, his
collaborator has contributed six chapters marked with her initials; all the
illustrations are from her photographs and continual use has been made of
her daily journals; she has, moreover, materially assisted in reference
work and in numerous other ways.

The information concerning the relationships and distribution of the native
tribes of Yuen-nan is largely drawn from the excellent reference work by
Major H.R. Davies and we have followed his spelling of Chinese names.

Parts of the book have been published as separate articles in the _American
Museum Journal, Harper's Magazine_, and _Asia_ and to the editors of the
above publications our acknowledgments are due.

That the Expedition obtained a very large and representative collection of
small mammals is owing in a great measure to the efforts of Mr. Edmund
Heller, our companion in the field. He worked tirelessly in the care and
preservation of the specimens, and the fact that they reached New York in
excellent condition is, in itself, the best testimony to the skill and
thoroughness with which they were prepared.

Our Chinese interpreter, Wu Hung-tao, contributed largely to the success of
the Expedition. His faithful and enthusiastic devotion to our interests and
his tact and resourcefulness under trying circumstances won our lasting
gratitude and affectionate regard.

The nineteen months during which we were in Asia are among
the most memorable of our lives and we wish to express our deepest
gratitude to the Trustees of the American Museum of Natural History, and
especially to President Henry Fairfield Osborn, whose enthusiastic
endorsement and loyal support made the Expedition possible. Director F.A.
Lucas, Dr. J.A. Allen and Mr. George H. Sherwood were unfailing in
furthering our interests, and to them we extend our hearty thanks.

To the following patrons, who by their generous contributions materially
assisted in the financing of the Expedition, we wish to acknowledge our
great personal indebtedness as well as that of the Museum; Mr. and Mrs.
Charles L. Bernheimer, Mr. and Mrs. Sidney M. Colgate, Messrs. George
Bowdoin, Lincoln Ellsworth, James B. Ford, Henry C. Frick, Childs Frick,
and Mrs. Adrian Hoffman Joline.

The Expedition received many courtesies while in the field from the
following gentlemen, without whose cooeperation it would have been
impossible to have carried on the work successfully. Their services have
been referred to individually in subsequent parts of the book: The Director
of the Bureau of Foreign Affairs of the Province of Yuen-nan; M. Georges
Chemin Dupontes, Director de l'Exploration de la Compagnie Francaise des
Chemins de Fer de l'Indochine et du Yuen-nan, Hanoi, Tonking; M. Henry
Wilden, Consul de France, Shanghai; M. Kraemer, Consul de France, Hongkong;
Mr. Howard Page, Standard Oil Co., Yuen-nan Fu; the Hon. Paul Reinsch,
Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary to the Chinese Republic,
Mr. J.V.A. McMurray, First Secretary of the American Legation, Peking; Mr.
H.G. Evans, British-American Tobacco Co., Hongkong; the Rev. William Hanna,
Ta-li Fu; the Rev. A. Kok, Li-chang Fu; Ralph Grierson, Esq., Teng-yueh;
Herbert Goffe, Esq., H.B.M. Consul General, Yuen-nan Fu; Messrs. C.R.
Kellogg, and H.W. Livingstone, Foochow, China; the General Passenger Agent,
Canadian Pacific Railroad Company, Hongkong; and the Rev. H.R. Caldwell,
Yenping, who has read parts of this book in manuscript and who through his
criticisms has afforded us the benefit of his long experience in China.

To Miss Agnes F. Molloy and Miss Anna Katherine Berger we wish to express
our appreciation of editorial and other assistance during the preparation
of the volume.
